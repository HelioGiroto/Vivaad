'''Outing''' is the act of disclosing a [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) person's [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] without that person's consent. Outing gives rise to issues of privacy, choice, hypocrisy, and harm in addition to sparking debate on what constitutes [[common good]] in efforts to combat [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]]. A publicized outing targets prominent figures in a society, for example well-known politicians, accomplished athletes or popular artists. [[LGBT rights opposition|Opponents to LGBT rights movements]] as well as activists within [[LGBT community|LGBT communities]] have used this type of outing as a controversial political campaign or tactic. In an attempt to thwart or pre-empt being outed, LGBT public figures may decide to [[Coming out|come out]] publicly first.

The term &quot;outing&quot; can also be used to refer to the disclosure of other kinds of information that might be considered private, such as minority religious beliefs, for example being revealed as [[atheist]] in a strongly [[Christian]] community. In the culture of [[hacktivism]], the practice of outing private information is called [[doxing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==History==
It is hard to pinpoint the first use of outing in the modern sense. In a 1982 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', [[Taylor Branch]] predicted that &quot;outage&quot; would become a political tactic in which the [[closeted]] would find themselves trapped in a crossfire. The article &quot;Forcing Gays Out of the Closet&quot; by [[William A. Henry III]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (January 29, 1990) introduced the term &quot;outing&quot; to the general public. (Johansson&amp;Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;4)

While the term is recent, the practice goes back much further. Outing was a common put-down of [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] orators. Before the [[Christian]] era, [[sodomy]] was not illegal in [[Greek law|Greek]] or, most believe, in [[Roman law]], between adult citizens, but [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts between citizens were considered acceptable only under certain social circumstances. Both Romans and Greeks sneeringly deemed the &quot;guilty&quot; vulgar.

The [[Harden-Eulenburg affair]] of 1907–1909 was the first public outing scandal of the twentieth century. [[Left-wing]] journalists opposed to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s policies outed a number of prominent members of his cabinet and inner circle&amp;nbsp;—and by implication the Kaiser&amp;nbsp;—beginning with [[Maximilian Harden]]'s indictment of the aristocratic diplomat [[Philipp Prince zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld|Prince Eulenburg]]. Harden's accusations incited other journalists to follow suit, including [[Adolf Brand]], founder of ''[[Der Eigene]]'', a journal that advocated Greek style [[paederasty]].

Left-wing journalists outed [[Adolf Hitler]]'s closest ally [[Ernst Röhm]] in the early 1930s, causing Brand to write, &quot;when someone&amp;nbsp;—as teacher, priest, representative, or statesman&amp;nbsp;—would like to set in the most damaging way the intimate love contacts of others under degrading control&amp;nbsp;—in that moment his own love-life also ceases to be a private matter and forfeits every claim to remain protected hence-forward from public scrutiny and suspicious oversight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Adolph. ''Political Criminals: A Word About the Röhm Case'' (1931) Reprinted in ''Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany'', edited by Harry Oosterhuis, 235–240. New York, Haworth, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, tabloid publications like ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' appeared, specializing in the revelation of scandalous information about entertainment and political celebrities. Among the political figures targeted by the magazine were former Under Secretary of State [[Sumner Welles]]&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Welles, ''Sumner Welles: FDR's Global Strategist: A Biography'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997),370-1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur H. Vandenberg, Jr.]], who had briefly served as President Eisenhower's [[Secretary_to_the_President_of_the_United_States#Appointments_Secretary|Appointments Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Papers of Dwight David Eisenhower'', vol. 18 (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1966), &quot;Document 48: Eisenhower To Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller,&quot; February 23, 1957, [http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/second-term/documents/48.cfm], accessed November 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Outing may be found to be [[Defamation|libel]] by a court of law. For example, in 1957 American pianist [[Liberace]], who publicly denied being gay or bisexual, successfully sued the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for merely insinuating that he was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovece|first=Frank|title=Michael Douglas plays pianist Liberace in HBO film|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/michael-douglas-plays-pianist-liberace-in-hbo-film-1.3238287|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=October 11, 2011|quote=The highly popular Liberace, who died in 1987 at the age of 67 of AIDS-related causes, publicly denied being gay or bisexual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/getDocument?fileName=DMir_1956_09_26_006&amp;fileType=PDF Yearn-Strength Five]&quot;, ''Daily Mirror'', 26 September 1956, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 2011 interview, actress and close friend [[Betty White]] stated that Liberace was gay, and that she often served as a [[Beard (companion)|beard]] to counter rumors of the musician's homosexuality. {{Cite document |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-wTJ2hQCK8|publisher=youtube |title=CNN Official Interview: Betty White: Bea Arthur was not fond of me}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mirror''{{'}}s defence was that the words complained of, in a column written by [[William Connor]] under his byline 'Cassandra', did not imply that Liberace was gay. The paper did not attempt to prove that the accusation was true: it attempted to prove that no accusation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cry1.htm |publisher=World Wide Words |title=Cry all the way to the bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High Court Of Justice; Queen's Bench Division, &quot;I Don't Care What My Readers Think&quot;, Liberace V.

After the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, swells of [[Gay lib|gay-libbers]] came out aggressively in the 1970s, crying out: &quot;Out of the closets, Into the streets!&quot; Some began to demand that all homosexuals come out, and that if they weren't willing to do so, then it was the community's responsibility to do it for them. One example is the outing of [[Oliver Sipple]] (who saved the life of U.S. President Gerald Ford during an assassination attempt) by gay activists, most prominently [[Harvey Milk]]. The negative impact the outing had on Sipple's life later provoked opposition. Some argued that privacy should prevail, and felt it was better for the movement to protect closeted gays, especially in [[homophobic]] religious institutions and the military. Despite their best efforts, many [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s were still unwilling to come out.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some political [[conservatism|conservatives]] opposed to increased public acceptance of homosexuality engaged in outing in this period as well, with the goal of embarrassing or discrediting their ideological foes.  Conservative commentator [[Dinesh D'Souza]], for example, published the letters of gay fellow students at [[Dartmouth College]] in the campus newspaper he edited (''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'') in 1981; a few years later, succeeding ''Review'' editor [[Laura Ingraham]] had a meeting of a campus gay organization secretly tape-recorded, then published a transcript as part of an editorial denouncing the group as &quot;cheerleaders for latent campus sodomites.&quot;

In the 1980s, the [[AIDS]] pandemic led to the outing of several major entertainers, including [[Rock Hudson]].

The first outing by an activist in America occurred in February 1989. [[Michael Petrelis]], along with a few others, alleged that [[Mark Hatfield]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Oregon]] was gay. They did this because he supported legislation initiated by [[Jesse Helms]]. At a fundraiser in a small town outside of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the group stood up and outed him in front of the crowd. Petrelis later tried to make news by standing on the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] steps and reading the names of &quot;twelve men and women in politics and music who ... are secretly gay.&quot; Though the press showed up, no major news organization published the story. (Gross, p.&amp;nbsp;85) Potential libel suits deterred publishers.

''OutWeek'', which had begun publishing in 1989, was home to activist and outing pioneer [[Michelangelo Signorile]], who stirred the waters when he outed the recently deceased [[Malcolm Forbes]] in March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Signorile  | first = Michelangelo   | title = The Other Side of Malcolm Forbes  | journal = Outweek   | issue = 38  | pages = 40–45   | date = March 18, 1990  | url = http://outweek.net/pdfs/ow_38.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His column &quot;Gossip Watch&quot; became a hot spot for outing the rich and famous. Both praised and lambasted for his behavior, he garnered responses to his actions as wide ranging as &quot;one of the greater contemporary gay heroes,&quot; to &quot;revolting, infantile, cheap name-calling.&quot; (Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;183)

Other people who have been outed include [[Fannie Flagg]], [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]], [[Chastity Bono]], and [[Richard Chamberlain (actor)|Richard Chamberlain]].

In 2004, [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] activist [[Michael Rogers (activist)|Michael Rogers]] outed [[Edward Schrock]], a Republican [[United States Congress|Congressman]] from [[Virginia]]. Rogers posted a story on his website alleging that Schrock used an interactive [[phone sex]] service to meet other men for sex. Schrock did not deny this, and announced on August 30, 2004 that he would not seek re-election. Rogers said that he outed Schrock to punish him for his hypocrisy in voting for the [[Marriage Protection Act]] and signing on as a co-sponsor of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].

[[New Jersey]] Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] announced that he was a &quot;gay American&quot; in August 2004. McGreevey had become aware that he was about to be named in a [[sexual harassment]] suit by [[Golan Cipel]], his former security advisor, with whom it was alleged McGreevey had a sexual relationship. McGreevey resigned, but unlike Schrock, McGreevey decided not to step out of public life.  [[John McCain]]'s Presidential Campaign removed images of Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]] from its website after he was outed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pensitoreview.com/2008/07/11/homohating-alabama-attorney-general-and-chair-of-mccain-campaign-outed-as-gay/ McCain's Alabama Chairman Reportedly Outed – Attorney General Troy King Has a Record of Homophobic Rhetoric] by Jon Ponder, July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often outing is used solely to damage the outed person's reputation, and has thus been controversial.{{Or|date=December 2007}} Some activists, such as U.S. Congressman [[Barney Frank]] argue that outing is appropriate and legitimate in some cases&amp;nbsp;— for example, if the individual is actively working against [[LGBT rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/44/news-ireland.php THE OUTING | David Dreier and his straight hypocrisy]&lt;/ref&gt; Frank clarified, during the 2006 [[Mark Foley scandal]], &quot;I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to [[hypocrisy]]. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = &quot;Episode Guide – episode 86&quot; [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''| publisher = [[HBO]]| date = October 20, 2006 | url = http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/episode/2006_10_20_ep86.html| accessdate = 2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Outrage'' film ===
{{Main|Outrage (2009 film)}}
In 2009, [[Kirby Dick]]'s documentary ''Outrage'' argued that several American political figures have led closeted gay lives while supporting and endorsing legislation that is harmful to the [[gay community]].  The film focused particular attention on [[Idaho]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Larry Craig]], an outspoken opponent of [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] who in 2007 pled guilty to disorderly conduct for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in a public bathroom.  ''Outrage'' featured interviews with several people who claim that [[Governor of Florida]] [[Charlie Crist]] has led a private gay life while publicly opposing [[gay marriage]] and [[gay adoption]].  The film suggests that Crist's 2008 marriage to [[Carole Rome]] was a strategic political decision designed to deflect attention away from rumors about his sexual orientation.
 
Other politicians discussed in the film include former [[Virginia]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Ed Schrock]], [[California]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[David Dreier]], former [[New York City]] [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] [[Ed Koch]], and former [[Louisiana]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim McCrery]]. 

One media personality, [[Shepard Smith]] of ''[[Fox News]]'', is mentioned.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/04/outraged-kirby-dick-kicks-open-washingtons-closet-door-.html 'Outrage': Kirby Dick kicks open Washington's closet door], Patrick Goldstein, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked in an interview why Smith was chosen, Dick replied, &quot;his complicity with the network's homophobic agenda rises to a level of hypocrisy that I felt was worthy of reporting.&quot;&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-listi/ioutragei-an-interview-wi_b_203225.html Outrage: An Interview with Director Kirby Dick], Brad Listi, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', May 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film examines the [[mass media|media’s]] reluctance to discuss issues involving gay politicians despite the many comparable news stories about heterosexual politicians and scandals.  ''Outrage'' describes this behavior as a form of institutionalized homophobia that has resulted in a tacit policy of self-censorship when reporting on these issues.

==Motives==
Gabriel Rotello, once editor of ''OutWeek'', called outing &quot;equalizing&quot;, explaining, &quot;what we have called 'outing' is a primarily journalistic movement to treat homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality in the media...In 1990, many of us in the gay media announced that henceforth we would simply treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equals. We were not going to wait for the perfect, utopian future to arrive before equalizing the two: We were going to do it now. That's what outing really is: equalizing [[homosexuality]] and [[heterosexuality]] in the media.&quot; (&quot;Why I Oppose Outing&quot;, ''OutWeek'', May 29, 1991)

Their aim is not only to reveal the hypocrisy of those in what Branch termed the &quot;closets of power&quot; but also a gay person awareness of the presence of gay people and political issues, thus showing that being [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] is not &quot;so utterly grotesque that it should never be discussed.&quot; (Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;78) Richard Mohr noted, &quot;some people have compared outing to [[McCarthyism]]...And vindictive outing is like McCarthyism: such outing feeds gays to the wolves, who thereby are made stronger....But the sort of outing I have advocated does not invoke, mobilize, or ritualistically confirm anti-gay values; rather it cuts against them, works to undo them. The point of outing, as I have defended it, is not to wreak vengeance, not to punish, and not to deflect attention from one's own debased state. Its point is to avoid degrading oneself.&quot; Thus outing is &quot;both permissible and an expected consequence of living [[morally]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mohr, Richard. ''Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies'', Boston: Beacon Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, outing is not the airing of private details. As Signorile asked, &quot;How can being gay be private when being straight isn't? [[Sex]] is private. But by outing we do not discuss anyone's sex life. We only say they're gay.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Signorile, p. 80&quot;&gt;Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;80&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Average people have been outed for decades. People have always outed the [[Mail carrier|mailman]] and the [[milkman]] and the [[spinster]] who lives down the block. If anything, the goal behind outing is to show just how many gay people there are among the most visible people in our society so that when someone outs the milkman or the spinster, everyone will say, 'So what?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Signorile, p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all who take a position on outing have qualified the limits to which it is permissible for one to go. The extremes are to out no one or to out everyone. In between, four intermediate positions can be discerned:&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;228&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#[[Hypocrite]]s only, and only when they actively oppose gay rights and interests;
#Outing passive accomplices who help run homophobic institutions;
#Prominent individuals whose outing would shatter [[stereotype]]s and compel the public to reconsider its attitude on homosexuality;
#Only the dead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Assessing to which degree the outer goes allows insight into the goal striven towards. Most outers target those who support decisions and further policy, both [[religious]] and [[secular]], which discriminate against gay people while they themselves live a [[wiktionary:clandestine|clandestine]] gay existence. A &quot;truism to people active in the gay movement [is] that the greatest impediments to homosexuals' progress often [are] not heterosexuals, but closeted homosexuals,&quot; said [[San Francisco]] journalist [[Randy Shilts]].&lt;ref&gt;Johansson &amp; Percy, p.&amp;nbsp;226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and effectiveness==
The effectiveness of outing as a political tactic depends on the willingness of the media to report that a person has been outed. The advent of the internet has made outing public figures much easier. Twenty years ago Michael Rogers would have had to persuade a newspaper or other media outlet to risk legal action by reporting his allegations about Congressman Ed Schrock. Today he can publish them himself on his website and other media will then report that he has done so.

Signorile argues that the outing of journalist [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]] &quot;and its aftermath did indeed make a big dent in the military's policy against gays. The publicity generated put the policy on the front burner in 1992, thrusting the issue into the presidential campaign,&quot; with every Democratic candidate and independent Ross Perot publicly promising to end the ban. (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;161).

==Outing in the military==
{{Main|Sexual orientation and military service}}
{{See also|Don't ask, don't tell}}

The [[military|military forces]] of the world have differing approaches to the enlistment of [[gay]] and [[lesbian]], and [[bisexual]] individuals. Some have open policies, others prohibit, and some are ambiguous.  The armed forces of most developed countries have now removed policies excluding [[non-heterosexual]] individuals (with strict policies on [[sexual harassment]]). 

Nations that permit gay people to serve openly in the military include the 4 of the 5 members of the UN Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, and Russia), the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), [[Australia]], [[Israel]], [[Argentina]], and all [[NATO]] members excluding [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. [http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0607_dont_ask_dont_tell_singer.aspx &quot;What Our Military Allies Can Tell Us About The End of Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;], [http://www.brookings.edu/ The Brookings Institution], 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United kingdom the Ministry of Defense policy since the year 2000 is to allow homosexual men, lesbians and [[transgender]] personnel to serve openly, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=10083 Queer:Argentinien und die Philippinen beenden Homo-Verbot im Militär (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]].

In the United States LGBT people are allowed to serve openly in the [[United States]] military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the U.S. Congress voted to repeal the policy. The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the [[LGBT movements in the United States|gay rights movements]] of the 1970s and 1980s, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with [[liberalism in the United States|socially liberal]] efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and [[conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.

==Support for outing==
Some gay rights activists defend outing as a tactic. The [[United Kingdom|British]] activist [[Peter Tatchell]] says &quot;The lesbian and gay community has a right to defend itself against public figures who abuse their power and influence to support policies which inflict suffering on homosexuals.&quot; In 1994 Tatchell's activist group [[OutRage!]] alleged that fourteen bishops of the [[Church of England]] were homosexual or bisexual and named them, accusing them of hypocrisy for upholding the Church's policy of regarding homosexual acts as [[sinful]] while not observing this prohibition in their personal lives.
&quot;Outing is [[queer]] self-defence,&quot; Tatchell says. &quot;Lesbians and gay men have a right, and a duty, to expose hypocrites and homophobes. By not outing gay Bishops who support policies which harm homosexuals, we would be protecting those Bishops and thereby allowing them to continue to inflict suffering on members of our community. Collusion with hypocrisy and homophobia is not ethically defensible for Christians, or for anyone else.&quot;

==Criticism==
Some gay activists, however, continue to disapprove of outing as a political tactic, arguing that even anti-gay conservatives have a right to personal privacy which should be respected. Steven Fisher, a spokesman for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], the largest advocacy group for gay and lesbian issues in the United States, commenting on the Schrock outing, said he opposed using &quot;sexual orientation as a weapon.&quot; Christopher Barron, political director of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a group representing gay and lesbian Republicans said: &quot;We disagree strongly with the outing campaign, but we also strongly disagree with President Bush's sponsorship of the anti-family [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].&quot;

Roger Rosenblatt argued in his January 1993 [[New York Times Magazine]] essay &quot;Who Killed Privacy?&quot; that, &quot;The practice of 'outing' homosexuals implies contradictorily that homosexuals have a right to private choice but not to private lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Signorile, p. 80&quot;/&gt; In March 2002, singer [[Will Young]] revealed he was gay, pre-empting a tabloid newspaper that was preparing to out him.

Other criticism concerning outing centers upon the harm that outing individuals as homosexual, transgender, or transsexual does to them personally and professionally and upon the fact that some individuals have been erroneously outed or have been outed when there is no proof to substantiate the claim that they are gay, transgendered, or transsexual.

[[Christine Jorgensen]], [[Beth Elliott]], [[Renée Richards]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], [[Billy Tipton]], [[Alan L. Hart]], [[April Ashley]], [[Caroline Cossey]] (&quot;Tula&quot;), [[Jahna Steele]], and [[Nancy Jean Burkholder]] were outed as transsexuals by European or American media or, in the case of Billy Tipton, by his [[coroner]]. In many cases, being outed had an adverse effect on their personal lives and their careers.

In some cases well-known celebrities have been outed as [[transgender]] or [[intersexuality|intersex]] when no proof to substantiate the claims was presented, e.g., [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/jamie.htm snopes.com: Jamie Lee Curtis rumor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in entertainment==
Outing has been featured in comedy films as well, such as the French comedy ''[[Le Placard]]'' (''The Closet''), where a heterosexual man is falsely outed, or in the 1997 comedy ''[[In &amp; Out]]'' where [[Kevin Kline]] stars as a small-town teacher who gets outed on national television, and is then forced to come to terms with his own unrecognized homosexuality.

In Season 5 the television series [[The L Word]], the issue of public outing is addressed in the form of Alice Pieszecki, a web-journalist, outing a basketball player who made offensive comments toward gay people while himself being gay. She also ambiguously outs lesbian [[actress]] [[Niki Stevens]] while guest-hosting a fictional talk show called ''The Look''.
