'''Citizenship''' denotes the link between a person and a [[state (polity)|state]] or an association of states. It is normally synonymous with the term [[nationality]] although the latter term is sometimes understood to have ethnic connotations.{{Contradict-inline|article=Nationality|date=September 2012}}&lt;!-- [[Nationality]] article gives other meaning too of &quot;nationality&quot; and have a comparison between it and &quot;Citizenship&quot; [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship]]--&gt; Possession of citizenship is normally associated with the right to work and live in a country and to participate in political life. A person who does not have citizenship in any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]].

'''Nationality''' is often used as a synonym for citizenship – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |page=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors determining citizenship==
{{see|Nationality law}}

The modern sense of citizenship is usually based on one or more of these factors:

* '''Parents are citizens'''. If a person has one or both parents who are citizens of a given state, then the person is normally a citizen of that state as well. Citizenship granted in this fashion is referred to by the Latin phrase ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' meaning &quot;right of blood&quot; and means that citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]], and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. A person could be born outside of the physical territory of a country, but if his or her parents are citizens, then the child is a citizen as well. States normally limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state. This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.

* '''Born within a country'''. Many people are presumed to be citizens of a state if they were born within its territory. Citizenship granted in this fashion is referred to by the Latin phrase ''[[jus soli]]'' meaning &quot;right of soil&quot;. This form of citizenship in common in [[common law]] countries and originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm was subjects of the king.

* '''Marriage to a citizen'''. Citizenship can also be obtained by marrying a citizen, which is termed ''[[jure matrimonii]]''.

* '''[[Naturalization]]'''. States normally grant citizenship to people who have immigrated to that state and have resided there for the given number of years. Sometimes aspiring citizens may have to pass a test, swear allegiance to their new state and renounce their prior citizenship.

==History==
{{Main|History of citizenship}}

===Polis citizenship===
{{Main|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for mankind, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;tws2Y17&quot;/&gt; The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might &quot;really have worked&quot; only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12&gt;{{Cite book

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves or [[barbarians]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one’s everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: “To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!” This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas of citizenship===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realised that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency; it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Civis romanus sum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that &quot;no one citizen should have too much power for too long&quot;,.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1988{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; A citizen came to be understood as a person &quot;free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community.&quot;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were &quot;available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason.&quot;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} And the law, itself, was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During European Middle Ages, citizenship was usually associated with cities, see [[bourgeoisie|burgher]], [[Grand Burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[Bourgeoisie]]. [[Nobility]] used to have [[privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), but the [[French Revolution]] and other revolutions revoked these privileges and made citizens.

===Renaissance===
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through &quot;elaborate systems of political representation at a distance&quot; such as [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

==Different senses of citizenship==
[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|400px|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History_of_citizenship#Competing_senses_of_citizenship|History of citizenship]].]]

Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both rights and responsibilities. In this sense, citizenship was described as &quot;a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a &quot;broad bond&quot; linking &quot;a person with the state&quot; and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15&gt;{{Cite book

According to this viewpoint, citizens are sovereign, morally autonomous beings with duties to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack,&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; but are essentially passive politically,&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; and their primary focus is on economic betterment. This idea began to appear around the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and became stronger over time, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to this formulation, the state exists for the benefit of citizens and has an obligation to respect and protect the rights of citizens, including civil rights and political rights.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; It was later that so-called social rights became part of the obligation for the state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

* The '''civic-republican''' or sometimes ''classical'' or ''civic humanist'' conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]]. Citizenship means being active in government affairs.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; According to one view, most people today live as citizens according to the liberal-individualist conception but wished they lived more according to the civic-republican ideal.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; An ideal citizen is one who exhibits &quot;good civic behavior&quot;.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Free citizens and a republic government are &quot;mutually interrelated.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship suggested a commitment to &quot;duty and civic virtue&quot;.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duty|duties]] and [[rights]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some see these two aspects of citizenship as incompatible, such that [[social rights]] have gone too far with not enough emphasis on ''duties'' citizens owe to the state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Another is a question about what is the proper balance between ''political citizenship'' versus ''social citizenship''.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to [[political science|political scientist]] Arthur Stinchcombe, citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

==International citizenship==
In recent years, some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''&quot;The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy&quot;''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===Commonwealth citizenship===
The concept of &quot;[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]&quot; has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] left the Commonwealth in 1949, it is often treated as if it were a member, with references being made in legal documents to 'the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland', and its citizens are not classified as foreign nationals, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

===European Union citizenship===
{{Main|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: the consolidated version.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rome&quot;&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rome&quot; /&gt; established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States&lt;ref&gt;Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.&lt;/ref&gt; which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L’Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subnational citizenship==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as &quot;citizens&quot; of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The [[United States]] has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

==Citizenship education==
{{Main|Citizenship education }}
&quot;[[Active citizenship]]&quot; is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, [[school]]s in some countries provide [[citizenship education]].

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called &quot;Modern Studies&quot; which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
It is taught in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics &amp; Society' is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
