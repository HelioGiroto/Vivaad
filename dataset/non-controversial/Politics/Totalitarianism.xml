{{Forms of government}}
'''Totalitarianism''' (or '''totalitarian rule''') is a [[political system]] where the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflections2&quot;&gt;[[Robert Conquest]]''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000) ISBN 0-393-04818-7, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of totalitarianism was first developed in a positive sense in the 1920s by the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. The concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era in order to highlight perceived similarities between [[Nazi Germany]] and other [[fascism|fascist]] regimes on the one hand, and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Defty, Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945-1953: The Information Research Department, 2007, chapters 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achim Siegel, The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment, 1998, page 200 &quot;Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War. Since the late 1940s, especially since the Korean War, they were condensed into a far-reaching, even hegemonic, ideology, by which the political elites of the Western world tried to explain and even to justify the Cold War constellation&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Guilhot, The democracy makers: human rights and international order, 2005, page 33 &quot;The opposition between the West and Soviet totalitarianism was often presented as an opposition both moral and epistemological between truth and falsehood. The democratic, social, and economic credentials of the Soviet Union were typically seen as &quot;lies&quot; and as the product of a deliberate and multiform propaganda...In this context, the concept of totalitarianism was itself an asset. As it made possible the conversion of prewar anti-fascism into postwar anti-communism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, Politics and the novel during the Cold War, 2009, pages 95-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Reisch, How the Cold War transformed philosophy of science: to the icy slopes of logic, 2005, pages 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from fascist and Stalinist movements, there have been other movements that are totalitarian. The leader of the historic Spanish [[reactionary]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] movement called the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] declared his intention to &quot;give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity...&quot; and went on to say &quot;[[Democracy]] is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either [[parliament]] submits or we will eliminate it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston. ''The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge''. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==	
[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]]]]
The notion of &quot;totalitarianism&quot; a &quot;total&quot; political power by state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]] who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;regime&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pipes|1995|pp=240–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy’s most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]]. He used the term “totalitario” to refer to the structure and goals of the new state. The new state was to provide the “total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, Fascism: Comparison and Definition (UW Press, 1980), porn. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He described totalitarianism as a society in which the ideology of the state had influence, if not power, over most of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gentile &amp; B. Mussolini in &quot;La dottrina del fascismo&quot; (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benito Mussolini]], this system politicizes everything spiritual and human:
	
{{Quotation2||Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;regime&quot;/&gt;}}

As an example, he stated that &quot;We must finish once and for all with the neutrality of chess. We must condemn once and for all the formula 'chess for the sake of chess', like the formula 'art for art's sake'. We must organize shockbrigades of chess-players, and begin immediate realization of a Five-Year Plan for chess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest. ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'', Oxford University Press, 1990, ISBN 0-19-507132-8 p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between authoritarian and totalitarian regimes==
The term 'an [[authoritarian regime]]' denotes a state in which the single power holder - an individual '[[dictator]]', a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite - monopolizes political power. However, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life including [[economy]], education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. &quot;The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens .&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;regime&quot;/&gt;

Totalitarianism is an extreme version of [[authoritarianism]]. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control.  Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondrol&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in &quot;key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]&quot;:

{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic '[[cult of personality|mystique]]' and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:Concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings, largely content to control; and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a [[person]] than an indispensable 'function' to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondrol&quot;/&gt;}}

Thus, compared to totalitarian systems, authoritarian systems may also leave a larger sphere for [[Private sphere|private life]], lack a guiding ideology, tolerate some [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] in social organization, lack the power to mobilize the whole population in pursuit of national goals, and exercise their power within relatively predictable limits.

==Examples of the term's use==
One of the first to use the term &quot;totalitarianism&quot; in the English language was the Austrian writer [[Franz Borkenau]] in his 1938 book ''The Communist International'', in which he commented that it more united the Soviet and German dictatorships than divided them.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoianu, Virgil, Review of ''End and Beginnings'' pages 1235-1238 from MLN, Volume 97, Issue # 5, December 1982, p.1235.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isabel Paterson]], in ''The God of the Machine'' (1943), used the term in connection with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13774, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adolf Hitler]] speaks]]
F.A. Hayek  helped develop the idea of totalitarianism in his classic defense of economic competition ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944). In his Introduction, Hayek contrasts Western Anglo values with Nazi Germany under [[Adolf Hitler]], stating that &quot;the conflict between the National-Socialist &quot;Right&quot; and the &quot;Left&quot; in Germany is the kind of conflict that will always arise between rival socialist factions&quot;. He later conflates &quot;Germany, Italy and Russia&quot; going on to say that &quot;the history of these countries in the years before the rise of the totalitarian system showed few features with which we are not familiar&quot; (Chapter 1, The Abandoned Road).

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed that &quot;The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable&quot;, and that [[Marxism-Leninism]] was much the most successful type of totalitarianism, as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the Red Army's role in defeating Germany. Only the &quot;blind and incurable&quot; could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the &quot;open society&quot; of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism, and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.

In ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazi]] and [[State communist]] regimes were new forms of government, and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their ideology, which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present, and future. For [[Nazism]], all history is the history of [[race struggle]]; and, for [[Marxism]], all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature|appeal to Nature]] or the [[Historicism|Law of History]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, p.2-3. ISBN 0-521-64571-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as Lawrence Aronsen, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Franz Borkenau]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Karl Popper]], Eckhard Jesse, [[Leonard Schapiro]], [[Adam Ulam]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Richard Löwenthal]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] and [[Juan Linz]] describe totalitarianism in slightly different ways. They all agree, however, that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official state [[ideology]], and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the state, entailing repression or state control of [[business]], [[labour union]]s, [[church (building)|church]]es or [[political party|political parties]].

==Cold War-era research==
[[File:Stalin birthday.jpg|thumb|160px|Chinese communists celebrate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s 70th birthday, 1949]]
[[File:Brzezinski_1977.jpg|thumb|160px|A number of thinkers, including [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], have argued that Nazi and Soviet regimes were equally totalitarian.]]
The political scientists [[Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] were primarily responsible for expanding the usage of the term in university social science and professional research, reformulating it as a paradigm for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as [[fascist]] regimes. For Friedrich and Brzezinski, the defining elements were intended to be taken as a mutually supportive organic entity composed of the following: an elaborating guiding ideology; [[single-party state|a single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]]; a [[state terrorism|system of terror]]; a monopoly of the means of communication and physical force; and central direction, and control of the economy through [[planned economy|state planning]]. Such regimes had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]], at which point the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled totalitarian movements to consolidate power.

The German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the &quot;totalitarian typology&quot; as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model, and failed to consider the “revolutionary dynamic” that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw, Ian page 25&quot;&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership, and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian &quot;closed&quot; understanding of politics from the &quot;open&quot; democratic understanding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw, Ian page 25&quot;/&gt; Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter'' The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 page 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Hoffer]] in his book ''[[The True Believer]]'' argues that mass movements like [[communism]], Fascism and [[Nazi]]sm had a common trait in picturing [[Western world|Western]] democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people &quot;too soft, too [[Hedonism|pleasure-loving]] and too [[selfish]]&quot; to [[sacrifice]] for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and &quot;fact-proof screens from reality&quot; are established.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), ISBN 0-06-050591-5, p.61, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and recent work with the concept==
In the [[social science]]s, the approach of Friedrich and Brzezinski came under criticism from scholars who argued that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 pages 186-189 &amp; 233-234&lt;/ref&gt; These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this '[[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]]' approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.
{{further|Collective leadership|History of the Soviet Union (1964–1982)}}

From a historical angle, the totalitarian concept has been criticized. Historians of the Nazi period inclined towards a functionalist interpretation of the Third Reich such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Hans Mommsen]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] have been very hostile or lukewarm towards the totalitarianism concept, arguing that the Nazi regime was far too disorganized to be considered as totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Chris &quot;Broszat, Martin&quot; pages 143-144 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 1, edited by Kelly Boyd, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999 page 143; Kerhsaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 45-46; Menke, Martin &quot;Mommsen, Hans&quot; pages 826-827 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Soviet history, the concept has been disparaged by the &quot;revisionist&quot; school, a group of mostly American left-wing historians, some of whose more prominent members are [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], [[Jerry F. Hough]], William McCagg, Robert W. Thurston, and [[J. Arch Getty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227&quot;&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 pages 225-227&lt;/ref&gt; Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under Stalin was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated, and that to the extent it occurred, it reflected the weaknesses rather the strengths of the Soviet state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227&quot;/&gt; Fitzpatrick argued that since to the extent that there was terror in the Soviet Union, since it provided for increased social mobility, and thus far from being a terrorized society, most people in the Soviet Union supported Stalin's purges as a chance for a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 pages 225 &amp; 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] commented that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality, and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as totalitarian state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur, Walter page 228&quot;&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 page 228&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur argued the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laqueur, Walter page 228&quot;/&gt; Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]] used the term &quot;[[totalitarian twins]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Furet, borrowing from [[Hannah Arendt]], describes [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazis]] as totalitarian twins, conflicting yet united.&quot; [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19950417/singer (Daniel Singer, ''The Nation'' - April 17, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to link [[Stalinism]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable.&quot; [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19991213/singer/3 (Daniel Singer)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The government of [[Nazi Germany]] was a fascist, totalitarian state.&quot; [http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.nazi.html (Gary M. Grobman)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarianism in architecture==
Non-political aspects of the culture and motifs of totalitarian countries have themselves often been labeled innately &quot;totalitarian&quot;. For example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]], a British author, physician, and political commentator, has written for ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' that [[Brutalism|brutalist structures]] are an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as [[gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian|date=Autumn 2009|author=[[Theodore Dalrymple]]|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', author [[George Orwell]] described the [[Ministry of Truth]] as an &quot;enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air&quot;; [[columnist]] [[Ben Macintyre]] of ''[[The Times]]'' has stated that that was &quot;a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|title=Look on those monuments to megalomania, and despair|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=[[Ben Macintyre]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of totalitarianism in architecture is the [[Panopticon]], a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late eighteenth century. The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without their being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. It was invoked by Michel Foucault (in [[Discipline and Punish]]) as metaphor for &quot;disciplinary&quot; societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise.

==In popular culture==
George Orwell's books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' are famous for their dystopian depiction of totalitarian society, as is their lesser-known predecessor, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]. Additional totalitarian regimes are also depicted in ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] and ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]].

According to Soviet writer [[Fazil Iskander]],&lt;ref name=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000) ISBN 0-393-04818-7, page 189&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Under the totalitarian regime, it was as if you were forced to live in the same room with an insanely violent man.&quot;

In Suzanne Collins' trilogy, [[The Hunger Games]], the nation of [[Panem]] is ruled under a totalitarian government.

In the Shadow Children series by Margaret Peterson Haddix, the country is ruled under a totalitarian government.
