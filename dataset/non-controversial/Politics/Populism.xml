'''Populism''' has been viewed as a political [[ideology]], [[political philosophy]], or as a type of discourse. Generally, populists tend to claim that they side with &quot;the people&quot; against &quot;the elites&quot;. While for much of the twentieth century, populism was considered to be a political phenomenon mostly affecting [[Latin America]], since the 1980s populist movements and parties have enjoyed degrees of success in [[First World]] democracies such as the USA, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries.

==Academic definitions==
Academic and scholarly definitions of populism have varied widely over the past decades and the term has often been employed in loose and inconsistent ways to denote appeals to ‘the people’, ‘[[demagogy]]’ and ‘[[Big tent|catch-all]]’ politics or as a receptacle for new types of parties whose classification is unclear. A factor traditionally held to diminish the value of ‘populism’ as a category has been that, as [http://books.google.it/books/about/Populism.html?id=PUO6AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Margaret Canovan notes in her 1981 study] ''Populism'', unlike conservatives or socialists, populists rarely call themselves ‘populists’ and usually reject the term when it is applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Canovan, Margaret, 1981,''Populism'', New York and London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in recent years academic scholars have produced definitions of populism which enable populist identification and comparison. [http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/023001349X.pdf Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell define populism] as an ideology that &quot;pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous ‘others’ who were together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi, Daniele and Duncan McDonnell, 2008, ''Twenty-First Century Populism: The Spectre of Western European Democracy'', New York and London: Palgrave Macmillan, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than viewing populism in terms of specific social bases, economic programs, issues, or electorates — as discussions of right-wing populism have tended to do&lt;ref&gt;Kitschelt, Herbert (with McGann, Anthony), 1995, ''The Radical Right in Western Europe. A Comparative Analysis'', Ann Arbor: University of Michighan Press&lt;/ref&gt; — this type of definition is in line with the approaches of scholars such as [[Ernesto Laclau]],&lt;ref&gt;Laclau, Ernesto, 2005, ''On Populist Reason'', London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Andre Taguieff]],&lt;ref&gt;Taguieff, Pierre-Andre, 2002, ''L'illusion populiste'', Paris: Berg International&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yves Meny]] and [[Yves Surel]],&lt;ref&gt;Meny, Yves and Surel, Yves, 2002, ''Democracies and the Populist Challenge'', London: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; who have all sought to focus on populism ''per se'', rather than treating it simply as an appendage of other ideologies.

Although in the US and Europe, it currently tends to be associated with right-wing parties, the central tenet of populism that democracy should reflect the pure and undiluted will of the people, means it can sit easily with ideologies of both [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]]. However, while leaders of populist movements in recent decades have claimed to be on either the left or the right of the [[political spectrum]], there are also many populists who reject such classifications and claim to be neither &quot;left wing&quot;, &quot;[[centrism|centrist]]&quot; nor &quot;right wing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;canovan&quot;&gt;Canovan, Margaret. 1981. ''Populism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betz, Hans-Georg. 1994. ''Radical Right-wing Populism in Western Europe.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazin, Michael. 1995.''The Populist Persuasion: An American History.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although &quot;populist&quot; is often used pejoratively in the media and in political debate, exceptions to this do exist, notably in the United States. In this case, it appears likely that this is due to the memories and traditions of earlier democratic movements (for example,  farmers' movements, [[New Deal]] reform movements, and the civil rights movement) that were often called populist, by supporters and outsiders alike. It may also be due to linguistic confusions of populism with terms such as &quot;popular&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Boyte, Populism and John Dewey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and methods==
Some scholars argue that populist organizing for empowerment represents the return of older &quot;Aristotelian&quot; politics of horizontal interactions among equals who are different, for the sake of public problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Harry C. Boyte, &quot;A Different Kind of Politics&quot;, Dewey Lecture, University of Michigan, 2002. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/good_society/v012/12.2boyte.html Online ] at [[Project MUSE]] (login needed to see PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Populism has taken left-wing, right-wing, and even centrist&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The basic ideology of the middle class is populism.... Their ideal was an independent small property owning class consisting of merchants, mechanics, and farmers. This element...now designated as middle class, sponsored a system of private property, profit, and competition on an entirely different basis from that conceived by capitalism....From its very inception it opposed &quot;big business&quot; or what has now become known capitalism.&quot; [[David J. Saposs]], quoted in &quot;[[Political Man]]&quot;, [[Lipset]]&lt;/ref&gt; forms, as well as forms of politics that bring together groups and individuals of diverse [[Partisanship|partisan]] views.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Wood, Faith in Action: Religion, Race, and Democratic Organizing in America, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The use of populist rhetoric in the United States has recently included references such as &quot;the powerful [[tort|trial lawyer]] lobby&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-27/local/me-59276_1_trial-lawyers Ignore the Lawyers, Help the People – The powerful trial lawyers lobby must not be allowed to stymie tort reform.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancourthouse.com/2008/11/05/trial-lawyer-lobby-scores-several-big-victories-but-signs-of-hope-in-a-tough-election-year.html Trial Lawyer Lobby Scores Several Big Victories — But Signs Of Hope In A Tough Election Year]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the [[liberal elite]]&quot;, or &quot;the [[Hollywood]] elite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.heritage.org/2009/01/27/and-the-winner-isthe-hollywood-elite/ And The Winner Is…The Hollywood Elite], January 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of populist rhetoric on the other side of the political spectrum is the anti-corporate greed views of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement and the theme of &quot;[[Two Americas]]&quot; in the 2004 Presidential [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] campaign of [[John Edwards]].

Populists are seen by some politicians as a largely [[democracy|democratic]] and positive force in society, while a wing of scholarship in political science contends that populist mass movements are irrational and introduce instability into the political process. [[Margaret Canovan]] argues that both these polar views are faulty, and has defined two main branches of modern populism worldwide—''[[agrarianism|agrarian]]'' and ''political''—and mapped out seven disparate sub-categories:

&lt;!--Please do NOT update the lines in this list with newer or different examples - these represent Canovan's text--&gt;
'''Agrarian'''
* Commodity farmer movements with radical economic agendas such as the [[Populist Party (United States)|US People's Party]] of the late 19th century.
* Subsistence peasant movements, such as the [[Green armies|Eastern European Green Rising]] militias, which followed World War I.
* Intellectuals who [[romanticism|romanticize]] hard-working farmers and peasants and build radical [[agrarian]] movements like the Russian ''[[narodnik]]i''.
'''Political'''
* Populist democracy, including calls for more political participation through reforms such as the use of popular [[referendum]]s.
* Politicians' populism marked by non-ideological appeals for &quot;the people&quot; to build a unified coalition.
* [[Reactionary]] populism, such as the white backlash harvested by [[George Wallace]].
* Populist [[dictatorship]], such as that established by [[Getúlio Vargas]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Canovan, Populism, pp. 13, 128–138&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Canovan's list that only lists right-wing political populist reactions, leftist movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[Cambodia]]'s &quot;[[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]]&quot; campaign would also be examples of political populism.

==Nazism and populism==
It is believed by some that populist movements can be precursors for, or building blocks for, [[Fascism|fascist]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Ferkiss 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobratz and Shanks–Meile 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlet and Lyons, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracist]] [[scapegoating]] employed by various populist movements can create &quot;a seedbed for fascism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rupert 1997: 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National socialism|National socialist]] populism interacted with and facilitated fascism in interwar Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, distressed middle–class populists during the pre-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period mobilized their anger at government and big business. The Nazis &quot;parasitized the forms and themes of the populists and moved their constituencies far to the right through ideological appeals involving [[demagoguery]], scapegoating, and conspiracism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berlet 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fritzsche:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Nazis expressed the populist yearnings of middle–class constituents and at the same time advocated a strong and resolutely anti-Marxist mobilization....Against &quot;unnaturally&quot; divisive parties and querulous organized interest groups, National Socialists cast themselves as representatives of the commonwealth, of an allegedly betrayed and neglected German public....[b]reaking social barriers of status and [[caste]], and celebrating at least rhetorically the populist ideal of the people's community...&lt;ref name=&quot;Fritzsche 1990: 233-235&quot;&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 233–235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History in Europe==

===Classical populism===
The word populism is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''populus'', which means ''people'' in English (in the sense of &quot;folk&quot;, &quot;nation&quot;, as in: &quot;The Roman People&quot; (''[[populus Romanus]]''), ''not'' in the sense of &quot;multiple individual persons&quot; as in: &quot;There are people visiting us today&quot;). Therefore, populism espouses government by the people as a whole (that is to say, the masses). This is in contrast to [[elitism]], [[aristocracy]], [[synarchy]] or [[plutocracy]], each of which is an ideology that espouse government by a small, privileged group above the masses.

Populism has been a common political phenomenon throughout history. The [[Populares]] were an unofficial faction in the [[Roman senate]] whose supporters were known for their populist agenda. Some of the best known of these were [[Tiberius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Caesar Augustus]], all of whom eventually used [[referendum]]s to bypass the [[Roman Senate]] and appeal to the people directly.

===Early modern period===
Populism rose during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups like the [[Anabaptists]] formed ideas about ideal [[theocratic]] societies, in which peasants would be able to read the Bible themselves. Attempts to establish these societies were made during the [[German Peasants' War]] (1524–1525) and the [[Münster Rebellion]] (1534–1535). The peasant movement ultimately failed as cities and nobles made their own peace with the princely armies, which restored the old order under the nominal overlordship of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], represented in German affairs by his younger brother [[Ferdinand]].

The same conditions contributed to the outbreak of the [[English Revolution]] of 1642–1651, also known as the [[English Civil War]]. Conditions led to a proliferation of ideologies and political movements among peasants, self-employed [[artisan]]s, and working-class people in England. Many of these groups had a dogmatic Protestant religious bent. They included [[Puritans]] and the [[Levellers]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Religious revival===
[[Romanticism]], the anxiety against [[rationalism]], broadened after the beginnings of the European and [[Industrial Revolution]]s because of cultural, social, and political insecurity. Romanticism led directly to a strong popular desire to bring about religious revival, nationalism and populism. The ensuing religious revival eventually blended into political populism and [[nationalism]], becoming at times a single entity and a powerful force of public will for change. This [[paradigm shift]] was marked by people looking for security and community because of a strong emotional need to escape from anxiety and to believe in something larger than themselves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The revival of religiosity all over Europe played an important role in bringing people to populism and nationalism. In France, [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] provided the opening shots of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revivalism as he opposed enlightenment's [[materialism]] with the &quot;mystery of life&quot;, the human need for [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.pt/books?id=hxeLLwAxIhUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Chateaubriand+mystery+of+life%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cVnidNV0Ek&amp;sig=9Ur_xUaCSHZLfdl24GDD0UVW95k&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ei=mSIqS4bZL9OZjAeureCTBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Three Minute Declamations for College Men, H. C. Davis,J. C. Bridgeman, The Mysteries of Life, Chateaubriand]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher]] promoted [[pietism]] by stating that religion was not the [[institution]], but a mystical [[piety]] and sentiment with [[Christ]] as the mediating figure raising the human [[consciousness]] above the mundane to [[God]]'s level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtio.com/articles/aissar3.htm &quot;THE ROOTS AND FRUITS OF PIETISM&quot;, Ronald R. Feuerhahn, Concordia Historical Institute &amp; the Luther Academy, September 17–18, 1998, PIEPER LECTURES 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[John Wesley]]'s [[Methodism]] split with the [[Anglican church]] because of its emphasis on the salvation of the masses as a key to moral reform, which Wesley saw as the answer to the social problems of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexloiz.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/methodism-and-the-mob-%E2%80%93-what-it-really-takes-to-change-a-culture/ Methodism and the Mob – what it really takes to change a culture, Lex Loizides' Blog, November 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of ultramontanism===
Chateaubriand's beginning brought about two [[Catholic Revival]]s in France: first, a conservative revival led by [[Joseph de Maistre]], which defended [[ultramontanism]], which is a religious philosophy placing strong emphasis on the supremacy of the [[Pope]], and a second populist revival led by [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais]], an excommunicated priest. This religious populism opposed ultramontanism and emphasized a church community dependent upon all the people, not just the elite. It stressed that church authority should come from the bottom up and that the church should alleviate suffering, not merely accept it. Both of these religious principles are based on populism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.pt/books?id=by1AxqGkRfoC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Lamennais+church+authority+populism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eERsLcoBle&amp;sig=g3Veb6obV98g-bLwJ6cYGM4r_gI&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ei=I_wTS_igLJee_Ab5kvk1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Origins of liberal dominance: state, church, and party in nineteenth-century Europe, Andrew Gould]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==

Populism has been an important force in Latin American political history, where many [[charismatic leader]]s have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century, as the paramountcy of agrarian oligarchies had been dislocated by the onset of industrial capitalism, allowing for the emergence of an industrial bourgeoisie and the activation of an urban working class,&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo A. O'Donnell, ''Bureaucratic authoritarianism: Argentina, 1966–1973, in comparative perspective''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988, ISBN 0-520-04260-3, pages 9/10&lt;/ref&gt; causing the emergence of reformist and multi-class nationalist politics, centered on a charismatic leadership,&lt;ref&gt;John D. French, ''The Brazilian workers' ABC: class conflict and alliances in modern São Paulo''. University of North Carolina Press, 1992, ISBN 0-8078-4368-7, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana|Aprismo]] in [[Peru]], the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement|MNR]] in [[Bolivia]], and the political movements gravitating around [[Getúlio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Perón|Perón]] in Argentina, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in Mexico, Ecuador's [[José María Velasco Ibarra|Velasco Ibarra]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur,ed. ''Fascism: A Readers' Guide : Analysis, Interpretations, Bibliography''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978, ISBN 0-520-03642-5, page 255&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologically, Latin American populism, with its emphasis on nation-building under an authoritarian leadership as a prerequisite for technological modernization, betrayed the earlier influence of [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] [[positivism]]. Socially, for many authors—such as Brazil's [[Octavio Ianni]]—populism should be understood as the political alliance between an emerging industrial bourgeoisie and a newly organizing urban working class, in which the former accepts social reforming for the latter's sake as long as the working class remains politically subordinated to both a more or less authoritarian State and private enterprise,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Torres Quintero &amp; Rafael Quintero López, ''El mito del populismo: análisis de los fundamentos del Estado ecuatoriano''.Quito: Universidad Central del Ecuador, 1980, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; in a process of controlled inclusion of the &quot;masses&quot; into the political system,&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Uğur &amp; Nergis Canefe, eds., ''Turkey and European integration: accession prospects and issues''. London, Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0-415-32656-7, page 51&lt;/ref&gt; a co-opting process some Marxist authors like Brazil's [[Francisco Weffort]] ascertain was accepted by the newly urbanized working class given their lack of a previously developed class consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Aggio, Agnaldo de Sousa Barbosa, Hercídia Mara Facuri Coelho Lambert, ''Política e sociedade no Brasil, 1930–1964''. São Paulo: Anna Blume, 2002, ISBN 85-7419-242-2, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts to charter an ideological pedigree to Populism in Latin America, as has been attempted by some, working, e.g., with concepts taken from [[Peronism|Perón's Third Position]].,&lt;ref&gt;[links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-3816(195311)15%3A4%3C582%3APA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23]&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American countries have not always had a clear and consistent political ideology under populism. Populist practitioners and movements in Latin America usually adapt politically to the prevailing mood of the nation, moving within the ideological spectrum from left to right many times during their political lives. If populist movements in 1930s and 1940s Latin America had apparent fascist overtones and based themselves on authoritarian politics, as was the case of Vargas' ''Estado Novo'' dictatorship in Brazil (1937–1945),&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Rodríguez Araujo, ''Derechas y ultraderechas en el mundo''. Mexico: Siglo XXI, 2004, ISBN 968-23-2519-6, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; or of some of Peron's openly expressed sympathies,&lt;ref&gt;Íñigo Bolinaga, ''Breve historia del fascismo''. Madrid: Nowtilus, 2008, ISBN 978-84-9763-452-6, page 242&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s populism adapted—not without considerable unease from its political leadership&lt;ref&gt;In 1952, viz., Vargas' Labor Minister in Brazil saw his tasks in fervently anticommunist terms: to battle ideologies opposed to &quot;traditions&quot; of social peace—John D. French, ''Drowning in laws: labor law and Brazilian political culture''. University of North Carolina Press, 2004, ISBN 0-8078-5527-8, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;—to heightened levels of working-class mobilization. Therefore the fact that 1960s populism was associated mainly with radical, left-leaning petty-bourgeois nationalism, which emptied the State of its function as a coercive [[class (social)|class]]-rule apparatus and saw it instead as an organ of representation of the Nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Weffort, ''O populismo na política brasileira''. Rio de Janeiro:Paz e Terra, 1978, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case, for instance, of the [[João Goulart|Goulart]] government (1961–1964) in Brazil, Goulart being  described as a fiery populist who identified—mainly rhetorically—with the dispossessed and tried to foster a reformist agenda through ties to the organized Left.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Rabe, ''The most dangerous area in the world: John F. Kennedy confronts Communist Revolution in Latin America''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999, ISBN 0-8078-4764-X, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Goulart was eventually ousted by the military points, in the views of some authors, to the fact that he, as well as other populist leaders of the time, faced a jeopardy: they were reformists who, in the pursuit of their agenda, had to encourage popular mobilization and class conflict they ultimately abhorred.&lt;ref&gt;John D. French, ''The Brazilian workers' ABC: class conflict and alliances in modern São Paulo'', page 262&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the fact that populism was eventually identified by the 1970s military dictatorships as &quot;demagogery&quot; and as a risk to the stability of the existing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Lassiter,ed., ''Economics, politics and social issues in Latin America''. New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2007, ISBN 978-1-60021-182-9, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

If &quot;left&quot;, reformist and nationalist populism never died out altogether during the 1970s Latin American military dictatorships—as offered proof by the prompt and successful return of a populist like Brazil's [[Leonel Brizola]] to electoral politics in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Skidmore, ''The Politics of Military Rule in Brazil, 1964–1985''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 1989, ISBN 0-19-506316-3, page 265&lt;/ref&gt;—a different streak of populism appeared in the post-military dictatorship era.This 1980s populism, in the persons of leaders like Argentina's [[Carlos Menem]] or Brazil's [[Fernando Collor]], adapted itself to prevailing [[neoliberal]] policies of economic adjustment, setting aside nationalistic reforms and retaining the need for charismatic leadership policies, mass support and a concern for the plight of the &quot;common people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jolle Demmers, Alex E. Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom, eds. ''Miraculous metamorphoses: the neoliberalization of Latin American populism''.

In some countries, Populism has been fiscally supported in Latin America during periods of growth such as the 1950s and 1960s and during commodity price booms such as in oil and [[precious metals]]. Political leaders could gather followers among the popular classes with broad redistributive programs during these boom times. Conversely, in others countries, Populism has been historically associated with countering the relative decline of export agriculture with [[deficit spending]] and [[import-substitution]] policies aimed at developing an internal market for industrial consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz Renato Vieira, ''Consagrados e malditos: os intelectuais e a Editora Civilização Brasileira''. Brasília: Thsaurus, 1998, ISBN 85-7062-139-6, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; Populism in Latin America has been sometimes criticized for the fiscal policies of many of its leaders, but has also been defended for having allowed historically weak states to alleviate disorder and achieve a tolerable degree of stability while initiating large-scale [[industrialization]]. Though populist fiscal and monetary policies may be criticized by conservative economic historians and policy makers, who seem in it the ultimately dysfunctional subordination of economic policy to political goals,&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Dornbusch &amp; Sebastian Edwards, eds. ''The Macroeconomics of populism in Latin America''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991, ISBN 0-226-15844-6, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; some authors acknowledge populism to have allowed non-radical leaders and parties to co-opt the radical ideas of the masses so as to redirect them in a non revolutionary direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/col/000094/003357.html Populist Policies In The Transition To Democracy, Daniel Mejía and Carlos Esteban Posada]&lt;/ref&gt;—something that would exclude from the spectrum of &quot;populism&quot; governments committed to the social revolution blueprint, such as [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]'s [[Unidad Popular]] government in Chile and [[Daniel Ortega|Ortega]]'s first revolutionary government in Nicaragua. It's generally regarded that populists hope &quot;to reform the system, not to overthrow it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Dornbusch &amp; Sebastian Edwards, eds. ''The Macroeconomics of populism in Latin America'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often adapting a nationalist vocabulary and rhetorically convincing, populism was used to appeal to broad masses while remaining ideologically ambivalent. Notwithstanding, there have been notable exceptions. 21st century Latin-American populist leaders have had a decidedly—even if mostly rhetorical&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery R Webber,&quot;Venezuela under Chávez: The Prospects and Limitations of Twenty-First Century Socialism, 1999–2009&quot;, ''Études socialistes'', Vol 6, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;—socialist bent.&lt;ref name=&quot;re-public.gr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ehistory.osu.edu&quot;/&gt;

When populists take strong positions on economic philosophies such as [[capitalism]] versus socialism, the position sparks strong emotional responses regarding how best to manage the nation's current and future social and economic position. [[Mexican general election, 2006|Mexico's 2006 Presidential election]] was hotly debated among supporters and opponents of populist candidate [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_39175.cfm January 24, 2007: Mexican Political Polarization Limited to Elites Despite Contested Election], APSA Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inequality===
Populism in Latin American countries has both an economic and an ideological edge. Populism in Latin America has mostly addressed the problem, not of capitalist economic development as such but its ''inclusiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch &amp; Edwards, ''The Macroeconomics of populism in Latin America'', page 1&lt;/ref&gt; in the backdrop of highly unequal societies in which people are divided between a relative few wealthy groups and masses of poor, even in the case of societies such as [[Argentina]], where strong and educated middle classes are a significant segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacc.fiu.edu/events_outreach/fulbright/project_06.pdf CURRENT ECONOMIC ISSUES IN ARGENTINA A TEACHING MODULE], Z.

Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55238-209-7{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; In appealing to the masses of poor people prior to gaining power, populists may promise widely-demanded food, housing, employment, basic social services, and income redistribution. Once in political power, they may not always be financially or politically able to fulfill all these promises. However, they are very often successful in providing many broad and basic services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB943.pdf DEALING WITH POLITICAL FERMENT IN LATIN AMERICA: THE POPULIST REVIVAL, THE EMERGENCE OF THE CENTER, AND IMPLICATIONS OR U.S. POLICY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focal.ca/pdf/VT_The_Impact_of_Populism.pdf The Impact of &quot;Populism&quot; on Social, Political, and Economic Development in the Hemisphere, Vladimir Torres]&lt;/ref&gt;

===US policy===
Since one of the ideological hallmarks of Latin American populism was the empowerment of the ''national'' and its identification with the state,&lt;ref&gt;James M. Malloy, ed. ''Authoritarianism and corporatism in Latin America''. University of Pittsburgh Press, 1977, ISBN 0-8229-5275-0, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; including [[nationalization]] of the land, natural resources and key industries as common practice,&lt;ref&gt;Víctor Alba, ''Historia del movimiento obrero en America latina''. Eng. trans., Stanford: University of Stanford Press, 1968, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; it was seen almost from the start by American policy makers to offer a challenge to US [[hegemony]] over the Americas. The US has intervened in Latin American governments on many occasions where populism was seen threatening its interests: the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], when the populist [[Jacobo Arbenz|Arbenz]] government was overthrown by a coup backed by the American company United Fruit and the American ambassador in 1954, and the support given by the US to the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]]&lt;ref&gt;Brian Loveman, ''For la Patria: politics and the armed forces in Latin America''. Wilmington: Scholary Resources, Inc., 1999, ISBN 0-8420-2773-4, page 186&lt;/ref&gt; are just two cases of American intervention. Another example of US intervention has been seen in [[Colombia]], particularly since the assassination of the populist leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] in April 1948. Gaitán supported land reform and other populist initiatives, and his murder is assumed to have foreclosed subsequent development of populism in mainstream Colombian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Neville, ed., ''The human condition''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2002, ISBN 0-7914-5346-4, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Populist &quot;socialism&quot;===
{{POV|date=June 2012}}
Populism has remained a significant force in Latin America. Populism has recently been reappearing on the left with promises of far-reaching socialist changes as seen in Venezuela under [[Hugo Chávez]], and in Bolivia under [[Evo Morales]]- a process, however, seen by some as contradictory in that it tries to meld the populist traditional celebration of folk wisdom and charismatic leadership with doctrinaire socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Andrew Hawkins, ''Venezuela's Chavismo and Populism in Comparative Perspective''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-521-76503-9, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; And, in fact, &quot;socialist&quot; changes in today's Venezuela have mostly included the expenditure of oil revenue to benefit the working poor as a form of social welfare to help enable an eventual (and imprecise) socialist transformation. For some authors, as far as ideology is concerned, Chávez's political blueprint is more of a &quot;throwback&quot; to traditional populist nationalism and redistributivism.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Ellner &amp; Daniel Hellinger, eds., ''Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict''. Boulder: Lyne Rienner, 2003, ISBN 1-58826-297-9, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;  The Venezuelan government often spars verbally with the United States and accuses it of attempting to overthrow Chavez after supporting a failed [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt|coup]] against him. Chavez has been one of the most outspoken and blunt critics of U.S. foreign policy. Nevertheless, a large commodity trade continues between Venezuela and the U.S. because of the economic constraints of oil delivery and the proximity of the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6214533.stm Venezuela-US trade under the microscope, By Greg Morsbach]&lt;/ref&gt;

As populist tradition ascertains the paramountcy of the &quot;people&quot; (instead of class) as a political subject,&lt;ref&gt;Carlos De La Torre, ''Populist Seduction in Latin America'', 2nd. Edition. Ohio University, 2010,  ISBN 978-0-89680-279-7, page xii&lt;/ref&gt; it suffices to say that, in the 21st century, the large numbers of voters living in extreme poverty in Latin America has remained a bastion of support for new populist candidates. By early 2008 governments with varying forms of populism and with some form of left leaning (albeit vague)[[social democratic]] or [[democratic socialist]] platform had come to dominate virtually all Latin American nations with the exceptions of Colombia, El Salvador and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24244610/ More leftist leaders in Latin America – Americas – MSNBC.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This political shift includes both more developed nations such as Argentina's [[Front for Victory]] and Chile with its [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], and smaller income countries like Bolívia with its [[Movement towards Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement towards Socialism]] and Paraguay with the [[Patriotic Alliance for Change]]. Even in middle-income Mexico, a populist candidate like López Obrador, albeit defeated, nevertheless appeared as part of a strong neopopulist reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Mainwaring &amp;Timothy Scully, eds., ''Democratic Governance in Latin America''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-8047-6084-3, page 254&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, populist candidates have been more successful in poorer Latin American countries such as Bolivia (under [[Evo Morales|Morales]]), Ecuador (under [[Rafael Correa|Correa]]) and Nicaragua (under [[Daniel Ortega|Ortega]]). By the use of broad grassroots movements populist groups have managed to gain power from better organized, funded and entrenched groups such as the Bolivian [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] and the Paraguayan [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24244610/ Latin America gets another leftist leader Fernando Lugo's victory in Paraguay adds to the leftward tilt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In Mexico, [[Andres Manuel López Obrador]]'s candidacy sparked very emotional debates throughout the country regarding policies that affect ideology, class, equality, wealth, and society. Andres Manuel López Obrador's most controversial economic policies included his promise to expand monthly stipends to the poor and elderly from Mexico City to the rest of the country and to re-negotiate the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] to protect the Mexican poor.

The ruling party in Mexico, the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN), portrayed him as a danger to Mexico's hard-earned economic stability. In criticizing his redistributive promises that would create new entitlement programs somewhat similar to social security in the US (though not as broad in scope) and his trade policies that would not fully uphold prior agreements (such as NAFTA), the economic debate between capitalists and socialists became a major part of the debate. [[Felipe Calderón]], the PAN candidate, portrayed himself as not just a standard-bearer for recent economic policy, but as a more proactive candidate, to distance himself from the main criticisms of his predecessor [[Vicente Fox]] regarding inaction. He labeled himself the &quot;jobs president&quot; and promised greater national wealth for all through steady future growth, fiscal prudence, international trade, and balanced government spending.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

During the immediate aftermath of the tight elections in which the country's electoral court was hearing challenges to the vote tally that had Calderon winning, López Obrador showed the considerable influence over the masses that are a trademark of populist politicians. He effectively led huge demonstrations, filling the central plaza with masses of sympathizers who supported his challenge. The demonstrations lasted for several months and eventually dissipated after the electoral court did not find sufficient cause from the challenges presented to overturn the results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dogbrothers.com/phpBB2/index.php?topic=604.50 Dog Brothers Public Forum, Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Closely Fought Elections, Whitehead, Laurence Project MUSE – Journal of Democracy, Volume 18, Number 2, April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several versions of a populist party in the United States, some inspired by the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party of the 1890s]]. This was the party of the early U.S. populist movement in which millions of farmers and other working people successfully enacted their anti-trust agenda.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Other early populist political parties in the United States included the [[United States Greenback Party|Greenback Party]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party of 1912]] led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party of 1924]] led by [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and the [[Share Our Wealth]] movement of [[Huey Long]] in 1933–35{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

[[George Wallace]], Four-Term Governor of Alabama, led a populist movement that carried five states and won 13.5% of the popular vote in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]]. Campaigning against intellectuals and liberal reformers, Wallace gained a large share of the white working class vote in Democratic primaries in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.pt/books?id=5aoVyB_BEIQC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22George+Wallace+white+working+class+1972%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIviiFHjIz&amp;sig=wrJnhuBKIMjZjy0UWOP6cFHuYgA&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ei=vX6RSuriD-OMjAe9zZX8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Behind the backlash: white working-class politics in Baltimore, 1940–1980 Por Kenneth D.

Populism continues to be a force in modern U.S. politics, especially in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996]] third-party presidential campaigns of billionaire [[Ross Perot]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. The 1996, [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]], and the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]] presidential campaigns of [[Ralph Nader]] had a strong populist cast{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

Dennis Kuchinich&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al Sharpton]] also had populist elements. The 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] has been described by many&lt;ref name=&quot;peterlevine.ws&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterlevine.ws/mt/archives/2007_02.html February 7, 2007, three forms of populism in the 2008 campaign (scroll down)]&lt;/ref&gt; (and by himself) as a &quot;one economic community, one commonwealth&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;peterlevine.ws&quot;/&gt; populist.

Comparison between earlier surges of populism and those of today are complicated by shifts in what are thought to be the interests of the common people.

In 1984, the [[Populist Party (US)|Populist Party]] name was revived by [[Willis Carto]], and was used in [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]] as a vehicle for the presidential campaign of former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader, and later member of both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], [[David Duke]]. Right-wing [[Patriot movement]] organizer [[Bo Gritz]] was briefly Duke's running mate. This incarnation of populism was widely regarded as a vehicle for white supremacist recruitment. In this instance, populism was maligned by the use of a definition of &quot;the people&quot; that was not the prevailing definition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Another populist mechanism was the initiative and referendum driven term limits movement of the early 1990s. In every state where term limits were on the ballot, the measure to limit incumbency in Congress passed. The average vote was 67% in favor. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down term limits in 1995 in the court case [[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-835209.html Congressional Term Limits Struck Down; Supreme Court's 5–4 Ruling Upsets Laws in 23 States, Joan Biskupic, The Washington Post, May 23, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]] (RPUSA) was organized after the populist presidential campaign of Ross Perot in 1992. In the year 2000, an intense fight for the presidential nomination made [[Patrick J. Buchanan]] the RPUSA standard bearer. As result of his nomination as party candidate there were many party splits, not only from Buchanan supporters after he left the party, but also moderates, progressivists and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] around [[Jesse Ventura]] who refused to collaborate with the Buchanan candidacy. Since then the party's fortunes have markedly declined.

In the 2000s, new populist parties were formed in America. One was the [[Populist Party of America]] in 2002; another was the [[Populist Party of Maryland]] formed to support Ralph Nader in 2004, which ran candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, U.S. Senate and state delegate in the [[United States 2006 elections|2006 elections]]. Other examples are the [[American Populist Party]], founded in 2009, and the American Populist Renaissance, founded in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupProfile&amp;groupID=101427726&amp;Mytoken=6C32D32C-FBBB-484B-967DAE7FAB3B276E5070408 American Populist Renaissance on MySpace, MySpace Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://embatk.to/apr American Populist Renaissance official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Moderation Party, also formed in 2005, adopted several populist ideals, chief among them working against multinational [[neo-corporatism]]. Much of the [[Tea Party movement]] has used populist rhetoric, particularly in areas and states where Democrats are in power. For instance, in [[New York]], [[Carl Paladino]] and his conservative-populist [[Taxpayers Party of New York]] have used the motto &quot;Paladino for the People&quot; and have attempted to woo common people to vote for them by pitting them against the state government and the special interests that have influence in it.

In the most recent example of populist movements and the ongoing attempt to pit &quot;the people&quot; (the have-nots) against &quot;the elite&quot; (the haves), participants of the [[Occupy movement]] define themselves by the phrase [[we are the 99%]]. The Occupy leadership adopted the concept of the 1%, to refer to the Wall Street elite, who they insist are the source of systemic instability and directly responsible for undermining the social safety nets implemented during the New Deal.  Political science professors Joe Lowndes and Dorian Warren have asked, &quot;Occupy Wall Street: A Twenty-First Century Populist Movement?&quot;.  They conclude it is the &quot;first major populist movement on the U.S. left since the 1930s.&quot;  Economic issues, have returned to center stage, making more like the 1890s or 1930s than the New Left uprising of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Lowndes and Dorian Warren, ''Occupy Wall Street: A Twenty-First Century Populist Movement?''

[[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]], a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Religious minister|Minister]], a professor at the [[University of Berlin]] and the &quot;father of [[gymnastics]]&quot;, introduced the concept of [[Volkstum]], a racial notion that draws on the essence of a people that was lost in the [[Industrial Revolution]].
[[Adam Mueller]] went a step further by positing the state as a bigger totality than the government institution. This paternalistic vision of [[aristocracy]] concerned with social orders had a dark side in that the opposite force of modernity was represented by the Jews, who were said to be eating away at the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.pt/books?id=ZNVO4uOJCYQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT402&amp;lpg=RA1-PT402&amp;dq=%22Adam+M%C3%BCller+Juden%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5sk00KVqCk&amp;sig=DSQR0CZY6mgvG5zFX_d5CUX5P98&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ei=qt0TS93lDsKe_gafoeE1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus, Cornelia Schmitz-Berning]&lt;/ref&gt; Populism also played a role in mobilizing middle class support for the Nazi Party in Weimar Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Fritzsche 1990: 149–150, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, distressed middle–class populists during the pre-Nazi Weimar period mobilized their anger at government and big business. According to Fritzsche:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Nazis expressed the populist yearnings of middle–class constituents and at the same time advocated a strong and resolutely anti-Marxist mobilization.... Against &quot;unnaturally&quot; divisive parties and querulous organized interest groups, [[National Socialists]] cast themselves as representatives of the commonwealth, of an allegedly betrayed and neglected German public....[b]reaking social barriers of status and [[caste]], and celebrating at least rhetorically the populist ideal of the people's community...&lt;ref name=&quot;Fritzsche 1990: 233-235&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==France==
In the late 18th century, the [[French Revolution]], though led by wealthy intellectuals, could also be described as a manifestation of populist sentiment against the elitist excesses and privileges of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alain.laurent-faucon.over-blog.com&quot;&gt;[http://alain.laurent-faucon.over-blog.com/categorie-10222763.html SYNTHÈSE : LE PEUPLE !

In France, the populist and nationalist picture was more [[mysticism|mystical]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and literarian in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/27584836 Le mythe du peuple et la société française du XIXe siècle], [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Jules Michelet]] (sometimes called a populist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1996/04/HALIMI/2661 Le populisme, voilà l’ennemi !], April 1996, [[Le Monde diplomatique]]&lt;/ref&gt;) fused nationalism and populism by positing the people as a mystical unity who are the driving force of history in which the [[divinity]] finds its purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;alain.laurent-faucon.over-blog.com&quot;/&gt; Michelet viewed history as a representation of the struggle between spirit and matter; he claims  France has a special place because the French became a people through [[social equality|equality]], [[Freedom (political)|liberty]], and [[fraternity]]. Because of this, he believed, the French people can never be wrong. Michelet's ideas are not [[socialism]] or rational politics, and his populism always minimizes, or even masks, social class differences.
