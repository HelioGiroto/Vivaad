Following the collapse of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[African American]]s created a broad-based independent political movement in the South: '''Black Populism'''.&lt;ref&gt;See Omar H. Ali, ''In the Balance of Power: Independent Black Politics and Third Party Movements in the United States'' (Athens: [[Ohio University Press]], 2008), Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

Between 1886 and 1898 Black farmers, [[sharecropper]]s, and agrarian laborers organized their communities to combat the rising tide of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] laws. As Black Populism asserted itself and grew into a regional force, it met fierce resistance from the white planter and business elite that, through the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated network of courts, militias, sheriffs, and newspapers, maintained tight control of the region. Violence against Black Populism was organized through the [[Ku Klux Klan]], among other white terrorist organizations designed to halt or reverse the advance of black civil and political rights.

==Goals==

Despite opposition, Black Populists carried out a wide range of activities:

*Establishing farming exchanges
*Raising money for schools
*Publishing newspapers
*Lobbying for better legislation
*Mounting boycotts against agricultural trusts
*Carrying out strikes for better wages
*Protesting the convict-lease system and lynching
*Demanding Black jurors in cases involving black defendants
*Promoting local political reforms and federal supervision of elections
*Running independent and fusion campaigns.

Black Populism found early expression in various agrarian organizations, including the [[Colored Agricultural Wheels]], the southern [[Knights of Labor]], the [[Cooperative Workers of America]], and the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers' Alliance]]. However, facing the limitations in attempting to implement their reforms absent of engaging the electoral process, Black Populists helped to launch the [[People’s Party]] and used the then left-of-centre [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in fusion campaigns. (Today though, after the Republican Party moved to the right, and the Democratic Party in the South was abandoned by the White Populist [[Dixiecrats]] who had opposed integration in the 1960s, most African Americans who vote cast ballots for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates).

==Resistance and failure==

By the late 1890s, under relentless attack – propaganda campaigns warning of a “second Reconstruction” and “Negro rule,” physical intimidation, violence, and assassinations of leaders and foot soldiers – the movement was crushed. A key figure in the attack on Black Populism was [[Ben Tillman]], the leader of [[South Carolina]]'s white farmers' movement. As realistic politicians, the Southern Populist knew that they had only two possible alternatives in the fight against the ruling [[Bourbon Democrat]]s. They must choose between trying to win the Negro votes or working to eliminate it entirely. The Tillman group in South Carolina sought the latter method. They were completely reactionary on the Negro question and stood with the Bourbons in disregarding the principles of the Fifteenth Amendment. Elsewhere the populists sought to win Negro votes, either through fusion with the Republican minority or through the raising of issues with a broad appeal to the Negro farmers.It was no accident that in the South the third-party movement was strongest in those states where it sought not only Negro votes but active Negro support.&lt;ref&gt;Rochester, Anna. ''The Populist Movement in the United States''. International Publishers,New York, 1943, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that the black man had somehow betrayed Populism would constantly haunt the Georgia People's Party from the very beginning Populists had realized the political importance of blacks. Of the state's forty thousand Republicans voters, a considerable majority were former bondsmen. If the white votes were to split, they might decide the outcome of any state election. But therein lay a predicament. How were Populists to court the black votes without losing the whites? How were they to keep whites form thinking of them the &quot;nigger party,&quot; The party willing to truckle to the former slaves? Clearly, however, an attempt had to be made to win over blacks. It was dangerous scheme, but it contained a degree of precedent of in state politics. In the 1870s and 1880s, democrats and independents had sometimes used the same device when the white votes splits. In those days many whites where willing to allow the black man the ballot, specially when it could be sometimes bought for as little as a dime or a mouthful of whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;Barton,C Shaw. ''The Wool-Hat Boys- Georgia's Populist Party''. Louisiana State University Press, 1947, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Populism was destroyed, marking the end of organized political resistance to the return of [[White supremacy]] in the South in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, Black Populism stands as the largest independent political uprising in the South until the modern [[Civil Rights]] movement.
