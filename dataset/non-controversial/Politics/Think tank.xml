A '''think tank''' (or '''policy institute''') is an [[organization]] that conducts [[research]] and engages in [[advocacy]] in areas such as [[social policy]], political strategy, economics, military, technology issues, and in the creative and cultural field.  Most think tanks are [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] organizations, which some countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] provide with [[Tax exemption|tax exempt]] status. Other think tanks are funded by governments, [[advocacy group]]s, or businesses, or derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Stone 'Think Tanks and Policy Analysis', in Frank Fischer, Gerald J. Miller. &amp; Mara S. Sidney (eds.) Handbook of Public Policy Analysis: Theory, Methods, and Politics, New York, Marcel Dekker Inc. 2006: 149–157&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following article lists global think tanks according to continental categories, and then sub-categories by country within those areas. These listings are not comprehensive, given that more than 4,500 think tanks exist world wide. In general, this article is an introduction to the think tank landscape, and provides a way to quickly navigate to those of interest.

==History==
While the term  &quot;think tank&quot; originated in the 1950s,{{citation_needed|date=August 2012}} such organizations date to the 19th century. The Institute for Defence and Security Studies ([[RUSI]]) was founded in 1831 in [[London]]. The [[Fabian Society]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] dates from 1884. The [[Brookings Institution]] began in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1916.

After 1945, the number of think tanks grew, as many smaller new think tanks were formed to express various issue and policy agendas. Until the 1940s, most think tanks were known only by the name of the institution. During the Second World War, think tanks were referred to as &quot;brain boxes&quot; after the slang term for the skull. The phrase &quot;think tank&quot; in wartime American slang referred to rooms where strategists discussed war planning. The term think tank itself, however, originally referred to organizations that offered military advice—most notably the [[RAND Corporation]], founded originally in 1946 as an offshoot of [[Douglas Aircraft]], and which became an independent corporation in 1948.

For most of the 20th century, independent public policy think tanks that performed research and provided advice on public policy were an organizational phenomenon found primarily in the United States, with a much smaller number in [[Canada]] and Western Europe. Although think tanks existed in Japan for some time, they generally lacked independence, having close ties to government ministries or corporations. There has been a veritable proliferation of &quot;think tanks&quot; around the world that began in the 1980s as a result of the forces of globalization, the end of the Cold War, and the emergence of transnational problems. Two-thirds of all the think tanks that exist today were established after 1970 and over half were established since 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=James|title=Think Tanks and the Transnationalization of Foreign Policy|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/thinktanks.20021216.mcgann.transnationalforeignpolicy.html|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of globalization on the think tank movement is most evident in regions such as Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia, where there was a concerted effort by the international community to support the creation of independent public policy research organizations. A recent survey conducted by the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program underscores the significance of this effort and documents the fact that most of the think tanks in these regions have been established in the last 10 years. Today there are over 4,500 of these institutions around the world. Many of the more established think tanks, having been created during the Cold War, are focused on international affairs, security studies, and foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGann&quot;/&gt;

Also see the [[United Nations Development Programme]] definition.

==Types==
Think tanks vary by ideological perspectives, sources of funding, issue focus and prospective audience.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Washington's Think Tanks: Factories to Call Our Own|url=http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2010/0813_think_tanks_singer.aspx|publisher=the Brookings Institution|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some think tanks, such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], which promotes conservative principles, and the [[Center for American Progress]] on the progressive front, are more partisan in purpose. Others, including the [[Tellus Institute]], which focuses on social and environmental topics, are more issue-oriented groups. Still others, such as the [[Cato Institute]], promote libertarian social and economic theories based on [[Friedrich von Hayek]]'s idea of free markets and individual liberty.

Funding sources and the targeted audiences also define the workings of think tanks. Some receive direct government support, while others rely on private individual or corporate donors.  This will invariably affect the levels of academic freedom within each think tank and to whom or what the institution feels beholden. Funding may also reflect who or what the institution wants to influence; in the United States, for example, &quot;Some donors want to influence votes in Congress or shape public opinion, others want to position themselves or the experts they fund for future government jobs, while others want to push specific areas of research or education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot; /&gt;

A new trend, resulting from [[globalization]], is collaboration between think tanks across continents. For instance, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] operates offices in Washington, D.C., Beijing, Beirut, Brussels and Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot; /&gt;

The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP) at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] annually rates think tanks worldwide in a number of categories and presents its findings in the &quot;Global Go-To Think Tanks&quot; rating index.&lt;ref name=&quot;Go-To Think Tanks 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=James|title=The Global &quot;Go-To Think Tanks&quot;|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2010.pdf|publisher=the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this approach to the study and assessment of think tanks has been criticised by think tank researchers such as Enrique Mendizabal and Goran Buldioski, Director of the Think Tank Fund, supported by the Open Society Institute.&lt;ref name=Mendizabal&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendizabal|first=Enrique|title=Another year, another ranking of think tanks (and surprise surprise, Brookings is still the best)|url=http://onthinktanks.org/2011/01/21/another-year-another-ranking-of-think-tanks-and-surprise-surprise-brookings-is-still-the-best/|publisher=On Think Tanks|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buldioski&gt;{{cite web|last=Buldioski|first=Goran|title=Mirror, mirror on the wall… tell me who is the best think tank in the world?|url=http://goranspolicy.com/mirror-mirror-wall-tank-world/|publisher=Goran's Musings|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have outlined a number of different ways of describing think tanks in a way that takes into account regional and national variations. For example from Diane Stone [http://www.adbi.org/discussion-paper/2005/09/09/1356.think.tanks/think.tanks.definitions.development.and.diversification/ Diane Stone (2005)]:

* [[Political party]] think tanks and legacy or personal think tanks
* Global (or regional) think tanks (with some of the above)

Alternatively, one could use some of the following criteria:

==Functional approach in Latin America==
Research done by Enrique Mendizabal&lt;ref&gt;Mendizabal Enrique (2009) Think tanks and political parties in Latin America, Background Paper: http://www.odi.org.uk/events/2009/03/10/443-think-tanks-political-parties.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; shows that Latin American think tanks play various roles depending on their origins, historical development and relations to other policy actors. In this study, Orazio Bellettini from [[Grupo FARO]] suggests that they:&lt;ref&gt;Mendizabal, Enrique y Kristen Sample (eds) (2009) Dime a quien escuchas... Think Tanks y Partidos Politicos en America Latina, ODI/IDEA: Lima&lt;/ref&gt;

# Seek political support for policies.
# Legitimize policies – This has been clearer in [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. New governments in Ecuador and Peru have approached think tanks for support for already defined policies. In Bolivia, the government led by [[Evo Morales]] has been working with [[NGO]]s and other research centres to do the same. However, in the Chilean context, many think tanks during the 1990s appeared to support and maintain the legitimacy of policies implemented during the previous decade by the dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]].
# Spaces of debate – In this case think tanks serve as sounding boards for new policies. In [[Chile]], during the Pinochet dictatorship, many left wing intellectuals and researchers found ‘asylum’ in think tanks. In Ecuador, think tanks are seen as spaces where politicians can test the soundness of their policies and government plans.
# Financial channels for political parties or other interest groups – In Ecuador and Bolivia, German foundations have been able to provide funds to think tanks that work with certain political parties. This approach has provided support to the system as a whole rather than individual CSOs.
# Expert cadres of policy-makers and politicians – In Peru after the fall of the [[Alberto Fujimori|Fujimori]] regime, and in Chile after the fall of Pinochet, think tank staff left to form part of the new governments. In the U.S., the role of leading think tanks is precisely that: host scholars for a few months or years and then see them off to work in policy.

How a think tank addresses these largely depends on how they work, their ideology vs. evidence credentials, and the context they operate in (including funding opportunities, the degree and type of competition they face, their staff, etc.).

This functional approach addresses the inherit challenge of defining a think tank. As Simon James aptly noted in 1998, &quot;Discussion of think tanks...has a tendency to get bogged down in the vexed question of defining what we mean by ‘think tank’—an exercise that often degenerates into futile semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/A2A2BA10-B135-DE11-AFAC-001CC477EC70/ |title=&quot;Think Tanks as an Emergent Field&quot; — Publication — Social Science Research Council |publisher=Ssrc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is better (as in the Network Functions Approach) to describe what the organisation should do. Then the shape of the organisation should follow to allow this to happen. The following framework (based on Stephen Yeo’s description of think tanks’ mode of work) is described in Enrique Mendizabal's blog &quot;onthinktanks&quot;:

First, think tanks may work in or based their funding on one or more ways, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onthinktanks.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/on-the-business-model/ |title=on the business model and how this affects what think tanks do « on think tanks |publisher=Onthinktanks.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Independent research: this would be work done with core or flexible funding that allows the researchers the liberty to choose their research questions and method. It may be long term and could focus on ‘big ideas’ with no direct policy relevance.  On the other hand, it could focus on a key policy problem that requires a thorough research and action investment.
# Consultancy: this would be work done through commissions with specific clients and addressing one or two key questions. Consultancies often respond to an existing agenda.
# Influencing/advocacy: this would be work done through communications, capacity development, networking, campaigns, lobbying, etc. It is likely to be based on research based evidence emerging from independent research or consultancies.

Second, think tanks may base their work or arguments on:

# Ideology, values or interests
# Applied, empirical or synthesis research
# Theoretical or academic research

According to the [[National Institute for Research Advancement]], a Japanese think tank, think tanks are &quot;one of the main policy actors in democratic societies ..., assuring a pluralistic, open and accountable process of policy analysis, research, decision-making and evaluation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/nwdtt/2005/intro/intro2002.html &quot;Introduction&quot;] NIRA's World Directory of Think Tanks 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A study in early 2009 found a total of 5,465 think tanks worldwide. Of that number, 1,777 were based in the United States and approximately 350 in Washington DC alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4598&amp;page=0 |title=Foreign Policy, January/February, 2009 |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In some cases, corporate interests have found it useful to create &quot;think tanks.&quot;  For example, [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] was formed in the mid 1990s to dispute research finding a link between [[second-hand smoke]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tobaccoscam.ucsf.edu/pdf/9.6-Ong%26Glantz-JunkScience.pdf |title=Constructing &quot;Sound Science&quot; and &quot;Good Epidemiology&quot;: Tobacco, Lawyers, and Public Relations Firms |publisher=American Public Health Association |first1=Elisa K. |last1=Ong |first2=Stanton A. |last2=Glantz |year=2001 |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1749–1757 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |accessdate=2011-11-29 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1749 |pmid=11684593 |pmc=1446868}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an internal memo from [[Philip Morris Companies|Philip Morris]] referring to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), &quot;the credibility of the EPA is defeatable, but not on the basis of ETS ([[environmental tobacco smoke]]) alone. It must be part of a larger mosaic that concentrates all the EPA's enemies against it at one time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2000Q3/junkman.html |title=How Big Tobacco Helped Create &quot;the Junkman&quot; &amp;#124; Center for Media and Democracy |publisher=Prwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the left-wing [[non-government organization]] Fair.org, right-wing think tanks are often quoted and rarely labeled. The result is that sometimes think tank &quot;experts&quot; are depicted as neutral sources without any ideological predispositions when, in fact, they represent a particular perspective.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1425, http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3322&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of education, think tank publications are subjected to expert review by the [[National Education Policy Center|National Education Policy Center's]] &quot;Think Twice&quot; think tank review project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/think-tank-review-project |title=Think Tank Review Project &amp;#124; National Education Policy Center |publisher=Nepc.colorado.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A think tank is often a &quot;[[tank]]&quot;, in the intellectual sense: discussion only in a closed circle protected from outside influence isolates the participants, subjects them to several cognitive biases ([[groupthink]], [[confirmation bias]]) and fosters members' existing beliefs. This leads to surprisingly radical and even unfeasible ideas being published. Many think tanks, however, purposefully attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting members from diverse backgrounds.

==Asian think tanks==

===Bangladesh===
In the People's Republic of [[Bangladesh]] a number of think tanks are working on foreign policy and security issues. Most of these are based in [[Dhaka]]. Among the think tanks set up by the [[Government of Bangladesh|government]], Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) stands as one of the prime organizations that works to undertake and promote research and deliberation on [[International relations|international affairs]], [[security]] and developmental issues of the country. In 1984, the government of Bangladesh issued an ordinance to define organogram and objectives of the think tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biiss.org/ Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the [[People's Republic of China]] a number of think tanks are sponsored by governmental agencies, like [[Development Research Center of the State Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Fengbo Zhang#Notable Quotes|Fengbo Zhang Notable Quotes]]&lt;/ref&gt; but still retain sufficient non-official status to be able to propose and debate ideas more freely. Most of the actual [[diplomacy]] between [[China]] and the [[United States]] has taken the form of academic exchanges between members of think tanks. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In January 2012, the first non-official think-tank in China, South Non-Governmental Think-Tank, was established in Guang-Dong province.

====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, those early think tanks established in the late 1980s and early 1990s focused on the political development including first direct Legislative Council members election in 1991 and the political framework of &quot;[[One Country, Two Systems]]&quot; manifested in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. After the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997, more and more think tanks were established by various groups of intellectuals and professionals. They have various missions and objectives including promoting civic education; undertaking research on economic social and political policies; promoting &quot;public understanding of and participation in the political, economic, and social development of the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]]&quot;.

===India===
India has the third largest number of think tanks in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/18404_2010globalgotoreport-thinktankindex.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are based in New Delhi, and a few are government sponsored. A number of these work on foreign policy and security issues{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. There are few think tanks like [[Centre for Civil Society]] who promote liberal social and economic ideas and others like the Rakshak Foundation, who encourage students to do empirical research and gain first hand experience in public policy issues{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}.  [http://www.vifindia.org/ Vivekananda International Foundation] another example{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. [http://www.gatewayhouse.in/ Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations], a think tank based in Mumbai looks at the intersection of foreign policy and business - and how India's businesses are shaping India's interactions with the world.

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
Several organizations established in Iran since the late 1990s offer a unique blend of interdisciplinary research. Their focuses have been to provide social managers and policies. Andishkadeh Yaghin (CBSDA), [[Atinegaar Think Tank]], [[Nano Health Think Tank]], ASEF Think tank, [[Seywan Institute]], and Sharif Think tank &amp; Polytechnic Think Tank are some famous Think tanks in this region. Think tank is called &quot;Andishkadeh&quot; in the [[Persian language]].

===Japan===
Japan has over 100 think tanks, most of which cover not only policy research but also economy, technology and so on.  Some are government related, but most of the think tanks are sponsored by the private sector.

===Republic of Korea (South Korea)===
In Korea, the National Research Council for Economics, Humanities and Social Sciences (NRCS) is a public institution that supported 23 related research institutes in their quest to achieve the effective management and improvement of their research environment under the Prime Minister. It was established with the objective of supporting and fostering research institutes in the area of economics and social science and systematically supervising them in their contributions to the production of high-quality national policy research and the development of a concrete knowledge industry. The NRCS was reorganized in 2005 through the merger of the Korea Council of Economic and Social Research Institutes and the Korea Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences established separately in 1999.

The Center for Free Enterprise (Korea) is a free market think tank located in Seoul, South Korea, with pages in English and Korean.

===Malaysia===
Most Malaysia think tanks are government or political party related. They focus on defence, politicsm and policies. Notable ones include the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), Malaysian Strategic Research Centre (MSRC), [http://www.iais.org.my/en/ International Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies (IAIS) Malaysia], [[IDEAS (Think Tank)|Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs]] (IDEAS), Maritime Institute of Malaysia (MIMA) and [http://penanginstitute.org/v3/home/ Penang Institute (formerly Socio-economic and Environmental Research Institute (SERI))]. IDEAS is Malaysia's first policy oriented classical liberal think tank.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan's think tanks mainly revolve around internal politics, foreign security issues, and regional geo-politics. Most of these are centered around the capital, [[Islamabad]], and have been founded by former military and intelligence personnel. Most recently, institutes such as the National University of Sciences and Technology have embarked on creating industrial linkages to create think tanks focusing on industrial and economic growth issues.

Other think tanks concern religion and how its influence could grow in an already religious country. These are centred throughout the country and work under the umbrella of the mammoth Jamaat-e-Islami with headquarters in [[Lahore]] and has immense global influence, reach and regard among more traditional Muslims. However the Jamat is a political party, and affiliations with reputable think tanks in Pakistan are not clear.

There are several other think tanks as well, such as those concerning the state of education in the country, which hold many former or present educators. There are also think tanks concerning human rights, women rights, labour rights, justice, city development, heritage protection, and environmental protection, all headed by the country's urban dwelling, educated elite living, most of whom have studied or worked abroad. There remains a vacuum for former high ranking Government officials and party members to contribute to the think tank and policy advocacy process in these areas.

Some notable Pakistani think tanks are the Institute of Policy Studies, the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs,the Corporate Advisory Council (NUST)and Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).

Most are known to the general public through seminars and newspaper articles, or conducting workshops and lectures at colleges and universities.

===Republic of the Philippines===
The Institute for Strategic and Development Studies (ISDS Philippines) is an independent non-profit, policy research and advocacy institution that is also involved in training activities in cooperation with other training institutions at home and abroad. It was founded by a group of academics from the University of the Philippines Diliman in April 1991. It was established in response to the need for an ongoing evaluation and interpretation of the changes in national and international affairs by serious international, regional, and national analysts. It was also aimed at responding to the need to provide academics a venue for research to enrich teaching and to provide inputs to policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;ISDS website http://www.isdsphilippines.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIPVTR is an independent, non-stock, non-profit, non-governmental research organization officially registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 29 November 2007 as Philippine Institute for Political Violence and Terrorism Research.  It was first conceptualized in September 2005 by a group of experts, academics and practitioners who see the need to establish a center  in the Philippines dedicated to the study of political violence and terrorism and their implications for peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;PIPVTR website http://www.pipvtr.com/pipvtr/&lt;/ref&gt;

Think tanks in the Philippines could be generally categorized in terms of their linkages with the national government. Several were set up by the Philippine government for the specific purpose of providing research input into the policy-making process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nira.or.jp/past/publ/review/99winter/kraft.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka has a number of think tanks that are in the form governmental, non-governmental and corporate organizations.

The Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo is another policy planning related think tank. The International Center for Ethnic Studies (located both in Colombo and Kandy) is another research-related think tank. There are several other focus-research institutes throughout the country that may be referred to as Think Tanks, such as the Marga Institute of Sri Lanka.

Other think tanks in Sri Lanka include the Islamic Think Tank and the Sri Lanka Think Tank – UK. Many private and government universities in Sri Lanka have research-related think tanks.

In addition to specific independent think tanks, the largest political parties have their own think tank organizations. This is mainly due to support granted by state for such activity.{{by whom|date=December 2011}} The corporate world has focused their efforts to central representative organization [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]], which acts as think tank in addition to negotiating salaries with workers unions. Furthermore, there is the Finnish Business and Policy Forum (''Elinkeinoelämän valtuuskunta'', EVA). Agricultural and regional interests, associated with The Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (''Maa- ja metsätaloustuottajain Keskusliitto'', MTK) and the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], are researched by Pellervo Economic Research (''Pellervon taloustutkimus'', PTT).

===Serbia===

Serbia's best known think thank is the Foundation for the Advancement of Economics - FREN, founded in 2005 by the Belgrade University’s Faculty of Economics. Thanks to the quality and relevance of its research, FREN has established itself as one of the leading economic think tanks in Serbia. FREN's team comprises a network of over 30 associates who regularly and systematically monitor economic trends in Serbia, conduct in-depth research and encourage and facilitate the exchange of information and availability of economic data.

===Slovakia===
Besides the international think tanks present in the surrounding countries as well (with [[Open Society Foundations]] being the most notable one) Slovakia has a host of its own think tanks as well, such as [[Institute of Public Affairs]] (''Inštitút pre verejné otázky'' or ''IVO'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) and [[Forum Minority Research Institute]] (''Fórum Kisebbségkutató Intézet'' or ''Fórum Intézet'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''Fórum inštitút pre výskum menšín'' or ''Fórum inštitút'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]), with the latter concentrating on minority issues. Since most of these organizations are generally perceived to be associated with [[right-wing]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties of Slovakia (with the perception being particularly strong among Slovak [[nationalism|nationalists]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/199|title=Res publica|author=Pavel Kapusta|language=Slovak|publisher=''Extra Plus''|date=November 2008|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; findings and proposals made by these organizations are generally resented or ignored by left-wing supporters and nationalists., &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extraplus.sk/content/view/1574|title=Mesežnikovov barometer|language=Slovak|author=Ľudovít Števko|publisher=''Extra Plus''|date=August 2011|accessdate={{date|2012-05-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; k.h.

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], think tanks are progressively raising their public profile. There are now at least 30 think tanks in the country.
One of the most influential Spanish think tanks is the [[Elcano Royal Institute]], created in 2001 following the example of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in the UK, although it is closely linked to (and receives funding from) the Socialist government in power. More independent but clearly to the left of the political spectrum are the Centro de Investigaciones de Relaciones Internacionales y Desarrollo (CIDOB) founded in 1973; and the Fundación para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Diálogo Exterior (FRIDE) established in 1999 by Diego Hidalgo and main driving force behind projects such as the Club de Madrid, a group of democratic former heads of state and government, or the Foreign Policy Spanish Edition. Former Prime Minister José Maria Aznar presides over the Fundación para el Analisis y los Estudios Sociales ([[FAES]]), a policy institute that is associated with the conservative Popular Party (PP). Also linked to the PP is the Grupo de Estudios Estratégicos (GEES), which is known for its defense- and security-related research and analysis. For its part, the [[Fundación Alternativas]] is independent but close to left-wing ideas. The Socialist Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) has created a new think tank called the [http://www.fundacionideas.es/en Fundación Ideas]. More specialized think tanks has also emerged in Spain during the past 10 years, like the Future Trends Forum from [http://www.fundacionbankinter.org/en Bankinter Foundation], a unique think tank in Europe, focused on detecting social, economic, scientific and technological trends and analyzing their possible application and impact on current business models.

===Sweden===
The two biggest think tanks in Sweden is the liberal oriented [[Timbro]] and center-left oriented [[Agora]].
Others are [[Sektor3]], [[SNS]], [[FORES]], Arbetarrörelsens Tankesmedja (sociodemocratic oriented), Civitas (Christian democratic oriented) and Cogito (Green oriented).

===Turkey===
[[Turkish think tanks]] are relatively new. Many of them are sister organizations of a political party or a company. University think tanks are not typical think tanks. Most Turkish think tanks provide research and ideas, yet they play less important roles in policy making when compared with American think tanks. There are at least 20 think tanks in the country. One of the most influential and oldest Turkish think tanks is the International Strategic Research Organisation (USAK).

===Ukraine===
[[Razumkov Centre]]
Razumkov Centre is a non-governmental think tank founded in 1994. It carries out research of public policy in the following spheres:
* domestic policy;
* state administration;

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|List of think tanks in the United Kingdom}}
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], think tanks play a similar role to the [[United States]], attempting to shape policy, and indeed there is some cooperation between British and American think tanks. For example, the London-based think tank [[Chatham House]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] were both conceived at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and have remained sister organisations. 

The [[Bow Group]], founded in 1951, is the oldest centre-right think tank and many of its members have gone on to serve as Members of Parliament or Members of the European Parliament. Past chairmen have included [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Michael Howard]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s longest-serving Cabinet Minister [[Geoffrey Howe]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]] and former [[British Telecom]] chairman [[Christopher Bland]].

==United States think tanks==
{{Main|List of think tanks in the United States}}

As the classification is most often used today, the oldest American think tank is the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], founded in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Medvetz 2012&quot;&gt;Thomas Medvetz, &quot;'Think Tanks in America&quot; (2012) Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Government Research, which later merged with two organizations to form the Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution (1919), The Twentieth Century Fund (1919, and now known as the Century Foundation), the National Bureau of Economic Research (1920), and the Council on Foreign Relations. The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934) and the Committee for Economic Development (1943).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Medvetz 2012&quot;/&gt;

In collaboration with the Douglas Aircraft Company, the Air Force set up the [[RAND Corporation]] in 1946 to develop weapons technology and strategic defense analysis.

In 1971 [[Lewis F. Powell]] Jr. urged conservatives to retake command of public discourse by &quot;financing think tanks, reshaping mass media and seeking influence in universities and the judiciary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate_accountability/powell_memo_lewis.html Lewis F. Powell, &quot;Attack on the American Free Enterprise System.&quot;] 1971 memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following  decades conservative policies once considered outside the political mainstream—such as abolishing welfare, privatizing [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[deregulating]] banking, embracing [[preemptive war]]—were taken seriously and sometimes passed into law thanks to the work of the [[Hoover Institution]], [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and smaller tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Murray L. Weidenbaum, ''The Competition of Ideas: The World of the Washington Think Tanks'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Abelson, ''Do Think Tanks Matter?: Assessing the Impact of Public Policy Institutes'' (2009) pp 168–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Think tanks help shape both foreign and domestic policy. They receive  funding from private donors, and members of private organizations. Think tanks may feel more free to propose and debate controversial ideas than people within government. The liberal media watchgroup [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) has identified the top 25 think tanks by media citations, noting that from 2006 to 2007 the number of citations declined 17%.&lt;ref&gt;FAIR. [http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3322 The Incredible Shrinking Think Tank].&lt;/ref&gt; The FAIR report reveals the ideological breakdown of the citations: 37% conservative, 47% centrist, and 16% liberal. Their data show that the most-cited think tank was the [[Brookings Institution]], followed by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], and the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].

A database of articles released by these organizations can be found here: [http://www.think-bank.org The Think Bank].

===Government===
Government think tanks are also important in the United States, particularly in the security and defense field. These include the [[Institute for National Strategic Studies]], Institute for Homeland Security Studies, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy, at the [[National Defense University]]; the Center for Naval Warfare Studies at the [[Naval War College]] and the [[Strategic Studies Institute]] at the [[U.S. Army War College]].

The government funds, wholly or in part, activities at approximately 30 [[Federally Funded Research and Development Centers]] (FFRDCs). FFRDCs, are unique independent nonprofit entities sponsored and funded by the U.S. government to meet specific long-term technical needs that cannot be met by any other single organization. FFRDCs typically assist government agencies with scientific research and analysis, systems development, and systems acquisition. They bring together the expertise and outlook of government, industry, and academia to solve complex technical problems. These FFRDCs include the [[RAND Corporation]], the [[MITRE Corporation]], the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], the [[Aerospace Corporation]], the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], and other organizations supporting various departments within the U.S. Government.

Similar to the above quasi-governmental organizations are [[Federal Advisory Committee Act|Federal Advisory Committees]]. These groups, sometimes referred to as commissions, are a form of think tank dedicated to advising the US Presidents or the Executive branch of government. They typically focus on a specific issue and as such, might be considered similar to special interest groups. However, unlike special interest groups these committees have come under some oversight regulation and are required to make formal records available to the public. Approximately 1,000 these advisory committees are described in the FACA [http://fido.gov/facadatabase/search.asp searchable database].

==Other countries==

===Azerbaijan===
According to research done by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], there are a total of 12 think tanks in Azerbaijan.

[[The Center for Economic and Social Development]], or CESD; in [[Azeri|Azeri, Azerbaijan]], İqtisadi və Sosial İnkişaf Mərkəzi (İSİM) is an [[Azeri]] think tank, [[non-profit organization]], [[NGO]] based in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. The Center was established in 2005.

CESD focuses on policy advocacy and reform, and is involved with policy research and capacity building. CESD employs leading researchers prominent in their fields and enjoys a broad regional and international network. CESD has been set up to promote research into domestic and regional economic and social issues, advocacy towards reforms and capacity building for the purpose to positively impact the policy making and improve the participation.

CESD ranked as one of the top think tanks in the world by the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Go-To Think Tanks 2010&quot; /&gt; According to the University of Pennsylvania rankings – a result of surveys from 1500 scholars and [[peer review]] evaluation – the Center for Economic and Social Development (CESD) is one of the top 25 think tanks in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], including CIS. CESD is the only think tank from the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]] included in the top think tanks rankings.CESD is also ranked as one of the top 25 domestic economic policy thinks tanks in the world. Only CESD (ranked 19) and the Center for Economic and Social Research (CASE), (Poland, ranked 21) were included in the list from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and CIS countries.

The [[Economic Research Center]] (ERC) is a policy-research oriented non-profit think tank established in 1999 with a mission to facilitate sustainable economic development and good governance in the new public management system of Azerbaijan. It seeks to do this by building favorable interactions between the public, private and civil society and working with different networks both in local (EITI NGO Coalition, National Budget Group,  Public Coalition  Against Poverty and etc.) and international levels (PWYP, IBP, ENTO, ALDA, PASOS,  WTO NGO Network etc.). {{Citation needed|reason=While this is all very likely true, I cannot find references other than the website.|date=August 2011}}

*[[Center for Strategic Studies under the President of Azerbaijan]]

===Australia===
Most Australian think tanks are based at universities&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Think_tanks_based_in_Australia&lt;/ref&gt; – for example, the [[The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research|Melbourne Institute]] – or are government funded – for example, the [[Productivity Commission]] or the [[CSIRO]].

There are also about 20–30 &quot;independent&quot; Australian think tanks, which are funded by private sources. The best-known of these think tanks play a much more limited role in Australian public and business policy making than in the [[United States]]. However, in the past decade the number of think tanks has increased substantially.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Prominent Australian conservative think tanks include [[The Centre for Independent Studies]], the [[Sydney Institute]] and the [[Institute of Public Affairs]]. Prominent leftist Australian think tanks include [[Per Capita]], the Australia Institute, [[Lowy Institute]] and the Centre for Policy Development. In recent years regionally based independent and non-partisan think tanks have emerged. Some such as the Illawarra's i-eat-drink-think engage in discussion, research and advocacy within a broader   civics framework. Commercial think tanks like the Gartner Group, Access Economics, The Helmsman Institute, and others provide additional insight which complements not for profit organisations such as CEDA, the Strategic Policy Institute, and the Australian Institute of Company directors to provide more targeted policy in defence, program governance, corporate governance and similar.

===Brazil===
Brazil hosts pro-market independent think tanks working on public policies. Among them is [[Instituto Liberdade]], a University-based Center at Tecnopuc inside the  [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul]], located in the South Region of the country, at the city of [[Porto Alegre]].
Instituto Liberdade is among the Top 40 think tanks in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the 2009 Global Go To Think Tanks Index [,&lt;ref name=&quot;Go-To Think Tanks 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=James|title=The Global &quot;Go-To Think Tanks&quot;|url=http://www.fpri.org/research/thinktanks/GlobalGoToThinkTanks2009.pdf|publisher=the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; a report from the University of Pennsylvania's Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP).

===Ghana===
Ghana's first president, Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], set up various state-supported think tanks in the 1960s. By the 1990s, a variety of policy research centers sprang up in Africa set up by academics who sought to influence public policy in Ghana.

One such think tank was [[The Institute of Economic Affairs, Ghana]], which was founded in 1989 when the country was ruled by the [[Provisional National Defence Council]]. The IEA undertakes and publishes research on a range of economic and governance issues confronting [[Ghana]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  It has also been involved in bringing political parties together to engage in dialogue.  In particular it has organised Presidential debates every election year since the [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1996]].

Some of the active think tanks in Ghana include:

* [[IMANI Centre for Policy and Education]]
* [[The Institute of Economic Affairs, Ghana]] (IEA)
* [[The Center for Policy Analysis]] (CEPA)
