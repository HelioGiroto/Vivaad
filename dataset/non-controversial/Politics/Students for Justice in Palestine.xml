'''Students for Justice in Palestine''' (SJP) is a student group which was first established at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2001. There is no national group, just indivudal chapters. The UC Berkeley group's mission statement says: &quot;SJP is a diverse group of students, faculty, staff and community members at [establishment], organized on democratic principles to promote justice, human rights, liberation and self-determination for the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] people.&quot; 

In [[Canada]] the equivalent to Students for Justice in Palestine is [[Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights]] which has 13 campus branches across Canada.

==Principles==
SJP manifestly rejects attempts to equate principled criticism of [[Zionism]], or of the character or policies of Israel, with [[anti-Semitism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uscsjp.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;[http://uscsjp.wordpress.com/2006/08/29/6/ SJP Mission Statement Â« USC Students for Justice in Palestine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected activities ==
[[wikt:method|Methods]] used by Students for Justice in Palestine include [[divestment]] and [[boycott]] campaigns and educational and creative events designed to encourage discussion of Palestinian human, economic, political, social, and cultural rights.  It was the first campus group to launch a divestment campaign against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=8&amp;x_nameinnews=121&amp;x_article=383 CAMERA: Divestment Campaign on Campuses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2012}}

Activities include educational events, film screenings, discussion forums, and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] meant to promote awareness of the plight of the Palestinian people and encourage [[activism]] in solidarity with their struggle. 

In Auckland, SJP has led demonstrations against the local weapons industry including parking a model of a bombed out ambulance outside the shareholder AGM of [[Rakon]], a company that sells components to the IDF and US Military for use in guided munitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10399334&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/electronics/news/article.cfm?c_id=175&amp;objectid=10399334 |title=Excitement inside deafens protest |author=McKenzie-Minifie, Martha |date=2 September 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also organised demonstrations outside the offices of [[Oscmar International]] to protest its selling of military training simulators to Israel. In July and August, 2006 the group organised a series of five protests against Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The first protest turned into an alleyway brawl between activists and police after one person lowered the US flag on the US consulate to half-mast and attempted to climb down a drainpipe and evade police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indymedia.org.nz/newswire/display/50363/index.php Aotearoa IMC: Aucklanders march for Palestine and Lebanon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Free Speech Fight&quot; at UC Berkeley===
The [[University of California, Berkeley]] chapter of SJP came to international attention in April 2002 when they chose the memorial of the [[Deir Yassin massacre]] to occupy a campus building and disrupt a midterm in progress for over 600 students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycal.org/article/8263/israeli_palestinian_backers_clash_during_campus_ra Daily Cal - 10 April 2002 - Israeli, Palestinian Backers Clash During Campus Rally]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a protest against their university's investments in Israel. The occupation was broken up by police after warning the students of trespassing. Seventy-nine protesters were arrested, cited for trespassing, and, in some cases, resisting arrest. All but one were released. One protester wound up in jail, on a charge of felony battery after he bit a police officer. Following the arrests SJP was banned from operating at UCLA prompting SJP to begin a campaign against what they saw as the university attacking freedom of speech, assembly and protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refuseandresist.org/newresistance/043002sjp.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Over two hundred demonstrators turned out the month after on a national day of action, &quot;Free Palestine! Free Speech!&quot;, to protest what they saw as the university's stifling of freedom of thought and protest as well as the universities continuing links with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/article.cfm?archiveDate=05-03-02&amp;storyID=11715 Berkeley Daily Planet- 3 May 2002- Pro-Palestine protesters rally for free speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, UC Berkeley administrators gathered information that led them to believe that group that protesters would also try and seize a campus library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycal.org/sharticle.php?id=8514 Daily Cal- 26 April 2002- Students Arrested During Protest May Be Suspended]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divestment at Hampshire College===
In February 2009, Hampshire College's SJP announced that Hampshire College had decided to cut financial ties with companies that profited from Palestinian oppression. Some of the trustees of [[Hampshire College]] &quot;strenuously denied&quot; assertions by SJP that an investment decision made Hampshire the first United States college to sell stock in companies specifically because they do business with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/02/hamphire_colleg.html Hampshire College cuts ties with fund invested in Israel, Peter Schworm, Boston Globe, Feb. 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy remains whether the organization's campaigning among Board and administration members resulted in actual divestment from Israeli-incorporated and Israel-trafficking businesses.

==Controversy==
In April 2011, [[Avi Dichter]], Member of [[Knesset]] and member of Israel's centrist and [[Kadima]] party, was interrupted by protesters from a group of the Brandeis SJP, while speaking at [[Brandeis University]]. Several students got up out of their seats and called Dichter a [[war criminal]], and accused him of torture and crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/jewish-leftists-disrupt-kadima-mk-speech-at-u-s-university-1.354195 Jewish leftists disrupt Kadima MK speech at U.S. University]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, 16 African-American members of the Vanguard Leadership Group published full page ads in several U.S. university newspapers, with an &quot;Open Letter to Students for Justice in Palestine&quot; saying that the SJP's use of the word &quot;apartheid&quot; in regards to Israel and Israel Apartheid Week &quot;is not only false, but offensive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=215811 Black student leaders slam 'apartheid' characterization]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Jarrod Jordan, executive director of the Vanguard Leadership Group, said that SJP's holding a conference about Israel and apartheid is like &quot;the [[Ku Klux Klan]] holding a conference at [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta]], a total affront to Jewish culture and identity.â In addition, Jordan said that the use of the word 'apartheid' in referring to Israel is &quot;patently false and deeply offensive to all who feel a connection to the State of Israel.&quot; The [[Columbia Spectator]] refused to publish a full-page ad paid for by VLG because they &quot;judged it to be political.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/black_group_defends_israel_against_charge_apartheid Black Group Defends Israel Against Charge Of Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

== SJP National Conference 2011 ==
In October 2011, several SJP chapters convened for the first National Conference at Columbia University. The conference titled &quot;Students Confronting Apartheid&quot; has four main objectives that are, Movement Building, Campaign Building, Political Development, Skill Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sjpnational.org/2011/08/09/announcing-first-national-sjp-conference-2011/ Announcing First National SJP Conference â 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
