The question of whether to '''drill for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]''' (ANWR) has been an ongoing political controversy in the [[United States]] since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Shogren, Elizabeth. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5007819 &quot;For 30 Years, a Political Battle Over Oil and ANWR.&quot;] ''[[All Things Considered]]''. [[National Public Radio|NPR]]. 10 Nov. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue has been used by both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] as a political device, especially through contentious election cycles, and has been the subject of much debate in the [[News media (United States)|National media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;&gt;Waller, Douglas.

The land is situated between the [[Beaufort Sea]] to the north, [[Brooks Range]] to the south, and [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] to the west. It is the largest [[National Wildlife Refuge|protected]] [[wilderness]] in the United States and was created by [[United States Congress|Congress]] under the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;United States.

Much of the debate over whether to drill in the 1002 area of ANWR rests on the amount of economically recoverable oil, as it relates to world oil markets, weighed against the potential harm [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil exploration]] might have upon the [[National Wildlife Refuge|natural wildlife]], in particular the calving ground of the [[Porcupine caribou]].&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Mitchell, John.

==History==
[[Image:Alaskaoildrilling.jpg|thumb|250px|Mars Ice Island, a 60 day offshore exploratory well off Cape Halkett, over {{convert|30|mi|km}} from [[Nuiqsut, Alaska]].]]
[[File:Brooks Range Mountains ANWR.jpg|thumb|250px|Area 1002 of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] coastal plain, looking south toward the [[Brooks Range]] mountains.]]

Before Alaska was granted statehood on January 3, 1959, virtually all {{convert|375000000|acre|km2}} of the Territory of Alaska was federal land and wilderness. The [[Alaska Statehood Act|act granting statehood]] gave Alaska the right to select {{convert|103000000|acre|km2}} for use as an economic and tax base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCSA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=R.S.|date=June 1, 1981|title=ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971 (PUBLIC LAW 92-203):HISTORY AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS|publisher=Government Division|issue=Report No. 81-127 GOV}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1966, [[Alaska Natives]] protested a Federal oil and gas lease sale of lands on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] which were claimed by Natives. Late that year Secretary of the interior [[Stewart Udall]] ordered the lease sale suspended, and shortly thereafter announced a 'freeze' on the disposition of all Federal land in Alaska, pending Congressional settlement of Native land claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCSA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40D1EFA3D5B107B93C3A8178DD85F438685F9 &quot;Alaskans Dispute 'Freeze' on Land; Udall in Controversy Over State's Choice of Acreage.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 11 June 1967: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  

These claims were settled in 1971 by the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]], which granted them {{convert|44000000|acre|km2}}.  The act also froze development on federal lands pending a final selection of parks, monuments, and refuges.  The law was set to expire in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Kovach, Bill. [http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F17FE3A5513728DDDA00994DE405B888BF1D3 &quot;Bill on Future of Federal Lands in Alaska Generates Bitter and Emotional Controversy.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 19 June 1978: B4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 1976, with the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] virtually complete, major conservation groups shifted their attention to how best to protect the hundreds of millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness unaffected by the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Rensberger, Boyce.  [http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10E10F83E5D14768FDDA80B94D8415B868BF1D3 &quot;Protection of Alaska's Wilderness New Priority of Conservationists.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 31 Oct. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 1979, the [[United States House of Representatives]] approved a conservationist-backed bill that would have protected more than {{convert|125000000|acre|km2}} of Federal lands in Alaska, including the calving ground of the nation's largest caribou herd.  Backed by President [[Jimmy Carter]], and sponsored by [[Mo Udall|Morris K. Udall]] and [[John B. Anderson]], the bill would have prohibited all commercial activity in {{convert|67000000|acre|km2}} designated as wilderness areas. The US senate had opposed similar legislation in the past and filibusters were threatened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00E10F83F5D12728DDDAE0994DD405B898BF1D3 &quot;Alaskan Lands Bill Saing Vast Areas Approved by House.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 17 May 1979: A1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 2, 1980, Carter signed into law the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]], which created more than {{convert|104000000|acre|km2}} of national parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas from Federal holdings in that state.  The bill allowed drilling in ANWR, but not without prior approval from Congress. Both sides of the controversy announced they would attempt to change it in the next session of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;King, Seth. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F73C5E12728DDDAA0894DA415B8084F1D3 &quot;Carter Signs a Bill to Protect 104000000 Million acres in Alaska.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 3 Dec. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1002 of the act stated that a comprehensive inventory of fish and wildlife resources would be conducted on {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}} of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain (1002 Area). Potential petroleum reserves in the 1002 Area were to be evaluated from surface geological studies and seismic exploration surveys. No exploratory drilling was allowed. Results of these studies and recommendations for future management of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain were to be prepared in a report to Congress.

[[Image:Caribou calving map.jpg|thumb|350px|A map of [[Caribou]] calving grounds, 1983–2001.]]
In November 1986, a draft report by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended that all of the coastal plain within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened for oil and gas development.  It also proposed to trade the mineral rights of {{convert|166000|acre|km2}} in the refuge for surface rights to {{convert|896000|acre|km2}} owned by corporations of six Alaska native groups, including [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s, [[Eskimo]]s and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]s.  The report argued that the [[oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] potentials of the coastal plain were needed for the country's economy and [[national security]].&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50717FE3F580C768EDDA80994DE484D81 &quot;U.S. Proposing Drilling for Oil in Arctic Refuge.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 25 Nov. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation biology|Conservationists]] argued that oil development would unnecessarily threaten the existence of the [[Porcupine caribou]] by cutting off the [[herd]] from calving areas. They also expressed concerns that oil operations would erode the fragile ecological systems that support wildlife on the tundra of the Arctic plain.  The proposal faced stiff opposition in the House of Representatives.  Morris Udall, chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Interior Committee]], said he would reintroduce legislation to turn the entire coastal plain into a wilderness area, effectively  giving the refuge permanent protection from development.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50717FE3F580C768EDDA80994DE484D81 &quot;U.S. Proposing Drilling for Oil in Arctic Refuge.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 25 Nov. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anwr.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical view of the ANWR 1002 area coastal plain.]]

On July 17, 1987, the United States and the [[Canada|Canadian]] government signed the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd&quot;&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;[[United Nations]]. ''[http://untreaty.un.org/unts/144078_158780/16/2/7177.pdf Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the government of Canada on the Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd]'' New York: UNU. 1987.[http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/ANWR/anwrint-agreement.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a treaty which was designed to protect the species from damage to its habitat and migration routes.  Canada has special interest in the region because its [[Ivvavik National Park]] and [[Vuntut National Park]] borders the refuge. The treaty required an impact assessment and required that where activity in one country is &quot;likely to cause significant long-term adverse impact on the Porcupine Caribou Herd or its habitat, the other Party will be notified and given an opportunity to consult prior to final decision.&quot;&lt;ref name=untreaty /&gt;

In March 1989, a bill permitting drilling in the reserve was &quot;sailing through the Senate and had been expected to come up for a vote&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dionne, E. J. Jr. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDB1639F930A35757C0A96F948260&amp;scp=19&amp;sq=+Arctic+Refuge+drill&amp;st=nyt &quot;Big Oil Spill Leaves Its Mark On Politics of Environment.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 3 Apr. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] delayed and ultimately derailed the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DE103AF931A25757C0A96F948260&amp;scp=15&amp;sq=arctic+refuge+spill&amp;st=nyt &quot;Reaction to Alaska Spill Derails Bill to Allow Oil Drilling in Refuge.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' 12 Apr. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Energy Bill authorized drilling in ANWR, but a [[filibuster]] by Senate Democrats kept the measure from coming to a vote. In 1995, Republicans prepared to take up the battle again and included a provision for ANWR in the federal budget. President [[Bill Clinton]] vetoed the entire budget and expressed his intention to [[veto]] any other bill that would open ANWR to drilling. --&gt;
In 1996, the Republican-majority House and Senate voted to allow drilling in ANWR, but this legislation was [[veto]]ed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Toward the end of his presidential term [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] pressed Clinton to declare the Arctic Refuge a [[U.S. National Monument]]. Doing so would have permanently closed the area to oil exploration. While Clinton did create several refuge monuments, the Arctic Refuge was not among them.

A 1998 report by the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] estimated that there was between {{convert|5.7|Goilbbl|m3}} and {{convert|16.0|Goilbbl|m3}} of technically recoverable oil in the designated 1002 area, and that most of the oil would be found west of the [[List of rivers of Alaska|Marsh Creek]] [[anticline]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;United States Geological Survey. ''[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-0028-01/fs-0028-01.pdf Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 1002 Area, Petroleum Assessment 1998, Including Economic Analysis.]'' USGS Fact Sheet FS-028-01, Apr. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; When Non-Federal and Native areas are excluded, the estimated amounts of technically recoverable oil are reduced to {{convert|4.3|Goilbbl|m3}} and {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl|m3}}. These figures differed from an earlier 1987 USGS report which estimated less quantities of oil and that it would be found in the southern and eastern parts of the 1002 area. However the 1998 report warned that the &quot;estimates cannot be compared directly because different methods were used in preparing those parts of the 1987 Report to Congress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'United States Geological Survey. ''[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-0028-01/fs-0028-01.pdf Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 1002 Area, Petroleum Assessment 1998, Including Economic Analysis.]'' USGS Fact Sheet FS-028-01, Apr. 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, votes about the status of the refuge occurred repeatedly in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. President [[George W. Bush]] pushed to perform exploratory drilling for [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] in and around the refuge. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted in mid-2000 to allow drilling. In April 2002 the [[United States Senate|Senate]] rejected it.

Arctic Refuge drilling was again approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives as part of the Energy Bill on April 21, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;United States. House of Representatives. [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.6: Bill Number H.R.6 for the 109th Congress.] Washington, DC: Library of Congress. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Arctic Refuge provision was later removed by the House-Senate [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]].  The Republican-controlled Senate passed Arctic Refuge drilling on March 16, 2005 as part of the federal budget resolution for fiscal year 2006.&lt;ref&gt;United States. ''[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:sc18pcs.txt.pdf The Congressional Budget for the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2006]''. Washington, DC: GPO. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; That Arctic Refuge provision was removed during the reconciliation process, due to Democrats in the House of Representatives who signed a letter stating they would oppose any version of the budget that had Arctic Refuge drilling in it.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Andrew. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/09/AR2005110902029.html &quot;House Drops Arctic Drilling From Bill.&quot;] ''[[Washington Post]]'' 10 Nov. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On December 15, 2005, Senator [[Ted Stevens]], a Republican from Alaska, attached an Arctic Refuge drilling amendment to the annual defense appropriations bill. A group of Democratic Senators led a successful [[filibuster]] of the bill on December 21, and the language was subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;Coile, Zachary.

On June 18, 2008, President George W. Bush pressed Congress to reverse the ban on [[offshore drilling]] in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in addition to approving the extraction of oil from [[shale]] on federal lands. Despite his previous stance on the issue, President Bush cited the growing [[energy crisis]] as a major factor for reversing the presidential executive order issued by President George H. W. Bush in 1990, which banned coastal oil exploration and oil and gas leasing on most of the outer [[continental shelf]]. In conjunction with the presidential order, the Congressional moratorium banning drilling was first enacted in 1982 and has been renewed annually.&lt;ref&gt;Stolbert, Sheryl.

==Department of Energy projections and estimates==
===Estimates of oil reserves===
[[Image:2 USGA ANWR Oil.png|thumb|350px|Projected levels of increased oil production from ANWR to mean Alaskan production volumes. [[Energy Information Administration]], 2008.]]

In 1998, the USGS estimated that between 5.7 and {{convert|16.0|Goilbbl|m3}} of technically recoverable crude oil and natural gas liquids are in the coastal plain area of ANWR, with a mean estimate of {{convert|10.4|Goilbbl|m3}}, of which {{convert|7.7|Goilbbl|m3}} lie within the Federal portion of the ANWR 1002 Area.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;/&gt;  In comparison, the estimated volume of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in the rest of the United States is about {{convert|120|Goilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref name=doeeia&gt;United States. Department of Energy. Energy Information Administration. ''[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/anwr/ Analysis of Crude Oil Production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.]'' SR/OIAF/2008-03. Washington, DC: GPO. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ANWR and undiscovered estimates are categorized as [[Oil reserves#Resources|prospective resources]] and therefore, not [[Oil reserves#Proved reserves|proved]]. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) reports US proved reserves are roughly {{convert|29|Goilbbl|m3}} of crude and natural gas liquids, of which {{convert|21|Goilbbl|m3}} are crude.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Department of Energy. Energy Information Administration. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/crude_oil_natural_gas_reserves/current/pdf/ch3.pdf ''U.S. Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves Report]'' Washington, DC: GPO. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of sources compiled by the DOE estimate world proved oil and gas condensate reserves to range from 1.1 to {{convert|1.3|Toilbbl|km3}}.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Department of Energy. Energy Information Administration. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/reserves.html &quot;Table of World Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves.&quot;] Doe.gov. Retrieved on 2008-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOE reports there is uncertainty about the underlying resource base in ANWR. “The USGS oil resource estimates are based largely on the oil productivity of geologic formations that exist in the neighboring State lands and which continue into ANWR. Consequently, there is considerable uncertainty regarding both the size and quality of the oil resources that exist in ANWR. Thus, the potential ultimate oil recovery and potential yearly production are highly uncertain.” &lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt;

In 2010, the USGS revised an estimate of the oil in the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] (NPRA), concluding that it contained approximately &quot;896 million barrels of conventional, undiscovered oil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2622 USGS Release: USGS Oil and Gas Resource Estimates Updated for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA) (10/26/2010 12:43:17 PM)]. Usgs.gov. Retrieved on 2011-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NPRA is west of ANWR. The reason for the decrease is because of new exploratory drilling, which showed that many areas that were believed to hold oil actually hold natural gas.

The opening of the ANWR 1002 Area to oil and natural gas development is projected to increase domestic crude oil production starting in 2018. In the mean ANWR oil resource case, additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR reaches {{convert|780000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2027 and then declines to {{convert|710000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2030. In the low and high ANWR oil resource cases, additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR peaks in 2028 at 510,000 and {{convert|1.45|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt;

Between 2018 and 2030, cumulative additional oil production is {{convert|2.6|Goilbbl|m3}} for the mean oil resource case, while the low and high resource cases project a cumulative additional oil production of 1.9 and {{convert|4.3|Goilbbl|m3}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt; In 2007, the United States consumed 20.68 m bbls of petroleum products per day. It produced roughly {{convert|5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil, and imported {{convert|10|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude and {{convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Department of Energy. Energy Information Administration. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/basics/quickoil.html &quot;Petroleum Basic you smell Statistics.&quot;] Retrieved on 2008-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projected impact on global oil price===
The total production from ANWR would be between 0.4 and 1.2 percent of total world oil consumption in 2030. Consequently, ANWR oil production is not projected to have any significant impact on world oil prices.&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt; Furthermore, the [[Energy Information Administration]] does not feel ANWR will affect the global price of oil when past behaviors of the oil market are considered. &quot;The opening of '''ANWR''' is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows: a reduction in low-sulfur, light crude oil prices of $0.41 per barrel (2006 dollars) in 2026 for the low oil resource case, $0.75 per barrel in 2025 for the mean oil resource case, and $1.44 per barrel in 2027 for the high oil resource case, relative to the reference case.&quot;&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt; &quot;Assuming that world oil markets continue to work as they do today, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could neutralize any potential price impact of ANWR oil production by reducing its oil exports by an equal amount.&quot;&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt;

The United States Department of Energy estimates that ANWR oil production between 2018 and 2030 would reduce the cumulative net expenditures on imported crude oil and liquid fuels by an estimated $135 to $327 billion (2006 dollars), reducing the foreign trade deficit.

Arctic Power cites a  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report which states that 77 of the 567 wildlife refuges in 22 states had oil and gas activities. Louisiana had the most with 19 units followed by Texas which had 11 units. Furthermore, oil or gas was produced in 45 of the 567 units located in 15 states. The number of producing wells in each unit ranged from one to more than 300 in the Upper Ouachita National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;United States. U.S. General Accounting Office.

In 2008, the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] reported uncertainties about the USGS oil estimates for ANWR and the projected effects on oil price and supplies. &quot;There is little direct knowledge regarding the petroleum geology of the ANWR region.... ANWR oil production is not projected to have a large impact on world oil prices.... Additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR would be only a small portion of total world oil production, and would likely be offset in part by somewhat lower production outside the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=doeeia /&gt;

&quot;Environmentalists and most congressional Democrats have resisted drilling in the area because the required network of oil platforms, pipelines, roads and support facilities, not to mention the threat of foul spills, would play havoc on wildlife. The coastal plain, for example, is a calving home for some 129,000 caribou.&quot;   &lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;&gt;Waller, Douglas.
