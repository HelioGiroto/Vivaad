'''Election Day''' in the [[United Kingdom]] is by tradition a Thursday. Under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], all future General Elections shall take place on the first Thursday in May every five years, barring special circumstances. Most other European countries hold all [[Election Day (politics)|Elections on Sundays]]. Polls in the United Kingdom open at 7:00 and close at 22:00.

==UK General Elections==
A [[United Kingdom general elections|General Election in the UK]] follows the dissolution of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by the [[British monarch|Queen]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the day.  The Prime Minister thus has the power to choose the date of the election.  Thursday has been the customary day to hold elections since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05166.pdf|title=Timing of Parliamentary election counts|last=White|first=Isobel|date=22 September 2009|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons Library]]|pages=3|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, elections took place over the course of a four-week period until 1918. Election days were then as follows:
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|14 December 1918]] - Saturday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|15 November 1922]] - Wednesday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|6 December 1923]] - Thursday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|29 October 1924]] - Wednesday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|30 May 1929]] - Thursday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|27 October 1931]] - Tuesday
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|14 October 1935]] - Thursday
and elections have been on Thursdays since then:
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|5 July 1945]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|23 February 1950]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|25 October 1951]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|26 May 1955]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|8 October 1959]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|15 October 1964]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|31 March 1966]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|18 June 1970]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|28 February 1974]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|10 October 1974]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|3 May 1979]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|9 June 1983]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|11 June 1987]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|9 April 1992]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1 May 1997]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|7 June 2001]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|5 May 2005]]
* [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|6 May 2010]]

==Other UK elections==
Local elections in England and Wales are by statute held on the first Thursday in May.  This has been changed in recent years: in 2001 they were delayed while an outbreak of [[Foot and Mouth Disease]] was dealt with, and in 2004 and 2009 they were delayed to coincide with elections for the [[European Parliament]]. But they were eventually held on Thursdays.
By-elections and other UK elections are also traditionally held on Thursdays though they can be held on other days - in particular when they would otherwise clash with bank holidays. The last Parliamentary by-election not to be held on a Thursday was the [[Hamilton by-election, 1978|Hamilton by-election]] of 31 May 1978. This was held on a Wednesday as the returning officer wished to avoid a clash with the opening game of the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].

In 2010, the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2010|local elections]] were held on the same day as the general elections (Thursday, 6 May).
