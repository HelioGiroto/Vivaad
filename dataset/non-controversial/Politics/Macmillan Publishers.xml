'''Macmillan Publishers Ltd''', also known as '''The Macmillan Group''', is a [[Private company|privately held]] [[international]] [[publishing company]] owned by [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]. It has offices in 41 countries worldwide and operates in more than thirty others.

==History==
{{story|date=July 2012}}
[[Image:MacMillan and Co logo 1880.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This logo appeared in [[Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen's]] biography of [[Alexander Pope]], published by Macmillan &amp; Co in 1880.]]

Macmillan was founded in 1843 by [[Daniel Macmillan|Daniel]] and [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], two brothers from the [[Isle of Arran]], Scotland. Daniel was the business brain, while Alexander laid the literary foundations, publishing such great authors as [[Charles Kingsley]] (1855), [[Thomas Hughes]] (1859), [[Francis Turner Palgrave]] (1861), [[Christina Rossetti]] (1862), [[Matthew Arnold]] (1865) and [[Lewis Carroll]] (1865). [[Alfred Tennyson]] joined the list in 1884, [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1886 and [[Rudyard Kipling]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.macmillan.com/History.aspx |title=Macmillan History |publisher=International.macmillan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company evolved, the brothers' vision continued to inspire the publishing of major writers including [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sean O'Casey]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Charles Langbridge Morgan|Charles Morgan]], [[Hugh Walpole]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[C. P. Snow]], [[Rumer Godden]] and [[Ram Sharan Sharma]].

Beyond literature, their vision led to the creation of such enduring titles as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (1869), the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1877) and [[Inglis Palgrave|Sir Robert Palgrave]]'s ''Dictionary of Political Economy'' (1894–99).

Macmillan established an office in New York City.  It sold its American division in 1896, which published as the Macmillan Company.  

Macmillan Publishers re-entered the American market in 1954 under the name [[St. Martin's Press]].
After retiring from politics in 1964, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Harold Macmillan]] became chairman of the company, serving until his death in December 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/macmillan_harold.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was one of the oldest independent publishing houses until 1995, when a 70% share of the company was bought by German media giant [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] (''Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]''). Holtzbrinck purchased the remaining shares in 1999, ending the Macmillan family's ownership of the company.

Since 2007 the CEO of Macmillan Publishers Ltd has been [[Annette Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.macmillan.com/AboutUs.aspx?id=980 |title=Macmillan Management Team |publisher=International.macmillan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/46148-thomas-made-ceo-of-macmillan.html |title=Thomas made c.e.o. of Macmillan |publisher=Thebookseller.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macmillan in the United States===
[[George Edward Brett]] opened the first Macmillan office in the United States in 1869 and Macmillan sold its U.S. operations to the Brett family, [[George Platt Brett, Sr.]] and [[George Platt Brett]], Jr. in 1896, resulting in the creation of an American company, [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing]], also called the Macmillan Company. Even with the split of the American company from its parent company in England, George Brett, Jr. and Harold Macmillan remained close personal friends.

George P. Brett, Jr. made the following comments in a letter dated 23 January 1947 to Daniel Macmillan about his family's devotion to the American publishing industry:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For the record my grandfather was employed by Macmillan's of England as a salesman.  He came to the United States with his family in the service of Macmillan's of England and built up a business of approximately $50,000 before he died.  He was succeeded . . . by my father, who eventually incorporated The Macmillan Company of New York and built up business of about $9,000,000.  I succeeded my father, and we currently doing a business of approximately $12,000,000.  So then, the name of Brett and the name of Macmillan have been and are synonymous in the United States.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] acquired the Macmillan name in America in 1998, following its purchase of the Simon &amp; Schuster educational and professional group (which included various Macmillan properties).&lt;ref&gt;''Publishers Weekly'', [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6488163.html Publishersweekly.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Holtzbrinck purchased it from them in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Bookseller'', [http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4655423-1.html Allbusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw-Hill continues to market its pre-kindergarten through elementary school titles under its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill brand. U.S. operations of Georg von Holtzbrinck are now known as Macmillan.

The current CEO of Macmillan U.S. is [[John Turner Sargent|John Turner Sargent, Jr.]]

====E-books====
By some estimates, as of 2009 [[e-book]]s account for three to five per cent of total book sales, and are the fastest growing segment of the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt091029&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Macmillan Lowers E-Book Payments for Authors | url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/macmillan-lowers-e-book-payments-for-authors/ | author=Motoko Rich |work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate= 2010-02-11 | date= October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Macmillan and other major publishers &quot;fear that massive discounting [of e-books] by retailers including [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] and [[Sony Connect|Sony]] could ultimately devalue what consumers are willing to pay for books.&quot;  In response, the publisher introduced a new [[Standard form contract|boilerplate contract]] for its authors that established a royalty of 20 per cent of net proceeds on e-book sales, a rate five per cent lower than most other major publishers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt091029&quot;/&gt;

Following the announcement of the [[Apple iPad]] on January 27, 2010—a product that comes with access to the [[iBookstore]]—Macmillan gave Amazon.com two options: continue to sell e-books based on a price of the retailer's choice (the &quot;[[wholesale]] model&quot;), with the e-book edition released several months after the hardcover edition is released, or switch to the [[Agency (law)|agency]] model introduced to the industry by Apple, in which both are released simultaneously and the price is set by the publisher.  In the latter case, Amazon.com would receive a 30 per cent [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt100131&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Publisher Wins Fight With Amazon Over E-Books | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/technology/companies/01amazonweb.html | author=Motoko Rich and Brad Stone |work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate= 2010-02-11 | date= January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazon responded by pulling all Macmillan books, both electronic and physical, from their website (although affiliates selling the books were still listed). On January 31, 2010, Amazon chose the agency model and &quot;capitulated&quot; to the change demanded by Macmillan, in spite of Amazon's belief that the new model leads to e-book prices that are &quot;needlessly high.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_tfp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx2MEGQWTNGIMHV&amp;displayType=tagsDetail | title=Macmillan E-books | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | work=Kindle Community | author=The Amazon Kindle team | date=January 31, 2010 |  accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
