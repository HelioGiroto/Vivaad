{{Legislature}}
In [[government]], '''unicameralism''' (Latin {{lang|la|''uni''}}, one + {{lang|la|''camera''}}, chamber) is the practice of having one legislative or [[parliamentary chamber]]. Thus, a ''unicameral parliament'' or ''unicameral legislature'' is a [[legislature]] which consists of one chamber or house.  Unicameral legislatures typically exist in small and homogeneous unitary states, where a second chamber is considered unnecessary.

==Concept==
Unicameral legislatures exist when there is no widely perceived need for [[multicameralism]]. Many multicameral legislatures were created to give separate voices to different sectors of society. Multiple chambers allowed for guaranteed representation of different social classes (as in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] or the [[France|French]] [[French States-General|States-General]]), ethnic or regional interests, or subunits of a [[federation]]. Where these factors are unimportant, in unitary states with weak regional identity, unicameralism often prevails. Sometimes, as in [[New Zealand]] and [[Denmark]], this comes about through the abolition of one the two chambers, or, as in [[Sweden]], through the merger of the two chambers into a single one, while in others a second chamber has never existed.

Unicameral legislatures are also common in [[Communist]] states such as the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Cuba]]. Similarly, many formerly Communist states, such as [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Serbia]], have retained their unicameral legislatures, though others, such as [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], adopted bicameral legislatures after the fall of Communism. The socialist viewpoint regards [[upper house]]s as typically [[conservative]] and representing the interests of the [[upper classes]].

The principal advantage of a unicameral system is more efficient lawmaking, as the legislative process is much simpler and there is no possibility of [[legislative deadlock]]. Proponents of unicameralism have also argued that it reduces costs, as even if the number of legislators is the same as it would be in a multicameral system, there are fewer institutions to maintain and support.

The main weakness of a unicameral system can be seen as the lack of restraint on the [[majority]], particularly noticeable in [[parliamentary system]]s where the leaders of the parliamentary majority also dominate the [[executive (government)|executive]]. There is also the risk, depending on how seats are allocated in the legislature, that important sectors of society may not be adequately represented.

==List of unicameral legislatures==

Approximately half of the world's [[sovereign state]]s are presently unicameral, including both the most populous (the [[People's Republic of China]]) and the least populous (the [[Vatican City]]).

Many [[Subnational entity|subnational entities]] have unicameral legislatures. These include [[Nebraska]], [[Guam]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] in the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Australian]] states and territories of [[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], all of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] in [[Canada]], all of the [[States of Germany|German Bundesländer]], all of the [[Regions of Italy|Italian Regioni]] and all of the [[Spanish Autonomous Communities]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], and [[London Assembly]] are also unicameral.

Almost all city legislatures are also unicameral in the sense that the [[city council]]s are not divided into two chambers. Until the turn of the 20th century, bicameral city councils were common in the United States{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

==Unicameralism within the subdivisions of the United States==

Within [[U.S. states]], [[Nebraska]] is currently the only state with a unicameral legislature. [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska's state legislature]] is also unique in the sense that it is the only state legislature that is entirely [[nonpartisan]].

Local government legislatures of counties, cities, or other political subdivisions within states are usually unicameral and have limited lawmaking powers compared to their state and federal counterparts.

In 1999, Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] proposed converting the [[Minnesota Legislature]] into a single unicameral chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199904/29_kastem_uni/ One People - One House]&lt;/ref&gt; Although debated, the idea was never adopted.

In a non-binding referendum held on July 10, 2004, voters in the [[U.S. territory]] of [[Puerto Rico]] approved changing its [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|Legislative Assembly]] to a unicameral body by 456,267 votes in favor (83.7%) versus 88,720 against (16.3%). If both the territory's [[Puerto Rico House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Puerto Rico Senate|Senate]] approve by a 2/3 vote the specific amendments to the [[Puerto Rico Constitution]] that are required for the change to a unicameral legislature, another referendum will be held in the territory to approve such amendments. If those constitutional changes are approved, Puerto Rico could switch to a unicameral legislature as early as 2015.

On June 9, 2009, the [[Maine House of Representatives]] voted to form a unicameral legislature, but the measure did not pass the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_124th/billpdfs/HP100001.pdf RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Establish a Unicameral Legislature]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of legislative gridlock in 2009, former Congressman [[Rick Lazio]], a prospective candidate for governor, has proposed that [[New York]] adopt unicameralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/opinion/14lazio.html One for All], [[Rick Lazio]], ''New York Times'', July 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicameralism in the Philippines==
Unicameralism was experienced in the [[Philippines]] from 1935-1940 during the Commonwealth period. In the 1973 Constitution, the legislative system was called [[Batasang Pambansa]] in a [[parliamentary system]] of the government until 1986.

The ongoing process of amending or revising the current constitution and form of government is popularly known as [[Charter Change]]. A shift to a unicameral parliament is included in the proposals of the constitutional commission created by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concom.ph/proposals/ Constitutional Commission proposals]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the United States, senators in the [[Senate of the Philippines]] are elected not per district and state but nationally; the [[Philippines]] is a [[unitary state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080225020806/http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/a6.asp Philippines : Gov.Ph : About the Philippines ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine government's decision-making process, relative to the United States, is more rigid, highly centralized, much slower and susceptible to political &quot;gridlocks.&quot; As a result, the trend for unicameralism as well as other political system reforms are more contentious in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concom.ph/news/oct192005whychange.php Why Change?]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Congress is bicameral, all local legislatures are unicameral: the [[ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly]], the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (Provincial Boards), [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] (City Councils), [[Sangguniang Bayan]] (Municipal Councils), [[Sangguniang Barangay]] ([[Barangay]] Councils) and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (Youth Councils).
