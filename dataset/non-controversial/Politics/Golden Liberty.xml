'''Golden Liberty''' ({{lang-la|Aurea Libertas}}; {{lang-pl|Złota Wolność}}, {{lang-lt|Auksinė laisvė}}), sometimes referred to as '''Golden Freedoms''', '''Nobles' Democracy''' or '''Nobles' Commonwealth''' ({{lang-pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]] [[szlachta|Szlachecka]]}} or ''Złota wolność szlachecka'', {{lang-la|áurea libertas}}) refers to a unique [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[political system]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and later, after the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569), in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Under that system, all nobles (''[[szlachta]]''), regardless of economic status, were considered to have equal legal status and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. The nobility controlled the legislature ([[Sejm]] — the Polish [[Parliament]]) and the Commonwealth's [[elective monarchy|elected king]].

==Development==
This political system, unique within Europe, stemmed from the consolidation of power by the [[szlachta]] ([[nobility|noble class]]) over other social classes and over the [[political system]] of [[monarchy]]. In time, the [[Szlachta's privileges|szlachta accumulated enough privileges]] (such as those established by the [[Nihil novi]] Act of 1505, [[King Henry's Articles]] of 1573 and later through various [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]) that no monarch could hope to break the szlachta's grip on power.

The political doctrine of the Commonwealth of Both Nations was: ''our state is a republic under the presidency of the King''. [[Kanclerz|Chancellor]] [[Jan Zamoyski]] summed up this doctrine when he said that ''&quot;Rex regnat et non gubernat&quot;'' (&quot;The King reigns but does not govern&quot;){{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a ''[[Offices_in_the_Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth#Senatorial_offices|Senat]]'' and an elected king. The king was obliged to respect citizens' rights specified in [[King Henry's Articles]] as well as in ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]]'' negotiated at the time of his election.

The monarch's power was limited, in favor of the sizable noble class. Each new king had to subscribe to King Henry's Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political system (and included almost unprecedented guarantees of [[religious tolerance]]). Over time, King Henry's Articles were merged with the pacta conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of [[senator]]s.

The foundation of the Commonwealth's political system, the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; ({{lang-pl|Złota Wolność}}, a term used from 1573), included:
* the [[Royal elections in Poland|election]] of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as ''wolna elekcja'' (free election);
* [[Sejm]], the Commonwealth parliament which the king was required to hold every two years;
* ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]]'' ([[Latin]]), &quot;agreed-to agreements&quot; negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier [[King Henry's Articles]];
* ''[[rokosz]]'' ([[insurrection]]), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms;
* ''[[Religious toleration|religious freedom]]'' guaranted by [[Warsaw Confederation|Warsaw Confederation Act 1573]],&lt;ref&gt;# Norman Davies, God's Playground. A History of Poland, Vol. 1: The Origins to 1795, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-925339-0 / ISBN 0-19-925340-4&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[liberum veto]]'' ([[Latin]]), the right of an individual land envoy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a &quot;free veto&quot; nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the [[liberum veto]] in provincial [[sejmik]]s;
* ''[[konfederacja]]'' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[confederatio]]''), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim.

The Commonwealth's political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of:
* [[confederation]] and [[federation]], with regard to the broad [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] of its regions. It is however difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both of them;
* [[oligarchy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gella&quot;/&gt; as only the szlachta—around 10% of the population—had political rights;
* democracy, since all the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including [[legislation]] (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 10% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the szlachta) was a substantially larger percentage than in any other European country, and the nobles extended from powerful princes to poor knights poorer than many peasants; note that in 1831 in France only about 1% of the population had the right to vote, and in 1832 in the United Kingdom, only about 14% of Male adults;
* [[elective monarchy]], since the monarch, elected by the szlachta, was Head of State;
* [[constitutional monarchy]], since the monarch was bound by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] and other laws, and the szlachta could disobey any king's decrees they deemed illegal.

==Assessment==
The &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; was a unique and controversial feature of Poland's political system. It was an exception, characterized by a strong aristocracy and a feeble king, in an age when [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] was developing in the principal countries of Europe ― an exception, however, characterized by a striking similarity to certain modern values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav262&quot;&gt;Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-19-925339-0, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when most European countries were headed toward [[centralization]], [[absolute monarchy]] and religious and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with [[decentralization]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gella&quot;/&gt; [[confederation]] and [[federation]], democracy, [[religious tolerance]] and even [[pacifism]]. Since the Sejm usually vetoed a monarch's plans for war, this constitutes a notable argument for the [[democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Northern Wars: War, State and Society in northeastern Europe, 1558–1721 |first=Robert I.|last= Frost|publisher=Longman's|location= Harlow, England; New York}} 2000.

Perhaps the closest parallels to Poland's 'Noble Democracy' can be found outside Europe altogether ― in America ― among the [[slave]]-owning aristocracy of [[Southern United States|The South]], where slave-owning democrats and founding fathers of the USA such as [[Thomas Jefferson]] or [[George Washington]] had many values in common with the reformist noblemen of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav282&quot;&gt;Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-19-925339-0, p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Others however criticize the Golden Liberty, pointing out it was limited only to the nobility, excluding peasants or townsfolk&lt;ref name=&quot;HGK&quot;&gt;Helmut Georg Koenigsberger, ''Monarchies, States Generals and Parliaments'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-521-80330-6, [http://books.google.com/books?id=2V1dbsvEWnkC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=%22Golden+Liberty%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=In9QR7y8OJ_QpwLp3rTMBw&amp;sig=KHuUrTUUAFvn_xPS6uZBqDTHyJs Google Print, p.336]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave no legal system to grant [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[liberty]] to the majority of the population, failing them by failing to protect them from the excesses of the nobility, resulting in the slow development of cities and the [[second serfdom]] among the peasants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domar&quot;&gt;[http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/001447.html The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis], discussion and full online text of [[Evsey Domar]] (1970) &quot;The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis,&quot; [[Economic History Review]] '''30''':1 (March), pp18–32&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth was called ''Noble's Paradise'', sometimes ― ''the Jewish Paradise'', but also ''Purgatory for the Townsfolk ([[Bourgeoisie|Burghers]])'' and ''Hell for the Peasants''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav160&quot;&gt;Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-19-925339-0, [http://books.google.com/books?id=b912JnKpYTkC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=noble+paradise+peasant+hell+purgatory&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=RIdQR_7GBIrepgLMxLzfAQ&amp;sig=fcizWkw4X6m3ht4gn5OFCQzu8cA Google Print, p.160]&lt;/ref&gt; And even among the nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), the Golden Liberty became abused and twisted by the most powerful of them ([[magnates]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;HGK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LukZaw&quot;&gt;Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, ISBN 0-521-85332-X, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HMylRh-wHWEC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Golden+Liberty%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=-oVQR8qbL6bqoQLKs-wc&amp;sig=JpSe6O8nMfLqZYGtlTb-AVdViIs Google Print, p.88]&lt;/ref&gt; However, one should note that this “''the Jewish Paradise, but also Purgatory for the Townsfolk and Hell for the Peasants''” was first said by a 20th century Jewish-German novelist [[Alfred Döblin]], not by the people of that time, and it should be evaluated whether this really reflects the fact of the age.

==Similar systems==
Golden Liberty created a state that was unusual for its time, although somewhat similar [[political system]]s existed in the contemporary [[city-state]]s like the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Olk&quot;&gt;[[Joanna Olkiewicz]], ''Najaśniejsza Republika Wenecka'' (Most Serene Republic of Venice), Książka i Wiedza, 1972, Warszawa&lt;/ref&gt; (interestingly both states were styled the &quot;Most Serene Republic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;[[Joseph Conrad]], ''Notes on Life and Letters: Notes on Life and Letters'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-56163-9, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521561639&amp;id=x8oAq189BcwC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=autonomy+Polish-Lithuanian+Commonwealth&amp;sig=NamslH94ra0LUsjcr8FSOPMNmzo Google Print, p422 (notes)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

A similar fate was averted by Italy; first due to a secular inability of the kings of France and Spain, and the Papacy, to come to terms on how to divide the country, then through the reaction against [[Habsburg]] domination which, as late as 1861, finally aligned most of the country's states in support of a national monarchy under King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the [[House of Savoy]], hitherto king of [[Sardinia]].

Notably, neither the Republic of Venice nor Italy had a ''[[liberum veto]]'' among their institutions.

==Proverb==
The rights and privileges of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish(-Lithuanian)]] [[szlachta|nobility]] became [[proverb]]ial.  A popular Polish saying avers:

{{blockquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie równy wojewodzie''}}

—literally,

{{blockquote|&quot;The noble on his estate is equal to the [[voivode]]&quot;}}

In Poland to these days it means that there is no man that a freeman (a better, philosophical meaning of 'szlachcic') would think of as a superior.
