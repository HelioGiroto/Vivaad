      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">'''La Réunion''' was a [[socialist]] [[utopian socialism|utopian]] [[community]] formed in 1855 by [[French people|French]], [[Belgian]], and [[Swiss]] colonists near the forks of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in [[Texas]], [[USA]].  The [[Reunion Tower]] in [[Downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] is about three miles east of the colony site. The founders of the community were inspired by the [[utopian]] thought of the French [[philosopher]] [[Charles Fourier|François Marie Charles Fourier]].  Followers of Fourier established 29 similar colonies in various parts of the [[United States]] during the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1860 the declining colony was incorporated into the expanding city of Dallas.

==Brief history==
The founders of '''La Réunion''' intended it to become a socialist [[utopian]] colony; they were  inspired by the writings of the French philosopher [[Charles Fourier]], who advocated communal production and distribution for communal profit. Unlike other early communist systems, both men and women could vote and individuals could own private property.

===Founder of La Réunion===
La Réunion was founded in Texas by [[Victor Prosper Considerant]], a member of the [[Fourier movement]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]].  He had been forced into exile after staging protests against Napoléon III's military expedition to Rome.  After personally inspecting an area near the three forks of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in [[Texas]], he returned to Europe where he formed a group of future settlers. (The site of the community was in the present-day Reunion District of Dallas, about three miles west of the Reunion Tower.)

===Land purchase===
Advance agent [[François Cantegral]] was sent ahead to sell {{convert|2|acre|m2}} at $700 per acre to establish the location of colony. As the land was not good for farming, the property was a poor choice for the intended colony, although most of the would-be colonists were not farmers. Approximately 200 colonists arrived by ship near present-day [[Houston]]. They walked overland to the site of their new colony approximately {{convert|250|mi|km}} northward, with their possessions hauled by ox carts, and arrived on April 22, 1855.

===Original population===
The general area surrounding the three forks of the Trinity River had about 400 inhabitants at the time. The addition of the French colonists nearly doubled the population. The new arrivals spoke a different language from the settlers, believed in a different system of government and Catholic faith, and brought with them skills that the existing farmers did not possess. The watchmaking, weaving, brewing and storekeeping skills of the new colonists were ill-suited to the establishment of a colony, because they lacked the ability to produce food for themselves.

===Texas weather===
Although the colonists cultivated wheat and vegetables, they did not produce enough for their needs or in time; their biggest handicap was the uncooperative weather of Texas. A [[blizzard]] in May 1856 destroyed the colony's crops and turned the Trinity River into a sheet of ice.  That summer the Texas heat created drought conditions, and what was left of the crops became a feast for an invasion of grasshoppers.

===Decline of La Réunion===
Although more than 350 European colonists eventually made La Réunion their home, the experiment was already beginning to fail as the population began to leave. Some returned to Europe while others  moved out of the area. In 1860 the nearby emerging town of Dallas incorporated La Réunion into its land area; the remaining skilled colonists were absorbed into its specialized workers.

==Few reminders remain==
Eventually what had been cultivated as farmland at La Réunion was discovered to be covering large deposits of limestone; it was gradually quarried and transported to build the growing state of Texas. The cemetery on the old colony site still serves as the final resting place for some of the colonists.  It is maintained by the City of Dallas and is located ({{coord|32.7835|-96.8604|format=dms|type:landmark|display=title,inline}}) just off Fish Trap Road between Singleton Blvd and the Trinity River in west Dallas.  The [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] placed a small memorial to the colony at a nearby golf course. The last La Réunion house collapsed in the 1930s, and its ruins are now obscured by thick vegetation. [[Reunion Tower]], a Dallas landmark, was named after the colony and is located a few miles east of where La Réunion once existed.

===Legacy===
Shortly before the demise of La Réunion, botanist and pharmacist [[Jacob Boll]] arrived and taught [[Julien Reverchon]].  The latter man became celebrated in his own right as a professor of botany at [[Baylor University|Baylor University College of Medicine and Pharmacy]] in Dallas. The first brewery and butcher shops in Dallas were established by former colonists from La Réunion; [[Maxime Guillot]] opened a carriage factory that operated for 50 years, helping to make Dallas the world center of the carriage and harness-making industries by 1900.
