{{Elections}}
An '''election exit poll''' is a poll of voters taken immediately after they have exited the polling stations. Unlike an [[opinion poll]], which asks whom the voter plans to vote for or some similar formulation, an exit poll asks whom the voter actually voted for. A similar poll conducted before actual voters have voted is called an [[entrance poll]]. Pollsters – usually private companies working for [[newspaper]]s or broadcasters – conduct exit polls to gain an early indication as to how an election has turned out, as in many elections the actual result may take hours or even days to count.

[[Warren Mitofsky]], founder of Mitofsky International, is credited with having invented the exit poll.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Moore, Senior Gallup Poll Editor, “New Exit Poll Consortium Vindication for Exit Poll Inventor,” Gallup News Service, October 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[Image:HK Sunday 2008 Lego Election Polling Station Sai Ying Pun Third Street 2 a.jpg|thumb|left|An exit poll during [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|an election]] in Hong Kong]]
Exit polls are also used to collect [[demographics|demographic]] data about voters and to find out why they voted as they did. Since actual votes are cast anonymously, polling is the only way of collecting this information.

Exit polls have historically and throughout the world been used as a [[Election verification exit poll|check against and rough indicator]] of the degree of [[election fraud]]. Some examples of this include the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004]], and the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004]].

==Problems==
Like all opinion polls, exit polls by nature do include a [[margin of error]]. A famous example of exit poll error occurred in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK General Election]], when two exit polls predicted a [[hung parliament]]. The actual vote revealed that [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Government under [[John Major]] held their position, though with a significantly reduced majority. Investigations into this failure identified a number of causes including differential response rates (the [[Shy Tory Factor]]), the use of inadequate demographic data and poor choice of sampling points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |author=Market Research Society|publisher=Market Research Society|place=London|date=1994|title=The Opinion Polls and the 1992 Election: a Report to the Market Research Society |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Clive |last=Payne |title=Election Forecasting in the UK |date=2001-11-28 |url=http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/Politics/papers/2002/w8/forecast.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that conduct election exit polling==
{{globalise-section|date=December 2010}}
In the United States, the [[National Election Pool]] (NEP) consists of ABC, AP, CBS, CNN, FOX News, and NBC conduct a joint election exit poll.  Since 2004 this exit poll has been conducted for the NEP by Edison Media Research.

The release of exit poll data in the US has been met with increased scrutiny in recent years. In  the 2012 election protocols to quarantine the release of data were put in place. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/194410/exit-poll-data-will-be-examined-in-quarantine-room/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
Widespread criticism of exit polling has occurred in cases, especially in the [[United States]], where exit-poll results have appeared and/or have provided a basis for projecting winners before all real polls have closed, thereby possibly influencing election results.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 U.S. presidential election]], NBC predicted a victory for Ronald Reagan at 8:15 pm EST, based on exit polls of 20,000 voters. It was 5:15 pm on the West Coast, and the polls were still open. There was speculation that voters stayed away after hearing the results.&lt;ref&gt;Facts on File Yearbook 1980 p865&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, television networks have voluntarily adopted the policy of not projecting any victor within a state until all polls have closed for that state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential election]] it was alleged that media organizations released exit poll results for [[Florida]] before the polls closed in the Florida panhandle, as part of the westernmost area of the state is 1 hour behind the main peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Germany]], have made it a criminal offence to release exit poll figures before the polling stations have closed, while others, such as  [[Singapore]], have banned them altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.article19.org/pdfs/publications/opinion-polls-paper.pdf Comparative study of laws and regulations restricting the publication of electoral opinion polls], Article 19 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, problems with exit polls have encouraged polling groups to pool data in hopes of increased accuracy. This proved successful during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK General Election]], when the [[BBC]] and [[ITV]] merged their data to show an exit poll giving [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] a majority of 66 seats, which turned out to be the exact figure. This method was also successful in the [[2007 Australian Federal Election]], where the collaboration of [[Sky News Australia|Sky News]], [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] and [[Auspoll]] provided an almost exact 53 percent two party-preferred victory to [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] over the ruling [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].
