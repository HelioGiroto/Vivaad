'''Mass mobilization''' (also known as '''social mobilization''' or '''popular mobilization''') refers to [[mobilization]] of [[civilian]] [[population]] as part of [[contentious politics]]. Mass mobilization is often used by [[grassroot]]s-based [[social movements]], including [[revolutionary movement]]s, but can also become a tool of [[elite]]s and the [[State (polity)|state]] itself. The process usually takes the form of large public [[gathering]]s such as [[mass meetings]], marches, [[parade]]s, [[procession]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]. Those gatherings usually are part of a [[protest|protest action]].

Mass mobilization is defined as a process that engages and motivates a wide range of partners and allies at national and local levels to raise awareness of and demand for a particular development objective through face-to-face dialogue. Members of institutions, community networks, civic and religious groups and others work in a coordinated way to reach specific groups of people for dialogue with planned messages. In other words, social mobilization seeks to facilitate change through a range of players engaged in interrelated and complementary efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot; /&gt;

==Government mass mobilization==
Governments can utilize mass mobilization to provide national support for the causes they are working for.  Many governments attempt to mobilize the population to participate in elections and other voting events.  In particular, it is important for political parties in any country to be able to mobilize voters in order to gain support for their party, which affects voter turnout in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname5&quot; /&gt;

===Examples===
Nazi Germany applied mass mobilization techniques to win support for the fascist regime.  The Nazi party mobilized the population with mass meetings, parades, and other gatherings.  These events appealed to the people's emotion to cause patriotic fanaticism for the fascist cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname4&quot; /&gt;

==Mass mobilization in social media==
Social Media and the internet have made mass mobilization easier to organize and disseminate ideas.  The internet has grown in political importance, and has played a significant role in many mass mobilization efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname2&quot; /&gt;

====Arab Spring====
{{main|Arab Spring}}
The '''Arab Spring''' is a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s occurring in the [[Arab world]] that began on Saturday, 18 December 2010.

The protests have shared techniques of mostly [[civil resistance]] in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, rallies, as well as the use of [[social media]] to organize, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of state attempts at repression and [[Internet censorship]].&lt;ref name = cascading&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/|title=The Arab Uprising's Cascading Effects|publisher=Miller-mccune.com|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonviolence vs Violent Tactics==
According to [[Donatella della Porta]] and [[Sidney Tarrow]], the mechanism that produces violence in the declining phase of the collective action cycle is a result of the competition that arises among different sectors of the social movement. Together they formed a theory stating that as mass mobilization winds down, political violence rises in magnitude and intensity.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname26&quot; /&gt;

===Examples===

====Italy====
In his study of the wave of mass protests that took place in Italy between 1965 and 1975, [[Sidney Tarrow]] stated that “[i]n the final stages of the cycle, there was an increase in the deliberate use of violence against others. But this increase was a function of the decline of mass protest, not of its extension. Indeed, deliberate targeted violence did not become common until 1972-3, when all the other forms of collective action had declined.” All of which leads him to forcefully conclude that “[o]rganized violence was the product of demobilization.” &lt;ref name=&quot;refname27&quot; /&gt;
[[Donatella della Porta]], in her comparative analysis of political 
violence and cycles of protest in Italy and Germany between 1960 and 1990, maintains 
that “when mass mobilization declined, the movements went back to more institutional 
forms of collective action, whereas small groups resorted to more organized forms of 
violence.” &lt;ref name=&quot;refname28&quot; /&gt;

====USSR====
Mark R. Beissinger, in his study on cycles of protest and 
nationalist violence in the Soviet Union between 1987 and 1992, also detects this 
pattern, but in this case violence takes the form of ethnic communal conflict rather than 
terrorism. As he says, “the rise of violence in the USSR in significant part was 
associated with the decline of nonviolent mobilization contesting interrepublican 
borders.” &lt;ref name=&quot;refname29&quot; /&gt;

====Russia====
During the 1870s, the “populists” or “[[nihilists]]”, the proponents of a Russian variant of [[anarchism]], organized the so-called 
“pilgrimages to the people”, which involved small groups of members of the urban, petit bourgeois intelligentsia going into small villages to persuade peasants of the
necessity of revolution. However, their efforts had little effect on the peasantry, and it was after this bitter experience that they made the momentous decision to adopt terrorist 
tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname30&quot; /&gt;

====Hamas====
[[Hamas]] was created in 1987, coinciding with the start of the [[First Intifada]] in the occupied territories. Hamas was the Palestinian wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and it started out as a religious, social and political movement with no involvement in violence. During the Intifada, Hamas challenged the political monopoly of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO). Its first violent actions occurred in early 1989, but were sporadic and did not amount to an armed campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname31&quot; /&gt;

In fact, its military or terrorist branch, the [[al-Qassam Brigades]], was not created until 1992. The standard explanation in the literature for Hamas’ eventual 
involvement in terrorism mentions the attempt to block the peace negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Ultimately, violence was instrumental in the competition between nationalist and Islamist organizations for representation of the Palestinian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname32&quot; /&gt;

Mass demonstrations occurred mainly during the first year of the revolt. Afterwards, most actions consisted of stone-throwing, strikes, and commercial boycotts. In the end, only the more militant hard-core was involved in these activities. There are grounds, therefore, to assert that in the case of Hamas, terrorist violence was employed at the end of the cycle of mobilization of the Intifada. Although it cannot be denied that many other factors may have played a role, it is clear that terrorism only erupted when the social movement was exhausted.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname26&quot; /&gt;
