{{voting}}
'''Abstention''' is a term in [[election]] procedure for when a participant in a vote either does not go to vote (on election day) or, in [[parliamentary procedure]], is present during the vote, but does not cast a ballot. Abstention must be contrasted with &quot;[[blank vote]]&quot;, in which a voter casts a ballot willfully made invalid by marking it wrongly or by not marking anything at all. A &quot;blank (or white) voter&quot; has voted, although his vote may be considered a [[spoilt vote]], depending on each legislation, while an abstaining voter hasn't voted. Both forms (abstention and blank vote) may or may not, depending on the circumstances, be considered as [[protest vote]].

An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might be not be politically expedient to vote according to his or her conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or has not participated in relevant discussion. In parliamentary procedure, a member may be required to abstain in the case of a real or perceived [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/politics/20obama.html?pagewanted=1 | work=New York Times | first= Raymond and Christopher Drew | last=Hernandez | title=It’s Not Just ‘Ayes’ and ‘Nays’: Obama’s Votes in Illinois Echo | date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstentions do not count in tallying the vote negatively or positively; when members abstain, they are in effect attending only to contribute to a [[quorum]]. White votes, however, may be counted in the total of votes, depending on the legislation.

==Active abstention==

An active abstention can occur where a voter votes in a way that balances out their vote as if they had never voted. This has occurred many times in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. During a division (a process where a yes/no vote occurs to agree or disagree to a motion), a [[Member of Parliament]] may actively abstain by voting both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. This is effectively the same as not voting at all, as the outcome will not be changed by the active abstention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/boths.php Voted both aye and no] - from [[The Public Whip]]. Published 24 April 2012 and retrieved 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However in the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom]], active abstention is not possible as a Lord voting both ways will be removed from the list of votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordsoftheblog.net/2011/02/10/recording-abstentions/ Recording Abstentions] by [[Philip Norton, Baron Norton of Louth|Lord Norton]], from lordsoftheblog.net. Published 20 February 2011 and retrieved 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another manner, an intentionally [[spoilt vote]] could be interpreted as an active abstention. This is where a voter turns up to an election and invalidates the ballot paper in some way. Because of the nature of an abstention, only intentionally spoiled ballots could be counted as an active abstention.

==International and national procedures==
[[File:Canadaelections2011.png|thumb|Comparative results of [[Canadian federal election, 2011|Canadian federal election]] with or without abstention]]
In the [[United Nations Security Council]], representatives of the five countries holding a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] power (the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]) sometimes abstain rather than vetoing a measure about which they are less than enthusiastic, particularly if the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|measure]] otherwise has broad support. By convention, their abstention does not block the measure, despite the wording of Article 27.3 of the [[United Nations Charter]]. If a majority of members of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] or one of its [[United Nations General Assembly#Subsidiary organs|committees]] abstain on a measure, then the measure fails.

In the [[Council of the European Union]], an abstention on a matter decided by unanimity has the effect of a ''yes'' vote; on matters decided by [[qualified majority]] it has an effect of a ''no'' vote.

In the [[United States House of Representatives]] and many other legislatures, members may vote &quot;present&quot; rather than for or against a bill or resolution, which has the effect of an abstention.

In the [[United States Senate]], the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer]] calls each Senator's name alphabetically, and, if abstaining, the Senator must give a reason for the abstention. Members may decline to vote, in committee or on the floor, on any matter which he or she believes would be a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXII |title=Voting Procedure |publisher=Rules of the United States Senate |accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstention campaigns==

There have been a number of instances around the world where popular movements have boycotted elections.

In [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of abstention campaigns that make the structural argument that no political party truly represents the poor. The &quot;[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]&quot; Campaign which was started by the [[Landless Peoples Movement]] in 2004, is the largest of such campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

No Vote!| publisher=Anti-Eviction Campaign|date =2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These campaigns have been met with significant repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abahlali.org/node/865|title=&quot;No Vote&quot; Campaigns are not a Rejection of Democracy|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a human rights activist was convicted in Belarus for calling not to participate in the local elections he considered to be undemocratic. In 2004, UN Human Rights Committee has found the conviction to violate freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/html/927-2000.html UN HRC views in case Svetik v. Belarus, CCPR/C/81/D/927/2000], 2004 &lt;!-- http://www.bayefsky.com/pdf/belarus_t5_iccpr_927_2000.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other social movements and civil society organisations in other parts of the world also have similar campaigns or non-voting preferences. These include the [[Naxalites]] in India, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico and various [[anarchist]] and [[left communism|left communist]] oriented movements. In Mexico's mid term 2009 elections there was strong support for 'Nulo' - a campaign to vote for no one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/world/americas/21mexico.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss 'New York Times' Disgruntled Mexicans Plan an Election Message to Politicians: We Prefer Nobody]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votaenblanco.org.mx/ Vota en Blanco]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narconews.com/Issue57/article3561.html 'Representative Democracy versus Participatory Democracy' by Nancy Davis, Narco News, 21 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In India poor people's in movements Singur, Nandigram and Lalgarh have rejected parliamentary politics (as well as the NGO and Maoist alternatives).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/No-revolution-for-old-radicals/articleshow/4681964.cms No revolution for old radicals, 'Times of India', 21 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been no vote campaigns in Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://boycottelections2011.blogspot.com/2011/04/why-i-dont-endorse-voting-in-may-2nd.html Why I Don't Endorse Voting in the May 2nd Elections], by Rowland Túpac Keshena, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.

In September 2011, the ''New York Times'' argued that there was a growing &quot;scorn for voting&quot; around the world.&lt;ref&gt;/[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/world/as-scorn-for-vote-grows-protests-surge-around-globe.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=global-home As Scorn for Vote Grows, Protests Surge Around Globe], NICHOLAS KULISH, September 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
