'''Republican In Name Only''' is a [[pejorative]] term that refers to a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] of the [[United States]] whose political views or actions are considered insufficiently [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or otherwise conforming to liberal positions. The acronym '''''RINO''''', emerging in the 1990s, is a charge used in campaigns by Republican conservatives against party moderates and liberals.

==Origins==
In 1912, former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], then-President [[William Howard Taft]], and Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] fought for ideological control of the Republican Party and each denounced the other two as &quot;not really Republican&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The phrase ''Republican in name only'' emerged as a popular political [[pejorative]] in the 1920s, 1950s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popik&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=RINO (Republican In Name Only) |url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/rino_republican_in_name_only |last=Popik |first=Barry |work=Big Apple Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known print appearance of the term ''RINO'' was in the [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] newspaper then called ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|The Union Leader]]''.&lt;!-- It was called &quot;The Union Leader&quot; until 2005. --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wordspy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/rino.asp |title=RINO |work=Word spy |last=McFedries |first=Paul |publisher=Logophilia Limited |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote |Bill Clinton would have been proud of what was happening on the third-floor Senate corner at the State House this week....

==Usage==
During Republican [[Primary election|primary campaign]] season, some conservative organizations classify as ''RINO'''s Republicans who fail to adopt their right-wing stances. [[National Federation of Republican Assemblies]] started the &quot;RINO Hunters' Club&quot;, which targets candidates soft on taxes, gun rights, and abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannibals&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agenceglobal.com/article.asp?id=221 |title=Republican Cannibals: Hunting for RINOs |date=27 August 2004 |publisher=[[The Nation]] |work=Agence Global |last=Nichols |first=John |authorlink=John Nichols (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-tax group [[Club for Growth]] (which supports the National Federation of Republican Assemblies) invented the &quot;RINO Watch&quot; list to monitor &quot;Republican office holders around the nation who have advanced egregious anti-growth, anti-freedom or anti-free market policies&quot;; other conservative groups published similar lists.

==Similar terms==
While the term ''RINO'' is of recent coinage, the concept of being an inauthentic member of the Republican Party by not representing its more conservative faction is a recurring theme in Party history.

===Me-too Republicans===
In the 1930s and 40s, ''Me-too Republicans'' described those who ran on a platform of agreeing with the Democratic Party, proclaiming only minor or moderating differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspense, contrast missing in election countdown  |last=Shapiro |first=Walter |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/shapiro/2002-10-29-hype_x.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date= 29 October 2002|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Assessing Last Week's Column |url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=17702 |last=Blankley |first=Tony |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |publisher=[[Human Events]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is two-time presidential candidate [[Thomas E. Dewey]], who ran against the popular [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his successor [[Harry Truman]]. Dewey did not oppose Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] programs altogether, but merely campaigned on the promise that Republicans would run them more efficiently and less corruptly.&lt;!-- Still needs an example of someone calling Dewey a &quot;Me-too Republican&quot;. --&gt;

But we do not like the way the president's administration is doing them.  Just turn them over to us.&quot; |[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ({{abbr|D|Democrat}}) |addressing a Democratic audience in New York, September 1936&lt;ref name=&quot;optimists&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Roosevelt and Reagan: Eternal Optimists |url=http://www.gvsu.edu/hauenstein/?id=C0CA7C53-F153-5D40-EF3F207BB2A677F2&amp;CFID=9282716&amp;CFTOKEN=68294622 |first=Richard Norton |last=Smith |publisher=[[Gleaves Whitney#Hauenstein_Center_for_Presidential_Studies|Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies]] |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1936 to 1976, the more [[centrist]] members of the Republican Party frequently won the national nomination with candidates such as [[Alf Landon]], [[Wendell Willkie]], [[Thomas E. Dewey]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Gerald Ford]]. The mainstream of the Republican Party was generally supportive of the [[New Deal]], and the [[right wing]] was the more marginalized faction. In the 1950s, conservatives such as [[Robert Taft]] and [[Barry Goldwater]], who rallied against &quot;me-too Republicans&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;farewell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962804,00.html |title=Farewell to a Quartet of Kings of the Hill |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time, Inc.]] |date=10 November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; were considered outside of the mainstream of the then-centrist GOP; serious consideration was given to leaving the GOP and forming a new conservative party in cooperation with conservative Democrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perlstein&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |title=Before the Storm |date=21 March 2001 |publisher=[[Hill and Wang]] |isbn=978-0-8090-2859-7 |page= 13 |quote=... the recipe for a new conservative party was plain: one part Midwestern Taft Republican, one part Southern states' rights Democrat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nixonians, and Rockefeller Republicans===
In the 1960s and 70s, conservatives sometimes called moderate Republicans ''[[Nixonian]]''. A more widely adopted term was ''[[Rockefeller Republican]]''. Neither expression was always considered pejorative.
