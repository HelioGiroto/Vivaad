'''Neoconservatism''' is a [[right-wing]] branch of American [[liberalism]] that espouse political individualism and a qualified endorsement of [[free market]]s. It has also been described as an variant of  [[conservatism]]  which advocates the assertive promotion of  [[democracy]] and [[United States]] national interest in international affairs including through military means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1075556/neoconservatism] ''Britannica - Academic Edition''.

Accessed: 11 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoconservatism (or new conservatism) is rooted in a group of former liberals, who in the late 1960s, began to embrace [[nationalism]] and [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] in opposition to the rise of the USSR and moved significantly to the right of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neoconservative]''www.merriam-webster.com/''.

==Terminology==
[[File:Irving Kristol.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|[[Irving Kristol]] was called &quot;godfather&quot; of neoconservatism]]
The term &quot;neoconservative&quot;  was popularized in the United States in 1973 by Socialist leader [[Michael Harrington]], who used the term to define [[Daniel Bell]], [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], and  [[Irving Kristol]], whose ideologies differed from Harrington's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Michael |last=Harrington |title=The Welfare State and Its Neoconservative Critics |journal=[[Dissent (magazine)|Dissent]] |date=Fall 1973 |volume=20|ref=harv

Earlier in 1973 he had sketched out some of the same ideas in a brief contribution to a symposium on welfare sponsored by ''Commentary'', &quot;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/Nixon-the-Great-Society-and-the-Future-of-Social-PolicyA-Symposium-5214 Nixon, the Great Society, and the Future of Social Policy]&quot;, ''Commentary'' 55 (May 1973), p.39 |year=2000 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;neoconservative&quot; label was embraced by [[Irving Kristol]] in his 1979 article &quot;Confessions of a True, Self-Confessed 'Neoconservative.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot;/&gt; His ideas have been influential since the 1950s, when he co-founded and edited ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another source was [[Norman Podhoretz]], editor of ''[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]'' magazine from 1960 to 1995. By 1982 Podhoretz was calling himself a neoconservative, in a ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' article titled &quot;The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan's Foreign Policy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerson_PR&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the neoconservatives were driven by &quot;the notion that liberalism&quot; had failed and &quot;no longer knew what it was talking about, &quot; according to [[E. J. Dionne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dionne&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=E.J. |last=Dionne |year=1991 |authorlink=E. J.

==History==

[[File:HenryJackson.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Senator [[Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson]], inspiration for neoconservative foreign policy in 1970s]]

Through the 1950s and early 1960s the future neoconservatives had supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], [[racial integration|integration]], and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9605/opinion/thistime.html |first=James |last=Nuechterlein |title=The End of Neoconservatism |journal=[[First Things]] |volume=63 |month=May |year=1996 |pages=14–15 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |quote=Neoconservatives differed with traditional conservatives on a number of issues, of which the three most important, in my view, were the New Deal, civil rights, and the nature of the Communist threat... On civil rights, all neocons were enthusiastic supporters of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Acts]] of 1964 and 1965.&quot;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s to the 1960s, there was broad support among liberals to support military action to prevent a communist victory in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Tomes, ''Apocalypse Then: American Intellectuals and the Vietnam War, 1954-1975'' (2000) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoconservatism was triggered by the repudiation of [[coalition politics]] by the American [[New Left]]: [[Black Power]], which denounced coalition-politics and [[racial integration]] as &quot;selling out&quot; and &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]ism&quot; and which frequently gave rise to [[anti-semitic]] outbursts, [[anti-communism|anti-anticommunism]], which seemed indifferent to the fate of Southern Vietnam, and which in the late 1960s included substantial support for [[Marxist Leninist]] movements, and the &quot;[[new politics]]&quot; of the [[New left]], which upheld students and alienated minorities as the agents of social change (replacing the majority of the population and the labor movement).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Balint, ''Running Commentary: The Contentious Magazine That Transformed the Jewish Left Into the Neoconservative Right'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Irving Kristol]] edited the journal ''[[The Public Interest]]'' (1965–2005), featuring economists and political scientists, focused on ways that government planning in the liberal state had produced unintended harmful consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol, &quot;Forty good years,&quot; ''Public Interest,'' Spring 2005, Issue 159, pp 5-11 is Kristol's retrospective in the final issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Podhoretz's magazine ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' of the [[American Jewish Committee]], originally a journal of the liberal left, became a major voice for neoconservatives in the 1970s.
''Commentary'' published an article by Jeane Kirkpatrick, an early and prototypical neoconservative, albeit not a New Yorker.

[[image:Od jeane-kirkpatrick-official-portrait 1-255x301.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

The theoretical framework for neoconservative foreign policy during the final years of the Cold War was articulated by [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], in &quot;[[Dictatorships and Double Standards]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeane Kirkpatrick, J (November 1979). &quot;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/dictatorships--double-standards-6189 Dictatorships and Double Standards],&quot; ''Commentary Magazine'' Volume '''68'', No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; published in ''[[Commentary Magazine]]'' in November 1979. Kirkpatrick criticized the foreign policy of [[Jimmy Carter]], which supported [[detente]] with the Soviet Union. She went on to serve the Reagan Administration as Ambassador to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Noah, T. (Dec. 8, 200).

====Skepticism towards democracy promotion====
In &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards,&quot; Kirkpatrick distinguished  between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union; she suggested that in some countries democracy was not tenable and the U.S. faced a choice between supporting authoritarian governments, which might evolve into democracies, or Marxist-Leninist regimes, which she argued had never been dislodged once they achieved totalitarian control. In such tragic circumstances, she argued that allying with authoritarian governments might be prudent. Kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally [[autocrat]]ic countries, the Carter administration  had delivered those countries to Marxist-Leninists that were even more repressive. She further accused the administration of a &quot;double standard&quot;, of never having applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to [[Communist government]]s. The essay compares traditional autocracies and Communist regimes:

:&quot;[Traditional autocrats] do not disturb the habitual rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal relations. Because the miseries of traditional life are familiar, they are bearable to ordinary people who, growing up in the society, learn to cope&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot;

:&quot;[Revolutionary Communist regimes] claim jurisdiction over the whole life of the society and make demands for change that so violate internalized values and habits that inhabitants flee by the tens of thousands&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot;

Kirkpatrick concluded that while the United States should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries, it should not do so when the government is facing violent overthrow, and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nprkirkpatrick&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits. In Britain, the road [to democratic government] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|took seven centuries to traverse]]... &lt;!-- The speed with which armies collapse, bureaucracies abdicate, and social structures dissolve once the authocrat is removed frequently surprises American policymakers. --&gt;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;econkirkpatrick&quot;&gt;{{cite news

{{anchor|Poland}}
;Poland
Before 1982, neoconservatives were skeptical about [[democracy promotion]] and criticized the prudence of the Carter administrations policies on [[human rights]]. Kirkpatrick and  [[Norman Podhoretz]] before 1982 argued that communism could not be overthrown and that the Polish labor-union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] was doomed. Podhoretz  and Kirkpatrick were originally skeptical about the AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity and about the use of U.S. economic aid to promote liberalization and democratization in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;

===New York Intellectuals===
Many neoconservatives had been on the left  in the 1930s and 1940s, where they opposed Stalinism. After WWII, they continued to oppose Stalinism and to support democracy during the [[Cold War]].  Of these, many  were   emerged from Jewish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryAmerican/Since1945/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195036626 Oxford University Press about the Progidal Sons book]: &quot;...that it's easy to forget that most grew up onthe edge of American society--poor, Jewish, the children of immigrants.

====Michael Lind's view====

[[Michael Lind]] wrote:
{{quote|&quot;Most neoconservative defense intellectuals have their roots on the left, not the right. They are products of the influential Jewish-American sector of the Trotskyist movement of the 1930s and 1940s, which morphed into anti-communist liberalism between the 1950s and 1970s and finally into a kind of militaristic and imperial right with no precedents in American culture or political history. Their admiration for the Israeli Likud party's tactics, including preventive warfare such as Israel's 1981 raid on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor, is mixed with odd bursts of ideological enthusiasm for &quot;democracy.&quot; They call their revolutionary ideology &quot;Wilsonianism&quot; (after President Woodrow Wilson), but it is really Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution mingled with the far-right Likud strain of Zionism. Genuine American Wilsonians believe in self-determination for people such as the Palestinians.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The major link between the conservative think tanks and the Israel lobby is the Washington-based and Likud-supporting Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa), which co-opts many non-Jewish defense experts by sending them on trips to Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lind|Lind, Michael]]. &quot;[http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2003/04/09/neocons/index.html How Neoconservatives Conquered Washington]&quot;, ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', April 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most were socialists, social-democrats, or liberal Democrats into the 1960s, when they were confronted with the [[New Left]] and rethought their positions. Many supported Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], a liberal Democrat in domestic affairs who criticized the human-rights violations of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaufman, ''Henry M. Jackson: a life in politics'' (2000) p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejecting the American New Left and McGovern's New Politics===
Kirkpatrick's political evolution was similar to those of other socialists, social-democrats, and liberals who became neoconservatives. They rejected the [[counterculture]] of the 1960s [[New Left]], and what they saw as [[anti-Americanism]] in the [[non-interventionism]] of the movement against the [[Vietnam War]].  When the anti-war element took control of the party in 1972 and nominated [[George McGovern]], the Democrats among them followed the lead of Washington Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Jackson]] and revolted. Historian Justin Vaïsse calls this the &quot;Second Age&quot; of Neoconservatism, with its emphasis on the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Vaïsse, ''Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement'' (2010) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

As the policies of the New Left pushed the Democrats to the Left, these intellectuals became disillusioned with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] domestic programs. The influential 1970 bestseller ''[[The Real Majority]]'' by [[Ben Wattenberg]] expressed that the &quot;real majority&quot; of the electorate supported economic liberalism but social conservatism, and warned Democrats it could be disastrous to take liberal stances on certain social and crime issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Richard Nixon and the Quest for a New Majority|author=Mason, Robert|year=2004|publisher=[[UNC Press]]|isbn=0-8078-2905-6|pages=81–88|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nlag8VcyEd4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many supported Democratic senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson]] in his unsuccessful 1972 and 1976 campaigns for president. Among those who worked for Jackson were future neoconservatives [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Doug Feith]], and [[Richard Perle]]. In the late 1970s neoconservative support moved to [[Ronald Reagan]], the Republican hawk who promised to confront Soviet expansionism.

The fact that most of the younger neocons were never on the left is irrelevant; they are the intellectual (and, in the case of [[William Kristol]] and [[John Podhoretz]], the literal) heirs of older ex-leftists.}}

===Leo Strauss and his students===
Neoconservatism draws on several intellectual traditions. The students of political science Professor [[Leo Strauss]] (1899–1973) comprised one major group. Eugene Sheppard notes that, &quot;Much scholarship tends to understand Strauss as an inspirational founder of American neoconservatism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene R. Sheppard, ''Leo Strauss and the politics of exile: the making of a political philosopher'' (2005) p 1&lt;/ref&gt;   Strauss was a refugee from Nazi Germany who taught at the New School for Social Research in New York (1939–49) and the University of Chicago (1949–1958).&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bloom, &quot;Leo Strauss: September 20, 1899-October 18, 1973,&quot; ''Political Theory,'' November 1974, Vol. 2 Issue 4, pp 372-392, an obituary and appreciation by one of his prominent students&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss asserted that &quot;the crisis of the West consists in the West's having become uncertain of its purpose.&quot; Resolution lay in a restoration of the vital ideas and faith that in the past had sustained the moral purpose of the West. Classical Greek political philosophy and the Judeo-Christian heritage are the pillars of the Great Tradition in Strauss's work.&lt;ref&gt;John P. East, &quot;Leo Strauss and American Conservatism,&quot; [http://www.mmisi.org/ma/21_01/east.pdf ''Modern Age,'' Winter 1977, Vol. 21 Issue 1, pp 2-19 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss laid great emphasis on spirit of the Greek classics, and West (1991) argues that for Strauss the American Founding Fathers were correct in their understanding of the classics in their principles of justice. For Strauss, political community is defined by convictions about justice and happiness rather than by sovereignty and force. He repudiated the philosophy of [[John Locke]] as a bridge to 20th-century historicism and nihilism, and defended liberal democracy as closer to the spirit of the classics than other modern regimes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} For Strauss, the American awareness of ineradicable evil in human nature, and hence the need for morality, was a beneficial outgrowth of the premodern Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. West, &quot;Leo Strauss and the American Founding,&quot; ''Review of Politics,'' Winter 1991, Vol. 53 Issue 1, pp 157-172&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill (2009) notes that Strauss wrote little about American topics but his students wrote a great deal, and that Strauss's influence led his students to reject historicism and positivism. Instead they promoted an Aristotelian perspective on America that produced a qualified defense of its liberal constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Johnathan O'Neill, &quot;Straussian constitutional history and the Straussian political project,&quot; ''Rethinking History,'' December 2009, Vol. 13 Issue 4, pp 459-478&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss influenced  ''Weekly Standard'' editor [[William Kristol]], editor [[John Podhoretz]], and military strategist [[Paul Wolfowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry F. Seidman and Neil J. Murphy, eds. ''Toward a new political humanism'' (2004) p 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, ''Leo Strauss and the politics of exile: the making of a political philosopher'' (2005) pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
During the 1990s, neoconservatives were once again in the opposition side of the foreign policy establishment, both under the Republican Administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] and that of his Democratic successor, President [[Bill Clinton]]. Many critics charged that the neoconservatives lost their influence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Martin |last=Jaques |title=America faces a future of managing imperial decline |date=2006-11-16 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1948806,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was galvanized by the decision of George H. W. Bush and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] General [[Colin Powell]] to leave [[Saddam Hussein]] in power after the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991. Many neoconservatives viewed this policy, and the decision not to support indigenous dissident groups such as the [[Kurds]] and [[Shiites]] in their [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991-1992 resistance]] to Hussein, as a betrayal of democratic principles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Ironically, some of those same targets of criticism would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies. In 1992, referring to the first [[Gulf War]], then [[United States Secretary of Defense]] and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] said:
{{quote|I would guess if we had gone in there, I would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home....

And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties is Saddam [Hussein] worth? And the answer is not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the president made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Charles|last= Pope|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Cheney changed his view on Iraq|url= http://www.seattlepi.com/national/192908_cheney29.html|work= |publisher= Seattle Post Intelligencer|date= 2008-09-29|accessdate=2008-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Within a few years of the Gulf War in [[Iraq]], many neoconservatives were pushing to oust Saddam Hussein. On February 19, 1998, an open letter to President Clinton appeared, signed by dozens of pundits, many identified with neoconservatism and, later, related groups such as the [[PNAC]], urging decisive action to remove Saddam from power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Solarz|Solarz, Stephen]], et al. &quot;[http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/rumsfeld-openletter.htm Open Letter to the President]&quot;, February 19, 1998, online at IraqWatch.org. Retrieved September 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoconservatives were also members of the [[Blue Team (U.S. politics)|blue team]], which argued for a confrontational policy toward the [[People's Republic of China]] and strong military and diplomatic support for [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].

In the late 1990s Irving Kristol and other writers in neoconservative magazines began touting anti-Darwinist views, in support of [[intelligent design]]. Since these neoconservatives were largely of secular backgrounds, a few commentators have speculated that this{{spaced ndash}}along with support for religion generally{{spaced ndash}}may have been a case of a &quot;noble lie&quot;, intended to protect public morality, or even [[tactical politics]], to attract religious supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/30329.html |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |title=Origin of the Specious |first=Ronald |last=Bailey |month=July |year=1997 |accessdate=2008-03-31|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

====Administration of George W. Bush====

{{Wikinews|Vanity Fair editor Craig Unger on the Bush family feud, neoconservatives and the Christian right}}
The Bush campaign and the early Bush administration did not exhibit strong support for neoconservative principles. As a presidential candidate, Bush had argued for a restrained foreign policy, stating his opposition to the idea of ''[[nation-building]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/helenthomas/2117601/detail.html |title=Bush Begins Nation Building |publisher=WCVB TV |date=2003-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early foreign policy confrontation with China was handled without the vociferousness suggested by some neoconservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/4/6/194726.shtml |title=China Plane Incident Sparks Re-election Drives of Security-minded Senators |first=Wes |last=Vernon |work=Newsmax |date=2001-04-07 |accessdate=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also early in the administration, some neoconservatives criticized Bush's administration as insufficiently supportive of [[Israel]], and suggested Bush's foreign policies were not substantially different from those of President Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/06/27/wbush27.xml |title=Bush accused of adopting Clinton policy on Israel |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2001-06-26 |accessdate=2008-03-30 | location=London | first1=Toby | last1=Harnden | first2=Alan | last2=Philps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush]] with the (at that time) [[President of Egypt]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] at [[Camp David]] in 2002. In November 2010, Bush wrote in his memoir ''[[Decision Points]]'' claiming Mubarak supported the administration's position that [[Iraq]] had WMDs in the lead up to the war with the country, but kept it private for fear of &quot;inciting the Arab street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/12/arabs_leaders_and_arab_street &quot;Bush: Mubarak wanted me to invade Iraq&quot;], Mohammad Sagha. Foreign Policy. November 12, 2010. Accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bush's policies changed dramatically immediately after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]].

Bush laid out his vision of the future in his State of the Union speech in January 2002, following the September 11, 2001, attacks. The speech named Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as states that &quot;constitute an [[axis of evil]]&quot; and &quot;pose a grave and growing danger&quot;. Bush suggested the possibility of [[preemptive war]]: &quot;I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html The President's State of the Union Speech].&quot; White House press release, January  29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.observer.com/node/47005 Bush Speechwriter's Revealing Memoir Is Nerd's Revenge]&quot;. ''[[The New York Observer]],'' January  19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent defense and national-security personalities have been quite critical of what they believed was neoconservative influence in getting the United States to war with Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Porch, &quot;Writing History in the &quot;End of History&quot; Era--Reflections on Historians and the GWOT,&quot; '' Journal of Military History,'' October 2006, Vol. 70 Issue 4, pp 1065-1079&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nebraska]] Republican U.S. senator [[Chuck Hagel]], who has been critical of the Bush administration's adoption of neoconservative ideology, in his book ''America: Our Next Chapter'' wrote:
: &quot;So why did we invade Iraq? I believe it was the triumph of the so-called neo-conservative ideology, as well as Bush administration arrogance and incompetence that took America into this war of choice. . . . They obviously made a convincing case to a president with very limited national security and foreign policy experience, who keenly felt the burden of leading the nation in the wake of the deadliest terrorist attack ever on American soil.&quot;

=====Bush Doctrine=====
The ''[[Bush Doctrine]]'' of preemptive war was explicitly stated in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] text &quot;National Security Strategy of the United States,&quot; published September 20, 2002.
&quot;We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed . . . even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack... The United States will, if necessary, act preemptively.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html |title=National Security Strategy of the United States |publisher=National Security Council |date=2002-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice to not use the word 'preventive' in the 2002 National Security Strategy, and instead use the word 'preemptive' was largely in anticipation of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law, via both Charter Law and Customary Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-ir.info/?p=2303&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy analysts noted that the Bush Doctrine as stated in the 2002 NSC document bore a strong resemblance to recommendations originally presented in a controversial Defense Planning Guidance draft written in 1992 by [[Paul Wolfowitz]], under the first Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/cron.html The evolution of the Bush doctrine]&quot;, in &quot;The war behind closed doors&quot;. ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. February 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush Doctrine was greeted with accolades by many neoconservatives. When asked whether he agreed with the Bush Doctrine, [[Max Boot]] said he did, and that “I think [Bush is] exactly right to say we can’t sit back and wait for the next terrorist strike on Manhattan. We have to go out and stop the terrorists overseas. We have to play the role of the global policeman. . . . But I also argue that we ought to go further.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1000.html The Bush Doctrine].” “[[Think Tank (TV series)|Think Tank]],” [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. July 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Discussing the significance of the Bush Doctrine, neoconservative writer [[William Kristol]] claimed: “The world is a mess. And, I think, it’s very much to Bush’s credit that he's gotten serious about dealing with it. . . . The danger is not that we’re going to do too much. The danger is that we're going to do too little.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/themes/assess.html Assessing the Bush Doctrine]&quot;, in &quot;The war behind closed doors.&quot; ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]],'' [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. February 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 Presidential election and aftermath====
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}
[[John McCain]], who was the Republican candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States Presidential election]], supported continuing the [[Iraq War]], &quot;the issue that is most clearly identified with the neoconservatives&quot;. The ''New York Times'' further reported that his foreign policy views combined elements of neoconservative and the main competing view in conservative circles, [[political realism|pragmatism]], also called ''realism'':&lt;ref&gt;

[[Barack Obama]] campaigned for the Democratic nomination in 2008, by attacking his opponents, especially [[Hillary Clinton]], for originally supporting Bush's Iraq-war policies. He gave the impression he would reverse such policies. However, Obama adopted the main points of the Bush policy in Iraq, naming Clinton to the State Department and keeping [[Robert Gates]] (Bush's Defense Secretary), and [[David Petraeus]] (Bush's top general in Iraq), as well as implementing the Bush &quot;surge&quot; of military force. By 2010, U.S. forces had switched from combat to a training role in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen McGlinchey, &quot;Neoconservatism and American Foreign Policy&quot;, ''Politikon: The IAPSS Journal of Political Science,'' Vol 16, 1 (October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of views==

===Usage and general views===
In the early 1970s, Socialist [[Michael Harrington]] was one of the first to use &quot;neoconservative&quot; in its modern meaning. He characterized neoconservatives as former leftists{{spaced ndash}}whom he derided as &quot;socialists for [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]&quot;{{spaced ndash}}who had moved significantly to the right.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} These people tended to remain supporters of [[social democracy]], but distinguished themselves by allying with the Nixon administration over foreign policy, especially by their support for the Vietnam War and opposition to the Soviet Union. They still supported the ''[[welfare state]]'', but not necessarily in its contemporary form.

Irving Kristol remarked that a neoconservative is a &quot;{{Visible anchor|liberal mugged by reality}}&quot;, one who became more conservative after seeing the results of liberal policies. Kristol also distinguished three specific aspects of neoconservatism from previous forms of conservatism: neo-conservatives had a forward-looking approach drawn from their liberal heritage, rather than the reactionary and dour approach of previous conservatives; they had a meliorative outlook, proposing alternate reforms rather than simply attacking social liberal reforms; they took philosophical ideas and ideologies very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Kristol, Irving. &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_n121/ai_17489596/pg_5 American conservatism 1945-1995]&quot;. ''[[Public Interest]]'', Fall 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, at the close of President George W. Bush's second term in office, Jonathan Clarke, a senior fellow at the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], proposed the following as the &quot;main characteristics of neoconservatism&quot;: &quot;a tendency to see the world in binary good/evil terms&quot;, a &quot;low tolerance for diplomacy&quot;, a &quot;readiness to use military force&quot;, an &quot;emphasis on US unilateral action&quot;, a &quot;disdain for multilateral organizations&quot; and a &quot;focus on the Middle East&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7825039.stm &quot;Viewpoint: The end of the neocons?&quot;], Jonathan Clarke, [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], January 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on foreign policy===
{{International relations theory}}

In foreign policy, the neoconservatives' main concern is to prevent the arrival of a new rival. [[Defense Planning Guidance]], a document prepared in 1992 by Under Secretary for Defense for Policy [[Paul Wolfowitz]], is regarded by Distinguished Professor of the Humanities [[John McGowan (professor)|John McGowan]] at the [[University of North Carolina]] as the &quot;quintessential statement of neoconservative thought&quot;. The report says:&lt;ref name=&quot;McGowan&quot;/&gt;
:&quot;Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power.&quot;

According to Lead Editor of [[e-International Relations]], Stephen McGlinchey, &quot;[http://www.e-ir.info/?p=1394 Neo-conservatism] is something of a chimera in modern politics. For its opponents it is a distinct political movement that emphasizes the blending of military power with Wilsonian idealism, yet for its supporters it is more of a ‘persuasion’ that individuals of many types drift into and out of. Regardless of which is more correct, it is now widely accepted that the neo-conservative impulse has been visible in modern American foreign policy and that it has left a distinct impact&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-ir.info/?p=1394&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoconservatives hold the &quot;conviction that communism was a monstrous evil and a potent danger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Can the Neocons Get Their Groove Back? |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2006-11-19 |first=Joshua |last=Muravchik |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111701474_pf.html |accessdate=2006-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They support  [[social welfare]] programs  that were rejected by [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]].

Neoconservatism first emerged in the late 1960s as an effort to combat the radical cultural changes taking place within the United States. Irving Kristol wrote: &quot;If there is any one thing that neoconservatives are unanimous about, it is their dislike of the [[counterculture]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kristol, ''What Is a Neoconservative?'' 87&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Podhoretz agreed: &quot;Revulsion against the counterculture accounted for more converts to neoconservatism than any other single factor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Podhoretz, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement began to focus on such foreign issues in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaisse, ''Neoconservatism'' (2010) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 an early study by liberal [[Peter Steinfels]] concentrated on the ideas of [[Irving Kristol]], [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] and [[Daniel Bell]]. He noted that the stress on foreign affairs &quot;emerged after the New Left and the counterculture had dissolved as convincing foils for neoconservatism .... The essential source of their anxiety is not military or geopolitical or to be found overseas at all; it is domestic and cultural and ideological.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steinfels, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoconservative foreign policy is a descendant of  [[idealism (international relations)|Wilsonian idealism]]. Neoconservatives support [[democracy promotion]] by the U.S. and other democracies, based on the claim that they think that human rights belong to everyone. They criticized the [[United Nations]] and [[detente]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. On [[domestic policy]], they support a welfare state, like European and Canadian conservatives and unlike U.S.  [[social conservatism|social conservatives]]. According to [[Norman Podhoretz]],

{{quote|&quot;the neo-conservatives dissociated themselves from the wholesale opposition to the welfare state which had marked American conservatism since the days of the [[New Deal]]&quot; and . . . while neoconservatives supported &quot;setting certain limits&quot; to the welfare state, those limits did not involve &quot;issues of principle, such as the legitimate size and role of the central government in the American constitutional order&quot; but were to be &quot;determined by practical considerations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel T. Francis|Francis, Samuel]] (2004-06-07) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2004/jun/07/00036/ Idol With Clay Feet], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Democracy promotion]] is supported by a belief that freedom is a universal [[human right]] and by  polls showing majority support for democracy in countries with authoritarian regimes. Democracy promotion is said to have another benefit, in that democracy and responsive government are expected to reduce the appeal of [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamicism]]. Neoconservatives have cited political scientists{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} who have argued that democratic regimes are less likely to start wars. Further, they argue that the lack of freedoms, lack of economic opportunities, and the lack of secular general education in authoritarian regimes promotes radicalism and extremism. Consequently, neoconservatives advocate the democracy promotion to regions of the world where it currently does not prevail, notably the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of the Middle East, communist China and [[North Korea]], and [[Iran]].

In July 2008 [[Joe Klein]] wrote in [[TIME]] magazine that today's neoconservatives are more interested in confronting enemies than in cultivating friends. He questioned the sincerity of neoconservative interest in exporting democracy and freedom, saying, ''&quot;Neoconservatism in foreign policy is best described as unilateral bellicosity cloaked in the utopian rhetoric of freedom and democracy.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Joe [http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1826064,00.html &quot;McCain's Foreign Policy Frustration&quot;] [[TIME]] magazine, July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 [[Andrew Sullivan]] wrote he no longer took neoconservatism seriously because its basic tenet was defense of Israel:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sullivan,[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/02/a-false-premise.html &quot;A [[False premise|False Premise]]&quot;], Sullivan's Daily Dish, February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The closer you examine it, the clearer it is that neoconservatism, in large part, is simply about enabling the most irredentist elements in Israel and sustaining a permanent war against anyone or any country who disagrees with the Israeli right. That's the conclusion I've been forced to these last few years. And to insist that America adopt exactly the same constant-war-as-survival that Israelis have been slowly forced into... But America is not Israel. And once that distinction is made, much of the neoconservative ideology collapses.}}

Neoconservatives respond to charges of merely rationalizing support for Israel by noting that their &quot;position on the Middle East conflict was exactly congruous with the neoconservative position on conflicts everywhere else in the world, including places where neither Jews nor Israeli interests could be found—not to mention the fact that non-Jewish neoconservatives took the same stands on all of the issues as did their Jewish confrères.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Muravchik: [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-past--present--and-future-of-neoconservatism-10935 The Past, Present, and Future of Neoconservatism] ''Commentary'' October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on economics===
While neoconservatism is primarily concerned with foreign policy, there is also some discussion of internal economic policies.  Neoconservatism is generally supportive of free markets and capitalism, favoring [[supply side economics|supply side]] approaches, but it shows several points of disagreement with [[classical liberalism]] and [[fiscal conservatism]]: Irving Kristol states that neocons are more relaxed about budget deficits and tend to reject the [[Friedrich August Hayek|Hayekian]] notion that the growth of government influence on society and public welfare is &quot;the road to serfdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol: The Neoconservative Persuasion. Weekly Standard, August 25th, 2003 http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/000tzmlw.asp?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, to safeguard democracy, government intervention and budget deficits may sometimes be necessary, Kristol argues.

Further, neoconservative ideology stresses that while free markets do provide material goods in an efficient way, they lack the moral guidance human beings  need to fulfill their needs. Morality can be found only in tradition, they say and, contrary to the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view, markets do pose questions that cannot be solved within a purely economic framework. &quot;So as the economy only makes up part of our lives, it must not be allowed to take over and entirely dictate to our society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Stelzer concludes that while neoconservative economic policy helped to lower taxes and generate growth, it also led to a certain disregard of fiscal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Stelzer, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Critics consider neoconservatism a bellicose and &quot;heroic&quot; ideology opposed to &quot;mercantile&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; virtues and therefore &quot;a variant of anti-economic thought&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William Coleman: Heroes or Heroics? Neoconservatism, Capitalism, and Bourgeois Ethics. Social Affairs Unit. http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000553.php&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Zeev Sternhell]] states that &quot;Neoconservatism has succeeded in convincing the great majority of Americans that the main questions that concern a society are not economic, and that social questions are really moral questions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell: ''The Anti-Enlightenment Tradition''. New Haven, Yale University Press, 2010 ISBN 978-0-300-13554-1 p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctions from other conservatives===
Some influential members of the early neoconservative movement, such as [[Elliot Abrams]], were originally members of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], where they advocated for &quot;cold war liberalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=7o5Cpjkk4qsC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=neocon+democrat#v=onepage&amp;q=neocon%20democrat&amp;f=false | title = The prince of darkness: 50 years reporting in Washington | isbn = 978-1-4000-5199-1 | author1 = Novak | first1 = Robert D | year = 2007 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=GqZ_JSy-QOkC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=neocon+democrat#v=onepage&amp;q=neocon%20democrat&amp;f=false | title = They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons | isbn = 978-1-4000-7620-8 | author1 = Heilbrunn | first1 = Jacob | date = 2009-01-06 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; But since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, in some cases, even before that, they have been in electoral alignment with other conservatives in the Republican Party and have served in the same presidential administrations. While they have often ignored ideological differences in alliance against those to their left, neoconservatives differ from ''[[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]]''. In particular, they disagree with [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[protectionism]], and [[non-interventionism]] in foreign policy, ideologies that are rooted in American history, but have fallen out of the mainstream U.S. politics after World War II. Compared with [[traditionalist conservatism]] and [[libertarianism]], which may be non-interventionist, neoconservatism emphasizes defense capability, challenging regimes hostile to the values and interests of the United States{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Neoconservatives also believe in [[democratic peace theory]], the proposition that democracies never or almost never go to war with one another.

===Criticism of terminology===
Some of those identified as ''neoconservative'' reject the term, arguing that it lacks a coherent definition, or that it was coherent only in the context of the Cold War. For example, conservative writer [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]] argues that the increasing use of the term ''neoconservative'' since the 2003 start of the [[Iraq War]] has made it irrelevant:{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} &lt;!-- missing cite to &quot;a recent interview with an Italian newspaper&quot; --&gt;
{{quote|Neo-conservatism is a term almost exclusively used by the enemies of America's liberation of Iraq. There is no 'neo-conservative' movement in the United States. When there was one, it was made up of former Democrats who embraced the welfare state but supported Ronald Reagan's Cold War policies against the Soviet bloc. Today 'neo-conservatism' identifies those who believe in an aggressive policy against radical Islam and the global terrorists.}}

The term may have lost meaning due to excessive and inconsistent use. For example, [[Dick Cheney]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] have been identified{{by whom|date=September 2012}} as leading neoconservatives despite the fact that they have been lifelong conservative Republicans (though Cheney and Rice have supported [[Irving Kristol]]'s ideas) and differ from most neoconservatives on some issues.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Some critics reject the idea that there is a neoconservative movement separate from traditional American conservatism; some traditional conservatives are skeptical of the contemporary usage of the term and dislike being associated with its stereotypes or supposed agendas. For example, columnist [[David Harsanyi]] wrote, &quot;These days, it seems that even temperate support for military action against dictators and terrorists qualifies you a neocon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2332 |title=Beware the Neocons |first=David |last=Harsanyi |authorlink=David Harsanyi |work=[[FrontPage Magazine]] |date=2002-08-13 |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonah Goldberg]] rejected the label as trite and over-used, arguing &quot;There's nothing 'neo' about me: I was never anything other than conservative.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====Antisemitism====
{{Further|New antisemitism}}
Some writers and intellectuals have argued that criticism of neoconservatism is often a euphemism for criticism of Jews, and that the term has been adopted by the political left to stigmatize support for Israel. In ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Robert J. Lieber wrote that writers such as [[Michael Lind]], [[Eric Alterman]] and [[Pat Buchanan]] have identified neoconservative [[Paul Wolfowitz]] as the center of a conspiracy theory involving the manipulation of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush White House]] to gain control of the US military and make war on Iraq in the interest of Israel rather than the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Robert J. |last=Lieber |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=7550 |title=The Left's Neocon Conspiracy Theory |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2003-04-29 |accessdate=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Klein]], in [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]], has suggested it is legitimate to look at the religion of neoconservatives. He does not say there was a conspiracy but says there is a case to be made for disproportionate influence of Jewish neoconservative figures in US foreign policy, and that several of them supported the Iraq war because of Israel's interests, though sometimes in an unconscious contradiction to American interests:

{{quote|&quot;I do believe that there is a group of people who got involved and had a disproportionate influence on U.S. foreign policy. There were people out there in the Jewish community who saw this as a way to create a benign domino theory and eliminate all of Israel's enemies....I think it represents a really dangerous anachronistic neocolonial sensibility. And I think it is a very, very dangerous form of extremism. I think it's bad for Israel and it's bad for America. And these guys have been getting a free ride. And now these people are backing the notion of a war with Iran and not all of them, but some of them, are doing it because they believe that Iran is an existential threat to Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Goldberg]]: [http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/joe_klein_on_neoconservatives.php Joe Klein on Neoconservatives and Iran] The Atlantic blog, July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] derided the &quot;fantasies&quot; of &quot;full-mooners fixated on a... sort of Yiddish [[Trilateral Commission]]&quot;, beliefs which had &quot;hardened into common knowledge... In truth, people labeled neocons (con is short for 'conservative' and neo is short for 'Jewish') travel in widely different circles...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brooks |first=David |editor=Irwin Stelzer, ed. |title=The NeoCon Reader |publisher=Grove |year=2004 |isbn=0-8021-4193-5 |chapter-url=The Neocon Cabal and Other Fantasies }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Rubin]] argued that the neoconservative label is used as an antisemitic pejorative:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-antisemitism&amp;month=0304&amp;week=&amp;msg=4zdiWX1EuCVzeRLDdQySKA&amp;user=&amp;pw= |title=Letter from Washington |last=Rubin |first=Barry |work=h-antisemitism |date=2003-04-06 accessdate=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|First, 'neo-conservative' is a codeword for Jewish. As antisemites did with big business moguls in the nineteenth century and Communist leaders in the twentieth, the trick here is to take all those involved in some aspect of public life and single out those who are Jewish. The implication made is that this is a Jewish-led movement conducted not in the interests of all the, in this case, American people, but to the benefit of Jews, and in this case Israel.}}

====Trotskyism allegation====
[[Trotskyism]] is the current of [[communism]] advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers, emphasizing [[orthodox Marxist]] concepts of [[workers' power]] in opposition to [[state bureaucracy]], and international [[proletarian revolution]], while highly critical of [[Stalinism]] and the Soviet Union. Critics of neo-conservatism have charged that neo-conservatism is descended from Trotskyism, and that Trotskyist traits continue to characterize ideologies and practices of neo-conservatism. During the Reagan Administration, the charge was made that the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy of the Reagan administration]] was being run by Trotskyists.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This claim was called a &quot;myth&quot; by {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lip34&quot;&gt;&quot;A 1987 article in ''The New Republic'' described these developments as a Trotskyist takeover of the Reagan administration&quot;, wrote {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Trotskyist&quot; charge has been repeated and even widened by journalist [[Michael Lind]] in 2003 to assert a takeover of the [[foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration]] by former Trotskyists;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The weird men behind George&amp;nbsp;W. Bush's war|first=Michael|last=Lind|journal=New Statesman|location=London|month=7 April|year=2003

|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind's &quot;amalgamation of the defense intellectuals with the traditions and theories of 'the largely Jewish-American Trotskyist movement' [in Lind's words]&quot; was criticized in 2003 by University&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Michigan professor Alan&amp;nbsp;M. Wald,&lt;ref name=&quot;harv27June2003&quot;/&gt;  who had discussed Trotskyism &lt;!-- and [[neoconservatism]] --&gt; in his history of &quot;[[The New York Intellectuals|the New York intellectuals]]&quot;&lt;!-- annotation by editor of journal, so not OR --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tandfonline&quot; /&gt;

The charge that neoconservativism is related to [[Leninism]] has been raised, also. [[Francis Fukuyama]] identified neoconservatism with Leninism in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fukuyama&quot;/&gt; He wrote that neoconservatives:&lt;blockquote&gt;…believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its [[Bolshevik]] version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fukuyama&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
The term ''neoconservative'' may be used pejoratively by self-described [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], liberals, progressives, or [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].

Critics take issue with neoconservatives' support for aggressive foreign policy. Critics from the [[left-wing politics|left]] take issue with what they characterize as [[unilateralism]] and lack of concern with [[consensus|international consensus]] through organizations such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinsley |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Kinsley |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57779-2005Apr15.html |title=The Neocons' Unabashed Reversal |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2005-04-17 |page=B07 |accessdate=2006-12-25 }} Kinsley quotes [[Rich Lowry]], whom he describes as &quot;a conservative of the non-neo variety&quot;, as criticizing the neoconservatives &quot;messianic vision&quot; and &quot;excessive optimism&quot;; Kinsley contrasts the present-day neoconservative foreign policy to earlier neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick's &quot;tough-minded pragmatism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jacques, &quot;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9115,1448960,00.html The neocon revolution]&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 31, 2005.

Accessed online 25 December 2006 on the site of the Mouvement laïque québécois.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoconservatives respond by describing their shared view as a [[belief]] that national security is best attained by actively promoting freedom and democracy abroad as in the [[democratic peace theory]] through the support of pro-democracy movements, foreign aid and in certain cases [[foreign interventionism|military intervention]]. This is a departure from the traditional conservative tendency to support friendly regimes in matters of trade and anti-communism even at the expense of undermining existing democratic systems and possible destabilization.

Republican Congressman and libertarian leaning 2012 Presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] has been a longtime critic of the neoconservative movement as an attack on freedom and the U.S. Constitution, including an extensive speech on the House floor addressing neoconservative roots and how neoconservatism is neither new nor conservative.  That speech can be seen in a variety of places online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewpvcxAwTk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]] in a column named 'Years Of Shame' commemorating the tenth anniversary of 9/11 attacks, criticized the Neoconservatives for taking America to a war unrelated to 9/11 attacks and fought for wrong reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, [&quot;http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/more-about-the-911-anniversary/ Years Of Shame]&quot;, ''[[NYT]]'', September 11, 2011. Accessed online September 17, 2011. (Cited for &quot;criticism by a significant source&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism and secrecy===
[[John McGowan (professor)|John McGowan]], professor of humanities at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], states, after an extensive review of neoconservative literature and theory, that neoconservatives are attempting to build an [[American imperialism|American Empire]], seen as successor to the [[British Empire]], its aim being to perpetuate a [[Pax Americana]]. As imperialism is largely seen as unacceptable by the American public, neoconservatives do not articulate their ideas and goals in a frank manner in public discourse. McGowan states,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGowan&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=McGowan |first=J. |year=2007 |chapter=Neoconservatism |pages=124–133 |title=American Liberalism: An Interpretation for Our Time |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-3171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
|Frank neoconservatives like Robert Kaplan and Niall Ferguson recognize that they are proposing imperialism as the alternative to liberal internationalism. Yet both Kaplan and Ferguson also understand that imperialism runs so counter to American's liberal tradition that it must... remain a foreign policy that dare not speak its name... While Ferguson, the Brit, laments that Americans cannot just openly shoulder the white man's burden, Kaplan the American, tells us that &quot;only through stealth and anxious foresight&quot; can the United States continue to pursue the &quot;imperial reality [that] already dominates our foreign policy&quot;, but must be disavowed in light of &quot;our anti-imperial traditions, and... the fact that imperialism is delegitimized in public discourse&quot;... The Bush administration, justifying all of its actions by an appeal to &quot;national security&quot;, has kept as many of those actions as it can secret and has scorned all limitations to executive power by other branches of government or international law. }}

===Friction with paleoconservatism===
{{Main|Neoconservatism and paleoconservatism}}

Starting in the 1980s, disputes over Israel and public policy contributed to a sharp conflict with [[paleoconservatives]],
who argue that neoconservatives are an illegitimate addition to the conservative movement.  For example, [[Pat Buchanan]] calls neoconservatism &quot;a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tolson 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The open rift is often traced back to a 1981 dispute over Ronald Reagan's nomination of [[Mel Bradford]], a Southerner, to run the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. Bradford withdrew after neoconservatives complained that he had criticized [[Abraham Lincoln]]; the paleoconservatives supported Bradford.

==Neoconservatism in other countries==
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}

The movement has been influential in other countries. Variants of neoconservatism can be found in the [[Neoconservatism in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], the [[British neoconservatism|United Kingdom]] and [[Neoconservatism in Japan|Japan]].

==Notable figures connected to neoconservatism==
The list includes public figures identified as personally a neoconservative at an important time or a high official with numerous neoconservative advisors, such as George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.  Some are dead, or are ex-neoconservatives.
