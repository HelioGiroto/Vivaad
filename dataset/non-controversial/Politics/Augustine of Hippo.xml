November 13, 354 – August 28, 430), also known as '''St. Augustine''', '''St. Austin''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage College Dictionary |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Company]] |location=Boston, MA |year=1997 |isbn=0-395-66917-0 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''St. Augoustinos''', was [[bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]] (present-day [[Annaba]], Algeria). He was a [[Latin]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] from the [[Africa Province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] and is generally considered as one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all times. His writings were very influential in the development of [[Western Christianity]].

According to his contemporary [[Jerome]], Augustine &quot;established anew the ancient Faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: &quot;You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith&quot; (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei''). Cf.

When the [[Western Roman Empire]] was starting to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the [[Catholic Church]] as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]] (in [[City of God (book)|a book of the same name]]), distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will |title=Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 |publisher=MJF Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=1-56731-014-1 |authorlink=Will Durant}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's ''City of God'' was closely identified with the Church, the community that worshiped the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilken |first=Robert L. |title=The Spirit of Early Christian Thought |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |year=2003 |isbn=0-300-10598-3 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic Church and the [[Anglican Communion]], he is a saint and pre-eminent [[Doctor of the Church]], and the patron of the [[Augustinians]]; his memorial is celebrated 28 August, the day of his death. He is the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnoYrSaint&quot;&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the [[Protestant Reformation]] due to his teaching on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] he is also considered a saint, his feast day being celebrated on 15 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Archimandrite [now Archbishop] Chrysostomos | title =Book Review: ''The Place of Blessed Augustine in the Orthodox Church'' | journal =Orthodox Tradition | volume =II | issue =3&amp;4 | pages =40–43 | url =http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/bless_aug.aspx#rose | accessdate =2007-06-28|authorlink=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070710012506/http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/bless_aug.aspx| archivedate= 10 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carries the additional title of ''Blessed''.

==Life==

===Early childhood===
[[File:Augustine at the school of taghaste.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Augustine at the school of [[Souk Ahras|Taghaste]] by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]]]
Augustine was born in 354 in the [[municipium]] of Thagaste (now [[Souk Ahras]], [[Algeria]]) in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul MacKendrick]], ''The North African Stones Speak'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980; p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', [[Everett Ferguson]], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, p.776&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Patricius, was a pagan, and his mother, [[Saint Monica|Monica]], was Christian.  Scholars believe that Augustine's ancestors included Berbers, Latins and Phoenicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;&gt;Kim Power, &quot;Family, Relatives&quot;, ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia''. Allan D. Fitzgerald (ed.). Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1999, pp. 353 – 354. ISBN 978-0-8028-3843-8&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were [[liberti|freedmen]] of the ''[[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]]'' given full Roman citizenship by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel, ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd, 2002, p5&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin, on the basis of her name,&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brett and Elizabeth Fentress, ''The Berbers'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, p.71, 293&lt;/ref&gt; but as his family were ''honestiores'', Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;/&gt; At the age of 11, he was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about 19 miles south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Knowles and Pachomios Penkett, ''Augustine and his World'' Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While at home in 369 and 370, he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''Hortensius'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression on him and sparking his interest in philosophy.&lt;ref name=EA&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', v.2, p. 685. Danbury, CT: Grolier Incorporated, 1997. ISBN 0-7172-0129-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying at Carthage===
At age 17, through the generosity of fellow citizen Romanianus,&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]]. Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]], much to the despair of his mother, Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pope|first=Hugh|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Saint Monica|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote= At Carthage Augustine had become a Manichean and when on his return home he ventilated certain heretical propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strangevision which she had urged her to recall him. It was at this time that she went to see a certain holy bishop, whose name is not given, but who consoled her with the now famous words, &quot;the child of those tears shall never perish.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a youth Augustine lived a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits with women and urged the inexperienced boys, like Augustine, to seek out experiences or to make up stories about experiences in order to gain acceptance and avoid ridicule.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, &quot;Grant me [[chastity]] and continence, but not yet&quot; ({{lang-la|da mihi castitatem et continentiam, sed noli modo}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Conf.'' 8.7.17&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, he began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. She was his lover for over thirteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 4:2&lt;/ref&gt; who was said to have been extremely intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A'Becket|first=John|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adeodatus|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01141e.htm|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Seeing the wonderful intelligence of his son, Augustine felt a sort of awe. &quot;The grandeur of his mind filled me with a kind of terror&quot;, he says himself (De beata vita, c. vi).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching rhetoric===
During the years 373 and 374, Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric, and would remain there for the next nine years.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Disturbed by the unruly behavior of the students in Carthage, in 383 he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced. However, Augustine was disappointed with the Roman schools, where he was met with apathy. Once the time came for his students to pay their fees they simply fled. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who had been asked to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Sainte Monique.jpg|left|thumb|&quot;St Augustine and [[Monica (Christian saint)|Monica]]&quot; (1846), by [[Ary Scheffer]].]]

Augustine won the job and headed north to take up his position in late 384. At the age of thirty, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world – at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. During this period, although Augustine showed some fervor for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or &quot;elect&quot; but remained an &quot;auditor&quot;, the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;/&gt;

While he was in Milan, Augustine's life changed. While still at Carthage, he had begun to move away from Manichaeism, in part because of a disappointing meeting with the Manichean Bishop, Faustus of Mileve, a key exponent of Manichaean theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;/&gt; In Rome, he is reported to have completely turned away from Manichaeanism, and instead embraced the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the New Academy movement. At Milan, his mother pressured him to become a Christian. Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]] were also leading him in this direction, and his friend Simplicianus urged him that way as well.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; But it was the bishop of Milan, [[Ambrose]], who had most influence over Augustine. Ambrose was a master of rhetoric like Augustine himself, but older and more experienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeDuhn2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason David BeDuhn|title=Augustine's Manichaean dilemma: Conversion and apostasy, 373-388 C.E.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=17 June 2011|date=28 October 2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and he allowed her to arrange a society marriage, for which he abandoned his concubine. It is believed that Augustine truly loved the woman he had lived with for so long. In his &quot;Confessions,&quot; he expressed how deeply he was hurt by ending this relationship, and also admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain over time. However, he had to wait two years until his fiancee came of age, so despite the grief he felt over leaving &quot;The One&quot;, as he called her, he soon took another concubine. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancee, but never renewed his relationship with &quot;The One&quot; and soon left his second concubine.

It was because of ''[[otium]]'' that [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at Cassiciacum, a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vita otium'' - the Christian life of leisure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferguson208&quot;&gt;Ferguson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine had been awarded a job of professor of rhetoric in Milan at the time he was living at Cassiciacum around 383. In 388, he returned to Africa and his home country and pursued a life of aristocratic ''otium'' at his family's property.&lt;ref&gt;Possidius, ''v. Aug.'' 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lepelley, 2:176-77&lt;/ref&gt; In 391 he was ordained bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (hence obtaining the name &quot;Augustine of Hippo&quot;) and gave his property to the church of Thagaste.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''ep.'' 126.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian conversion ===

In the summer of 386, after having heard the story of Placianus about his and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], which greatly inspired him, Augustine underwent a profound personal crisis, leading him to convert to [[Christianity]], abandon his career in rhetoric, quit his teaching position in Milan, give up any ideas of marriage, and devote himself entirely to serving [[God]] and to the practices of [[priesthood]], which included [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]]. According to Augustine his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him in a sing-song voice, &quot;Take up and read&quot; ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}):

{{quotation|I threw myself down somehow under a certain figtree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=152|coauthors=Henry Chadwick|title=Confessions|quote=Footnote 1: Perhaps a symbolic reference to the figtree of Adam ({{bibleref2|Gen|3:7}}; cf. {{bibleref2|John|1:48}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and let my tears flow freely. Rivers streamed from my eyes, a sacrifice acceptable to you {{bibleref2c|Ps|50:19}} and (though not in these words, yet in this sense) I repeatedly said to you: 'How long, O Lord? How long, Lord, will you be angry to the uttermost? Do not be mindful of our old iniquities.'{{bibleref2c|Ps|6:4}}. For I felt my past to have a grip on me. It uttered wretched cries: 'How long, how long is it to be?' 'Tomorrow, tomorrow.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=152|coauthors=Henry Chadwick|title=Confessions|quote=Footnote 2: Persius, ''Satires'' 5.66.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'Why not now? Why not an end to my impure life in this very hour?'
&lt;p&gt;
As I was saying this and weeping in the bitter agony of my heart, suddenly I heard a voice from the nearby house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=152|coauthors=Henry Chadwick|title=Confessions|quote=Footnote 3: The oldest manuscript reads here 'from the house of God'. The child's voice is in any event a divine oracle to Augustine. The variant may echo {{bibleref2|Ps|41:5}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; chanting as if it might be a boy or a girl (I do not know which), saying and repeating over and over again 'Pick up and read, pick up and read.' At once my countenance changed, and I began to think intently whether there might be some sort of children's game in which such a chant is used. But I could not remember having heard of one.  I checked the flood of tears and stood up. I interpreted it solely as a divine command to me to open the book and read the first chapter I might find. For I had heard how [[Anthony the Great|Antony]] happened to be present at the gospel reading, and took it as an admonition addressed to himself when the words were read: 'Go, sell all you have, give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me'{{bibleref2c|Matt|19:21}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=153|coauthors=Henry Chadwick|title=Confessions|quote=Footnote 1: Athanasius, ''Life of Antony'' 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By such an inspired utterance he was immediately 'converted to you' (Ps. 50.15). So I hurried back to the place where Alypius was sitting. There I had put down the book of the apostle when I got up. I seized it, opened it and in silence read the first passage on which my eyes lit: 'Not in riots and drunken parties, not in eroticism and indecencies, not in strife and rivalry, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh in its lusts'{{bibleref2c|Rom|13:13-15}}.
&lt;p&gt;
I neither wished nor needed to read further. At once, with the last words of this sentence, it was as if a light of relief from all anxiety flooded into my heart. All the shadows of doubt were dispelled.|''The Confessions of Saint Augustine'', Book VIII, Paragraphs 28 and 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustine|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=152–153|coauthors=Henry Chadwick}}, Scripture References Present in Chadwick's translation but not in original Latin manuscripts&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The volume Augustine read was Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]]. He wrote an account of his conversion in his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which became a classic of Christian theology. Ambrose baptized Augustine, along with his son, Adeodatus, on [[Easter Vigil]] in 387 in Milan, and a year later they returned to Africa.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Also in 388 he completed his ''[[Christian apologetics|apology]]'' ''On the Holiness of the Catholic Church''.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;/&gt; On the way back to Africa Augustine's mother Monica died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pope|first=Hugh|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Saint Monica|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Here death overtook Monica and the finest pages of his &quot;Confessions&quot; were penned as the result of the emotion Augustine then experienced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Adeodatus soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A'Becket|first=John|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adeodatus|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01141e.htm|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priesthood===
[[File:Jaume Huguet - The Consecration of St Augustine - WGA11794.jpg|thumb|''[[The Consecration of Saint Augustine]]'' by [[Jaume Huguet]]]]Upon his return to north Africa Augustine sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a [[monastic]] foundation for himself and a group of friends.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; In 391 he was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in Hippo Regius (now [[Annaba]], in [[Algeria]]). He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;&gt;Portalié, Eugène.

Retrieved 30 September  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 395 he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. Augustine of Hippo: A Biography. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in this position until his death in 430. Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. He left his monastery, but continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' his monastery that has led him to be designated the &quot;[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-augustine-of-hippo/ Saint Augustine of Hippo] at ''saints.sqpn.com''.  Accessed 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (titular see)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, Herbert T. The Life of Saint Augustine: A Translation of the Sancti Augustini Vita by Possidius, Bishop of Calama. Merchantville, NJ: Evolution Publishing, 2008. ISBN 1-889758-90-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Lombardia Pavia1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Tomb in [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] Basilica, Pavia.]]

Shortly before Augustine's death, Roman Africa was invaded by the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that had converted to [[Arianism]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine took place during the siege. While Augustine was confined to his sick bed, a man petitioned him that he might lay his hands upon a relative who was ill. Augustine replied that if he had any power to cure the sick, he would surely have applied it on himself first. The visitor declared that he was told in a dream to go to Augustine so that his relative would be made whole. When Augustine heard this, he no longer hesitated, but laid his hands upon the sick man, who departed from Augustine's presence healed.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Possidius also gives a first-hand account of Augustine's death, which occurred on August 28, 430, while Hippo was still besieged. Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his death the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_augustine.html &quot;St Augustine of Hippo&quot;] at ''PhilosophyBasics.com''. Accessed 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bede|Bede's]] ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later removed to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]] by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720 his remains were moved again by Peter, bishop of [[Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]], in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327 Pope John XXII issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine, which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life. By that time, however, the actual remains of Augustine could not be authenticated. Stonemasons working in the crypt altar removed paving blocks and discovered a marble box. Within it were other boxes; in the third box were fragments of wood, numerous bones and bone fragments, and glass vials. Some of the workers later claimed to have seen the name &quot;Augustine&quot; written in charcoal on the top of the box. A factor complicating the authentication of the remains was that San Pietro was shared by two Augustinian religious orders in bitter rivalry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled Arca, which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair and was a military magazine during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] occupation of the city. It was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;Shanon Dale, 2001. &quot;A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII&quot;, in JMH 27, p. 55ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Samuel Stone, ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]]) 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;Passage based on F.A. Wright and T.A. Sinclair, ''A History of Later Latin Literature'' (London 1931), pp. 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]], texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''), [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]], many [[sermons]] and [[Letter (message)|letters]], and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessiones]]'' (''Confessions''), which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate dei'' (''[[The City of God (book)|Of the City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of [[Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote ''On Free Choice Of The Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.
In his work, De Ordine (&quot;On Order&quot;), &quot;Augustine, stumbling upon a [[sacred cockfight|cockfight]], had a revelation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1088916?uid=3739688&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21100898042461] Deep Ambivalence: Notes on a Greek Cockfight (Part 1) - Eric Esapo - 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and writes ''in every motion of these animals unendowed with reason there was nothing ungraceful since, of course, another higher reason was guiding everything they did''.&lt;ref&gt;Cockfight - A Case Book - Allen Dundes&lt;/ref&gt; Again in understanding God's creation and His order, Augustine further writes, ''Order is that which will lead us to God, if we hold to it during life; and unless we do hold to it during life, we shall not come to God.''

==Influence as a theologian and thinker==
Augustine was a bishop, priest, and father who remains a central figure, both within Christianity and in the history of Western thought, and is considered by modern historian [[Thomas Cahill]] to be the first medieval man and the last classical man.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Cahill, ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'' Ch.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, he was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neo-platonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the [[Enneads]], probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism some ideas are still visible in his early writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] ''History of western Philosophy'' Book II Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; His generally favourable view of Neoplatonic thought contributed to the &quot;baptism&quot; of Greek thought and its entrance into the Christian and subsequently the [[Europe]]an intellectual tradition. His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In addition, Augustine was influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), Cicero (known for his teaching on argument), and [[Aristotle]] (particularly his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] and [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]).

Augustine's concept of original sin was expounded in his works against the [[Pelagians]]. However, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] took much of Augustine's theology while creating his own unique synthesis of Greek and Christian thought after the widespread rediscovery of the work of Aristotle. Augustine's doctrine of [[efficacious grace]] found eloquent expression in the works of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]; also [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] would look back to him as their inspiration.

Augustine was [[canonization|canonized]] by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02662a.htm|title=New Advent - Pope Boniface VIII|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[feast day]] is August 28, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnoYrSaint&quot;/&gt;

The latter part of Augustine's ''Confessions'' consists of an extended meditation on the nature of time. Even the [[agnostic]] [[philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by this. He wrote, &quot;a very admirable relativistic theory of time. ... It contains a better and clearer statement than [[Kant]]'s of the subjective theory of time - a theory which, since Kant, has been widely accepted among philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]], 1946, reprinted Unwin Paperbacks 1979, pp 352-3&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the &quot;eternal present&quot;; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt; clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', has had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Paulo|first=Craig J. N.|title=The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology|year=2006|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=978-0-7734-5689}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: &quot;The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1964, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work, ''Being and Time''.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Heidegger's articulations of how &quot;Being-in-the-world&quot; is described through thinking about ''seeing'': &quot;The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.&quot; Heidegger then quotes the ''Confessions'': &quot;Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'&quot;. ''Being and Time'' Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964. 171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): &quot;The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chiba, Shin. Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship.''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 57, No. 3 (Summer, 1995), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' finds likeness between Augustine and Arendt in their concepts of evil: &quot;Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced the Holocaust as merely banal [in ''Eichmann in Jerusalem''].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinder, Glenn. ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 91, No. 2 (June , 1997), pp. 432-433&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures.

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against paganism and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and witchcraft. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Marxism, Freudianism and Eco-fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deepak Lal&quot;&gt;Lal, D. Morality and Capitalism: Learning from the Past. Working Paper Number 812, Department of Economics, University of California, Los Angeles. March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on St. Thomas Aquinas===
For quotations of St. Augustine by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] see [[Aquinas and the Sacraments]] and [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]].

On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Original Sin''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Protestant reformers===
While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and [[John Calvin]] affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article: ''Original Sin''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Modern-Day Ministers and Authors===
Augustine's influence has impacted many modern day theologians and authors. One known theologian and author is [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], whose series of books are called, ''The Swans Are Not Silent'' in which the first book is titled ''The Legacy of Sovereign Joy'', referring to a quote taken from (''Confessions, IX,1'').

&quot;How sweet it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys which I had once feared to lose.... You drove them from me, you who are the true, the sovereign joy. You drove them from me and took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure, though not of flesh and blood, you who outshine all light, yet are hidden deeper than any secret in our hearts, you who surpass all honor, though not in the eyes of men who see all honor in themselves.... O Lord my God, my Light, my Wealth, and My Salvation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Confessions, ISBN 978-0-8024-5651-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on St. Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career.

In his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', Pope [[Benedict XVI]], a prolific and influential Catholic theologian in his own right before ascending to the papacy, claims St. Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.

===Anthropology===
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with very clear [[theological anthropology|anthropological]] vision.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt]&quot;Augustine&quot; accessed March 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]]:
{{quotation|In no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned. (...) For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature of man.&lt;ref&gt;''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627[13–22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is [[marriage]]: ''caro tua, coniunx tua - your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4,4-5; CCL 46, 234-235.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another.

They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It suffices for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct; to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and that the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7-6.13; cf. W.E. Mann, ''Inner-Life Ethics'', in: {{cite book

===Astrology===
Augustine's contemporaries often believed astrology to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later as a bishop he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and horoscopes. (Augustine's term &quot;mathematici&quot;. meaning &quot;astrologers&quot;,  is sometimes mistranslated as &quot;mathematicians&quot;.) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but &quot;common swindlers&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |title= Augustine the Bishop.

===Baptism===
Against the [[Pelagians]] Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question if baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons:

{{quotation|&quot;God does not remit sins but to the baptized&quot;.|A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed, Paragraph 16}}

This belief was shared by many early Christians.

However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the Apocalypse, may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents:

{{quotation|&quot;But what shall become of the little ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days [the Apocalypse] there shall not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver of regeneration.&quot;|City of God, Book 20, Chapter 8}}

===Creation===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}

In &quot;''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis''&quot; Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a plain account of Genesis would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way - it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omni simul'' (&quot;he created all things at once&quot;), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm.

Retrieved 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;''City of God''&quot;, Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings:

{{quotation|Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say, when they speak of the nature and origin of the human race. For some hold the same opinion regarding men that they hold regarding the world itself, that they have always been... They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the history of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that not 6000 years have yet passed.|Augustine, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [419].}}

===Ecclesiology===
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[Catholic hierarchy|hierarchy]], the [[Catholic sacraments|sacraments]], and the laity) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacraments]] while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of &quot;wheat&quot; and &quot;tares&quot;, that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''City of God''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

===Eschatology===
Augustine originally believed that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]] ([[premillennialism]] or chiliasm) but rejected the system as carnal. He was the first theologian to systematically expound a doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where the Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig L. Blomberg|title=From Pentecost to Patmos|publisher=Apollos|year=2006|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Reformation, theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism while rejecting aspects of mediaeval ecclesiology which had been built on Augustine's teaching.

Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:unspecified&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, unspecified article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enchiridion 110&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:unspecified&quot;/&gt;

===Epistemological views===

Augustine's intellectual development was shaped by epistemological concerns. His early dialogues ([[Contra academicos]] (386) and [[De Magistro]] (389)), both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with skeptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[Illuminationist philosophy|inner illumination]]. Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in [[On the Trinity]] (VIII.6.9), and develops what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gareth B. Matthews|title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognizes the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argues that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Peter|coauthors=Nathan Ballantyne|title=Augustine on gTestimony|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045|url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercession of the Saints===
In his book ''Confessions'', Augustine wrote of a peculiar practice of his Christian mother, Monica, in which she &quot;brought to certain oratories, erected in the memory of the saints, offerings of porridge, bread, and wine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Confessions 6.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; When she moved to Milan, the bishop Ambrose forbade her to use the offering of wine, since &quot;it might be an occasion of gluttony for those who were already given to drink&quot;. So, Augustine wrote of her: {{quotation|In place of a basket filled with fruits of the earth, she had learned to bring to the oratories of the martyrs a heart full of purer petitions, and to give all that she could to the poor - so that the communion of the Lord's body might be rightly celebrated in those places where, after the example of his passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed and crowned.|Confessions 6.2.2}}

===Just war===
{{See also|Just War}}
Augustine was one of the first major theologians to assert that Christians should not be pacifists, despite the famous passage, [[turning the other cheek|Matthew 5:39]], which says &quot;But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also&quot;.

Augustine asserted that this was a personal, philosophical stance:

:&quot;What is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html ''A Time For War?'' Christianity Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority:

:&quot;The commandment forbidding killing was not broken by those who have waged wars on the authority of God, or those who have imposed the death-penalty on criminals when representing the authority of the state, the justest and most reasonable source of power&quot;

While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work The City of God:

:But, say they, the wise man will wage just wars. As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war could not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* First, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than for self-gain or as an exercise of power.
* Second, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mariology===
Although Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers.&lt;ref&gt;O Stegmüller, in Marienkunde, 455&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], he defended the ever Virgin Mary as the Mother of God, who, because of her virginity, is full of grace.&lt;ref&gt;De Sacra Virginitate, 6,6, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary ''“conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever”''.&lt;ref&gt;De Saca virginitate 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation===
Augustine took the view that the Biblical text should not be interpreted as properly literal, but rather as metaphorical, if it contradicts what we know from science and our God-given reason. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this &quot;literal sense&quot; does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended metaphor. In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'', St. Augustine wrote:

{{quotation|It not infrequently happens that something about the earth, about the sky, about other elements of this world, about the motion and rotation or even the magnitude and distances of the stars, about definite eclipses of the sun and moon, about the passage of years and seasons, about the nature of animals, of fruits, of stones, and of other such things, may be known with the greatest certainty by reasoning or by experience, even by one who is not a Christian. It is too disgraceful and ruinous, though, and greatly to be avoided, that he [the non-Christian] should hear a Christian speaking so idiotically on these matters, and as if in accord with Christian writings, that he might say that he could scarcely keep from laughing when he saw how totally in error they are. In view of this and in keeping it in mind constantly while dealing with the book of Genesis, I have, insofar as I was able, explained in detail and set forth for consideration the meanings of obscure passages, taking care not to affirm rashly some one meaning to the prejudice of another and perhaps better explanation.|''De Genesi ad literam 1:19–20'', Chapt. 19 [408]}}

{{quotation|With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures. In short, it must be said that our authors knew the truth about the nature of the skies, but it was not the intention of the Spirit of God, who spoke through them, to teach men anything that would not be of use to them for their salvation.|''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9}}

A more clear distinction between &quot;metaphorical&quot; and &quot;literal&quot; in literary texts arose with the rise of the [[Scientific Revolution]], although its source could be found in earlier writings, such as those of [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC). It was even considered heretical to interpret the Bible literally at times.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, St. Jerome: &quot;On First Principles&quot;, Book III, Chapter III, Verse 1. Translated by K. Froehlich.

===Original sin===
{{Main|Original sin}}
Augustine taught that Original sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of ''foolishness'' (''insipientia'') followed by ''pride'' and ''disobedience'' to God or the opposite: pride came first.&lt;ref&gt;He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795)&lt;/ref&gt; The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, p. 192-3 and 12:28, vol. 2, p. 219-20, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ;[[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49,28 and 50-52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371-372 [v. 26-31;1-36];  ''De natura boni'' 34-35; CSEL 25, 872; PL 42, 551-572&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was a symbol of the order of creation.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Augustine, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine explained it in this way: ''Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more. (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]&quot; (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1-12])&lt;/ref&gt; They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if Satan hadn't sown into their senses ''&quot;the root of evil&quot;'' (''radix Mali'').&lt;ref&gt;''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  (&quot;Contra Julianum&quot;, I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; Their nature was wounded by ''concupiscence'' or ''libido'', which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;In one of Augustine's late works, ''Retractationes'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: &quot;Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido&quot; (&quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: «Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest». Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam &quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;. Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi''. Cf. ''De bono coniugali'', 16.18; PL 40, 385; ''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', II, 21.36; PL 44, 443; ''Contra Iulianum'', III, 7.16; PL 44, 710; ibid., V, 16.60; PL 44, 817. See also {{cite book |title= Le mariage chrétien dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin. Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale |author= Idem |year= 1983 |publisher= Études Augustiniennes |location=Paris |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Metaphysics]], ''concupiscence'' is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; PL 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; PL 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; PL 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; PL 44, 697; ''Contra Secundinum Manichaeum'', 15; PL 42, 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of the original sin and of necessity of the redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb. Iul. Praef.'', 2,3; PL 48,111 /v.5-13/; {{cite book |last= Bonner |first= Gerald |title= Rufinus of Syria and African Pelagianism |pages= 35(X) }} in: {{cite book |author= Idem |title= God's Decree and Man's Destiny |location= London |year= 1987 |pages= 31–47 (X) |isbn= 0-86078-203-4 |publisher=  Variorum Reprints}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refused to agree that ''libido'' wounded human will and mind, insisting that the human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v.24-29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15-23].

Life and Controversies |last=Bonner |first=G. |publisher=The Canterbury Press |location=Norwich |year=1986 |pages=355–356 |isbn=0-86078-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Jovinian]], pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, ''e.g.'' fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, ''i.e.'' a person does not use natural desires in a proper way.
In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out to the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God:
{{quotation|For it was not fit that His creature should blush at the work of his Creator; but by a just punishment the disobedience of the members was the retribution to the disobedience of the first man, for which disobedience they blushed when they covered with fig-leaves those shameful parts which previously were not shameful.&lt;br /&gt;
 (...) As, therefore, they were so suddenly ashamed of their nakedness, which they were daily in the habit of looking upon and were not confused, that they could now no longer bear those members naked, but immediately took care to cover them; did not they—he in the open, she in the hidden impulse—perceive those members to be disobedient to the choice of their will, which certainly they ought to have ruled like the rest by their voluntary command? And this they deservedly suffered, because they themselves also were not obedient to their Lord. Therefore they blushed that they in such wise had not manifested service to their Creator, that they should deserve to lose dominion over those members by which children were to be procreated.|''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31-32}}

Augustine had served as a &quot;Hearer&quot; for the Manicheans for about nine years,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. Augustine of Hippo. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1967. ISBN 0-520-00186-9, 35&lt;/ref&gt; who taught that the original sin was carnal knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The Manichaean Version of Genesis 2-4. Translated from the Arabic text of Ibn al-Nadīm, Fihrist, as reproduced by G. Flügel in ''Mani: Seine Lehre und seine Schriften''  (Leipzig, 1862; reprinted, Osnabrück: Biblio Verlag, 1969) 58.11-61.13.[http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm ]. {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But his struggle to understand the cause of evil in the world started before that, at the age of nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;''De libero arbitrio'' 1,9,1.&lt;/ref&gt; By ''malum'' (''evil'') he understood most of all ''concupiscence'', which he interpreted as a vice dominating person and causing in men and women moral disorder. A. Trapè insists that Augustine's personal experience cannot be credited for his doctrine about concupiscence. His marriage experience, though Christian marriage celebration was missing, was exemplary, very normal and by no means specifically sad.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.{{cite book |title= S. Agostino: Introduzione alla Dottrina della Grazia |last= Trapè |first= A. | volume = I - Natura e Grazia | pages = 113–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As J.

Clarke SJ writes: ''Towards Neoplatonism there was throughout his life a decidedly ambivalent attitude; one must expect both agreement and sharp dissent, derivation but also repudiation. In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul. The disagreement chiefly concerned, as we have said, two related and central Christian dogmas: the Incarnation of the Son of God and the resurrection of the flesh''. {{cite journal |last= Clarke, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] |first= T.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against human [[sex]]uality and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the Confessions. But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Bonner's comment explains a little bit why there are so many authors who write false things about Augustine's views: ''It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand''.

Life and Controversies |last=Bonner |first=G. |publisher=The Canterbury Press |location=Norwich |year=1986 |page=312 |isbn=0-86078-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine teaches that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' - remedy of concupiscence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''De continentia'', 12.27; PL 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; PL 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, PL 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, PL 44, 724.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''A Postscript to the Remedium Concupiscentiae'' ’The Thomist 70 (2006): 481-536 [http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/932]&lt;/ref&gt; The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.&lt;ref&gt;See. ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; PL 44,112-113; cf. &quot;On the Litteral meaning of the Genesis'' (De Genesi ad litteram'') 9:6:11, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ, vol. 2, p. 76-77; PL 34, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin was transmitted by [[concupiscence]],&lt;ref&gt;''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218&lt;/ref&gt; which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,&lt;ref&gt;In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and idolatry unbelief, and covetousness idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal'' (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]&quot;, ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)&lt;/ref&gt; making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.

Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, ''i.e.'' [[Councils of Carthage|Carthage]] (418), [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431),
[[Councils of Orange|Orange]] (529), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, ''i.e.'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (401–417) and [[Pope Zosimus]] (417–418). [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''Cur Deus Homo'' the definition that was followed by the great Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the &quot;privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess&quot;, thus interpreting ''concupiscence'' as something more than mere sexual lust, with which some Augustine's disciples had defined it&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=234–7}}; {{cite book |title=St. Augustine of Hippo. Life and Controversies |last=Bonner |first=G. |publisher=The Canterbury Press |location=Norwich |year=1986 |page=371 |isbn=0-86078-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as later did Luther and Calvin, a doctrine condemned in 1567 by [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;/&gt;

[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] suggest that, according to Augustine, human beings are utterly depraved in nature. That humans are spoiled by the original sin to the extent that the very presence of concupiscence, ''fomes peccati'' (''incendiary of sin''), is already a personal sin.&lt;ref&gt;Statement condemned by [[Council of Trent]], ''Decree on Justification'', XI and can. 25 (January 13, 1547)&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's doctrine about the  ''liberum arbitrium'' or free will and its inability to respond to the will of God without divine grace is interpreted in terms of [[Predestination]]: grace is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], results in conversion, and leads to [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]]. The [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] view of Augustine's teachings rests on the assertion that God has foreordained, from eternity, those who will be saved. The number of the elect is fixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; God has chosen the elect certainly and gratuitously, without any previous merit (''ante merita'') on their part.

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;/&gt; He often said that any can be saved if they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;/&gt; While God knows who will be saved and who will not, with no possibility that one destined to be lost will be saved, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;&gt;Portalié, Eugène. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02091a.htm &quot;Teaching of St. Augustine of Hippo&quot;] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company (1907). Retrieved 30 September  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacramental theology===
Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the &quot;regularity&quot; and &quot;validity&quot; of the [[sacraments]]. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of Cyprian, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.

====Eucharist====
Upholding the early Christian understanding of the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, Augustine made the following logical observation regarding this sacrament: &quot;Christ was carried in his own hands when, referring to his own body, he said, ‘This is my body’ [Matt. 26:26]. For he carried that body in his hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Explanations of the Psalms 33:1:10 [405]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sermon addressed to new Christians, Augustine explicitly described the bread and wine as the body and blood of Christ.
:I promised you [new Christians], who have now been baptized, a sermon in which I would explain the sacrament of the Lord’s Table. . . . That bread which you see on the altar, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the body of Christ. That chalice, or rather, what is in that chalice, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the blood of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Sermons 227 [411]&lt;/ref&gt;

:What you see is the bread and the chalice; that is what your own eyes report to you. But what your faith obliges you to accept is that the bread is the body of Christ and the chalice is the blood of Christ. This has been said very briefly, which may perhaps be sufficient for faith; yet faith does desire instruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sermons 272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriology===
Augustine made several statements concerning his views on the limitations of the atonement, such as:
{{quotation|The garden of the Lord's brothers and sisters, includes, yes it includes, it certainly includes not only the roses of martyrs but also the lilies of virgins, and the ivy of married people and the violets of widows. There is absolutely no kind of human beings, dearly beloved, who need to despair of their vocation; '''Christ suffered for all.''' It was truly written, it is he &quot;who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the acknowledgment of the truth.&quot;|Sermon 304.2}}

===Statements on Jews===
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jews by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also quotes part of the same prophecy that says &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot; (Psalm 59:11). Augustine argued that God had allowed the Jews to survive this dispersion as a warning to Christians, thus they were to be permitted to dwell in Christian lands. Augustine further argued that the Jews would be converted at the end of time.&lt;ref&gt;J. Edwards, ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (Stroud, 1999), pp33-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on lust===
Augustine struggled with lust throughout his life. He had a mistress before he converted, but once he became a Christian, he condemned all forms of extra-marital sex (including his previous relationship with his mistress), considering them unlawful and unbiblical. In the ''Confessions'', Augustine describes his personal struggle in vivid terms: &quot;But I, wretched, most wretched, in the very commencement of my early youth, had begged chastity of Thee, and said, 'Grant me chastity and continence, only not yet.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/augustine/Pusey/book08 ''Conf.'' 8.7.17]&lt;/ref&gt; At sixteen Augustine moved to Carthage where again he was plagued by this &quot;wretched sin&quot;:

{{quotation|There seethed all around me a cauldron of lawless loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to love, and out of a deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I sought what I might love, in love with loving, and I hated safety... To love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to me; but more, when I obtained to enjoy the person I loved. I defiled, therefore, the spring of friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and I beclouded its brightness with the hell of lustfulness.|''Confessions'' 3.1.1}}

For Augustine, the evil was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love and lust:

{{quotation| By love I mean the impulse of one's mind to enjoy God on his own account and to enjoy oneself and one's neighbour on account of God, and by lust I mean the impulse of one's mind to enjoy oneself and one's neighbour and any corporeal thing not on account of God.| ''3.37''}}

Here we can see the theoretical resolution of the struggle documented in ''Confessions'': that proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God.

To the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome, he writes, &quot;Truth, another's lust cannot pollute thee.&quot; Chastity is &quot;a virtue of the mind, and is not lost by rape, but is lost by the intention of sin, even if unperformed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. (1945) ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster. p.356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine viewed [[erection]]s themselves as involuntary: ''at times, without intention, the body stirs on its own, insistent; at other times, it leaves a straining lover in the lurch.''&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.17&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Augustine's life experience led him to consider lust to be one of the most grievous sins, and a serious obstacle to the virtuous life.

===Views on Women===

Augustine's view of sexual feelings as sinful impacted his view of women.  His beliefs on this issue were so extreme that he considered a man’s erection to be sinful because it did not take place under his conscious control.  His solution was to place controls on women to limit their ability to influence men: “Thus the woman, but not the man, should veil herself to prevent her from causing this sinful response in the male.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuther, R.R. 2007 pp. 47-68&quot;&gt;Reuther, R.R. (2007). Augustine: sexuality gender and women. In J.C. Stark (Ed.), Feminist interpretations of Augustine. (pp. 47-68).  University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine viewed women not only as threatening to men, but also as intellectually and morally inferior: 

“It is the natural order among people that women serve their husbands and children their parents, because the justice of this lies in (the principle that) the lesser serves the greater . . . This is the natural justice that the weaker brain serve the stronger. This therefore is the evident justice in the relationships between slaves and their masters, that they who excel in reason, excel in power.”&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Questions on the Heptateuch, Book I, § 153, as cited at http://www.womenpriests.org/traditio/inferior.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

“Flesh stands for the woman,” he said, “and the spirit for the husband…”&lt;ref&gt;(Augustine, as cited in Trombley, 2003, p. 239). Trombley, C. (2003). Who said women can’t teach? God’s vision for women in ministry. Gainesville, FL: Bridge-Logos.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;He concluded that 'the serpent, which represents the enticement to disobedience to God and the preference for selfish desires, first approached Eve, because as a woman she had less rationality and self-control and was closer to the ‘lower’ or female part of the soul…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Augustine, as cited in Reuther, 2007, pp. 53-54). Reuther, R.R. (2007). Augustine: sexuality gender and women. In J.C. Stark (Ed.), Feminist interpretations of Augustine. (pp. 47-68).  University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Adam, on the other hand, was equated with the higher, superior part of the human soul.  In fact, his choice to eat the forbidden fruit along with his wife was viewed by Augustine as “an act of kindly companionship, lest she be left alone outside paradise”&lt;ref&gt;(as cited in Reuther, 2007, p. 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In other words, Augustine believed that sin entered the world because man—the spirit—did not exercise proper authority over the woman—the flesh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. (2011). &quot;Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church.&quot; Charleston, SC: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the Role of Women in the Church===

The idea that women cannot lead, teach or be a witness can be found in a document called, in Latin, the [[Decretum Gratiani]].&lt;ref&gt;Raming, I. (2004). A history of women and ordination volume two: The priestly office of women - God’s gift to a renewed church. (B. Cooke &amp; G. Macy, Trans.). Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Raming, the authority of this document rests largely on two sources, Roman law, and the views of the early church fathers—one of the most influential being St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo.&lt;ref&gt;Raming, 2004, pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The legal situation of women under the Corpus Iuris Canonici (1234 - 1916 AD) has been summed up as follows:

“By a principle of civil law, no woman can exercise a public office. By Church Law women are equally barred from all spiritual functions and offices.” 
“A woman can, therefore, not receive any ecclesiastical ordination. If she receives one, the ordination will not imprint a sacramental character . . . .” 
“No woman, however saintly she may be, may either preach or teach . . . .” 
“A wife is under the power of her husband, the husband not under the power of the wife. The husband may punish her. A wife is obliged to follow her husband to wherever he decides to fix his residence.” 
“A woman is bound to greater modesty than a man.” 
“A woman is sooner excused on account of fear than a man. She is dispensed from going to Rome to obtain absolution from an excommunication.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenpriests.org/traditio/inferior.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws and traditions founded upon St. Augustine's views of sexuality and women continue to exercise considerable influence over church doctrinal positions regarding the role of women in the church:&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. (2011). &quot;Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church.&quot; Charleston, SC: Createspace&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Augustine remains the classical theologian for the Western Christian tradition.  His was a brilliant mind, and his voluminous writings grew from a lifetime of grappling with the relation of the Christian tradition to his own spiritual journey.

==Teaching philosophy==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. He introduced the theory of three different categories of students, and instructed teachers to adapt their teaching styles to each student's individual learning style. The three different kinds of students are: the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers; the student who has had no education; and the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated. If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between &quot;having words and having understanding,&quot; and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Augustine introduced the idea of teachers responding positively to the questions they may receive from their students, no matter if the student interrupted his teacher. Augustine also founded the ''restrained'' style of teaching. This teaching style ensures the students' full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material; focuses on one topic at a time; helps them discover what they don't understand, rather than moving on too quickly; anticipates questions; and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Education&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=September 2011}}

Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline. For example, he agreed with using punishment as an incentive for children to learn. He believed all people tend toward evil, and students must therefore be physically punished when they allow their evil desires to direct their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/augustine.html North Carolina State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
English translations of Augustine's work abound. One of the best translations of Augustine into English currently available is the one offered by [[New City Press]] in the series ''The Works of St. Augustine: A translation for the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Boulding's translations of the ''Confessions'' and the ''Expositions of the Psalms'', in particular, have garnered great praise. See for instance ''Catholic Library World'' in reference to the ''Confessions'': &quot;A whole new generation should fall in love with one of Christendoms greatest works thanks to Maria Boulding.&quot; See also the acknowledgment expressed in her [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maria-boulding-nun-and-theologian-who-translated-works-by-st-augustine-1837159.html obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this is also the most complete translation of Augustine's works in English.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of available works here [http://www.newcitypress.com/the-works-of-saint-augustine-1.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  The second most complete translation of Augustine's works in English is by the [[Catholic University of America Press]].&lt;ref&gt;See a list of available works here [http://cuapress.cua.edu/BOOKS/catalog/author/index.cfm?letter=A].&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers a [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#Enga list of selected translations], which however does not claim to be exhaustive.

==In popular culture==
Augustine was played by [[Dary Berkani]] in the 1972 television movie ''[[Augustine of Hippo (film)|Augustine of Hippo]]''.  He was also played by [[Franco Nero]] in the 2010 mini-series ''[[Augustine: The Decline of the Roman Empire]]''. The modern day name links to the Agostinelli Family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4crests.com/agostinelli-coat-of-arms.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jostein Gaarder]]'s book ''[[Vita Brevis]]'' is a translation of a letter Gaarder found in a bookshop in Buenos Aires which is assumed to be a letter from Augustine's concubine to him after he became the Bishop of Hippo.  St. Augustine appears in the novel ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'' by Flann O'Brian (the pen name of Irish Author [[Brian O'Nolan]]). He is summoned to an underwater cavern by an absurd scientist called De Selby; together they discuss life in Heaven and the characters of other Saints. [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.]]'s novel [[A Canticle for Leibowitz]] cites St. Augustine as possibly positing the first version of a theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Walter M. Miller, Jr. A Canticle for Leibowitz,1959, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Dylan]] recorded a song entitled &quot;[[I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine]]&quot; on his album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''.  Pop artist [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] pays an homage of sorts to Augustine's struggles with lust with the song &quot;Saint Augustine in Hell&quot; which appears on the singer's 1993 album ''[[Ten Summoner's Tales]]''.  Christian Rock artist [[Disciple (musician)|Disciple]] named their fourth track on their 2010 release ''Horseshoes and Handgrenades'' after Augustine, called: &quot;The Ballad of St. Augustine&quot;.  The song &quot;St. Augustine&quot; appears on [[Girlyman]]'s album, ''Supernova''.  American rock band Moe named and referenced Augustine of Hippo in their song entitled, &quot;St. Augustine.&quot;
