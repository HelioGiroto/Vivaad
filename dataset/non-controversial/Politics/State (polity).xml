[[File:Leviathan gr.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The frontispiece of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'']]
A '''state''' is an organized community living under a unified [[political system]], the [[government]]&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-state&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=state |work=Concise Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=9th |year=1995 |quote='''3''' (also '''State''') '''a''' an organized political community under one government; a commonwealth; a nation. '''b''' such a community forming part of a federal republic, esp the United States of America |author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[American English]], a [[government]]). States may be [[sovereign]]. The denomination state is also employed to [[federated state]]s that are members of a [[federal union]], which is the [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-state&quot;/&gt; Some states are subject to external [[sovereignty]] or [[hegemony]] where ultimate sovereignty lies in another state.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[Vichy France]] (1940-1944) officially referred to itself as ''l'État français''.&lt;/ref&gt; The state can also be used to refer to the secular branches of government within a state, often as a manner of contrasting them with churches and civilian institutions ([[civil society]]).

==Definitional issues==
There is no academic [[consensus]] on the most appropriate definition of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth et al, 2007: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;state&quot; refers to a set of different, but interrelated and often overlapping, theories about a certain range of political [[phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, 1993: pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; The act of defining the term can be seen as part of an ideological conflict, because different definitions lead to different theories of state function, and as a result validate different political strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, 1993: pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used definition is [[Max Weber]]'s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dubreuil, Benoít|title=Human Evolution and the Origins of Hierarchies: The State of Nature|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-76948-8|page=189|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qBXvK0EkTcwC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon, Scott|title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-674-00977-6|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5OTyH71czwsC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPE&gt;{{cite book|last=Hay|first=Colin|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-14532-5|pages=1469–1474|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donovan, John C.|title=People, power, and politics: an introduction to political science|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8226-3025-8|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6YxnWSrZJWsC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaw, Martin|title=War and genocide: organized killing in modern society|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7456-1907-1|page=59|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nwcSTPnTbOYC&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the state as a compulsory political organization with a [[centralized]] government that maintains a [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] within a certain territory.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth et al, 2007: p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=ayz0kWKhKacC&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;  General categories of state institutions include administrative [[bureaucracies]], [[legal systems]], and [[military]] or [[religious]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Earle, Timothy|chapter=state, state systems|editor=Barfield, Thomas|title=The dictionary of anthropology|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57718-057-9|page=445|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA445}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a state is &quot;'''a''' an organized political community under one [[government]]; a [[commonwealth]]; a [[nation]]. '''b''' such a community forming part of a [[federal republic]], esp the [[United States of America]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-state&quot; /&gt;

===Types of states===
States may be classified as ''[[sovereign state|sovereign]]'' if they are not dependent on, or subject to any other power or state. Other states are subject to external [[sovereignty]] or [[hegemony]] where ultimate sovereignty lies in another state.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-state&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF3&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=sovereign |work=The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] |edition=2nd |yeat=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=Oxford |isbn=0-19-517077-6 |quote=adjective ... [ attrib. ] (of a nation or state) fully independent and determining its own affairs: a sovereign, democratic republic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states are [[federated state]]s which participate in a [[federal union]]. A federated state is a territorial and [[constitution]]al community forming part of a [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF4&quot; /&gt; Such states differ from sovereign states, in that they have transferred a portion of their sovereign powers to a [[federal government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-state&quot; /&gt;

===The state and government===
{{see also|Government|Form of government}}

The concept of the state can be distinguished from the concept of [[government]]. The government is the particular group of people, the administrative [[bureaucracy]], that controls the state apparatus at a given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bealey, Frank|chapter=government|title=The Blackwell dictionary of political science: a user's guide to its terms|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1999|isbn=978-0-631-20695-8|page=147|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6EuKLlzYoTMC&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=bk-aaMVGKO0C&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flint-taylor-137&quot;&gt;Flint &amp; Taylor, 2007: p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; That is, governments are the means through which state power is employed. States are served by a continuous succession of different governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;flint-taylor-137&quot;/&gt;

Each successive government is composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who monopolize political decision-making, and are separated by status and organization from the population as a whole. Their function is to enforce existing laws, legislate new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. In some societies, this group is often a self-perpetuating or hereditary class. In other societies, such as [[democracies]], the political roles remain, but there is frequent turnover of the people actually filling the positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barclay, Harold|title=People Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy|publisher=Left Bank Books|year=1990|isbn=1-871082-16-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States and nation-states===
{{See also|Nation-state}}

States can also be distinguished from the concept of a &quot;[[nation]]&quot;, which refers to a large geographical area, and the people therein who perceive themselves as having a common identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=bk-aaMVGKO0C&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The state and civil society===
In the classical thought the state was identified with [[political society]] and [[civil society]] as a form of political community, while the modern thought distinguished the [[nation state]] as a political society from civil society as a form of economic society.&lt;ref name=&quot;zaleski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus in the modern thought the state is contrasted with [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrenberg, John|chapter=Civil Society and the State|title=Civil society: the critical history of an idea|publisher=NYU Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8147-2207-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=89q-NgCJZXoC&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaviraj, Sudipta|chapter=In search of civil society|editors=Kaviraj, Sudipta &amp; Khilnani, Sunil|title=Civil society: history and possibilities|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-00290-5|pages=291–293|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AOnRSNob2O8C&amp;pg=PA291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reeve, Andrew|chapter=Civil society|editor=Jones, R.J.

===The man versus the state===
English philosopher, sociologist, biologist and writer Herbert Spencer wrote of the many aspects of the character of the state as opposed to the character of man in his book The Man  Versus The State. In it, Spencer details almost a Shakespearean academic analysis of the standoff and the consequences of interrelationships between the state and men who live under it.   

[[Antonio Gramsci]] believed that civil society is the primary locus of political activity because it is where all forms of &quot;identity formation, ideological struggle, the activities of intellectuals, and the construction of [[hegemony]] take place.&quot; and that civil society was the nexus connecting the economic and political sphere. Arising out of the collective actions of civil society is what Gramsci calls &quot;political society&quot;, which Gramsci differentiates from the notion of the state as a polity. He stated that politics was not a &quot;one-way process of political management&quot; but, rather, that the activities of civil organizations conditioned the activities of political parties and state institutions, and were conditioned by them in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sassoon, Anne Showstack|title=Gramsci and contemporary politics: beyond pessimism of the intellect|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-16214-2|page=70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQJgfmplQoC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Gramsci and international relations: a general perspective with examples from recent US policy towards the Third World|editor=Gill, Stephen|title=Gramsci, historical materialism and international relations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-43523-9|page=129|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Opkof1vyDAgC&amp;pg=PA129|author=Augelli, Enrico &amp; Murphy, Craig N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Althusser]] argued that civil organizations such as [[Christian church|church]], [[school]]s, and the [[family]] are part of an &quot;ideological state apparatus&quot; which complements the &quot;repressive state apparatus&quot; (such as police and military) in reproducing social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferretter, Luke|title=Louis Althusser|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-32731-2|page=85|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fn0ZLu27jVoC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Flecha, Ramon|chapter=The Educative City and Critical Education|editors=Apple, Michael W. et al.|title=The Routledge international handbook of critical education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009|page=330|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hD3qp2tvrLcC&amp;pg=PA330|isbn=978-0-415-95861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malešević, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Lc_nMFoGcYkC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas]], spoke of a [[public sphere]] that was distinct from both the economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Morrow, Raymond Allen &amp; Torres, Carlos Alberto|title=Reading Freire and Habermas: critical pedagogy and transformative social change|publisher=Teacher's College Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8077-4202-0|page=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mxge8wUpd7EC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the role that many social groups have in the development of public policy and the extensive connections between state bureaucracies and other institutions, it has become increasingly difficult to identify the boundaries of the state. [[Privatization]], [[nationalization]], and the creation of new [[regulation|regulatory]] bodies also change the boundaries of the state in relation to society. Often the nature of quasi-autonomous organizations is unclear, generating debate among political scientists on whether they are part of the state or civil society. Some political scientists thus prefer to speak of policy networks and decentralized governance in modern societies rather than of state bureaucracies and direct state control over policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kjaer, Anne Mette|title=Governance|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7456-2979-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AY5SIsf1nI4C}} -- {{page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of state function==
{{see also|Corporatism|Elite theory}}

Most political theories of the state can roughly be classified into two categories. The first are known as &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; theories, which treat [[capitalism]] as a given, and then concentrate on the function of states in capitalist society. These theories tend to see the state as a neutral entity separated from society and the economy. Marxist theories on the other hand, see politics as intimately tied in with economic relations, and emphasize the relation between economic power and [[political power]]. They see the state as a partisan instrument that primarily serves the interests of the upper class.&lt;ref name=&quot;flint-taylor-137&quot;/&gt;

===Anarchist===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] poster &quot;Pyramid of the Capitalist System&quot;(c. 1911), depicting an [[Criticism of capitalism|anti-capitalist]] perspective on statist/capitalist social structures]]
[[Anarchism]] is a [[political philosophy]] which considers the state [[morality|immoral]] and instead promotes a [[stateless society]], or [[anarchy]].

Anarchists believe that the state is inherently an instrument of domination and repression, no matter who is in control of it. Unlike Marxists, anarchists believe that revolutionary seizure of state power should not be a political goal. They believe instead that the state apparatus should be completely dismantled, and an alternative set of social relations created, which are not based on state power at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Newman, Saul|title=The Politics of Postanarchism|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7486-3495-8|page=109|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SiqBiViUsOkC&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roussopoulos, Dimitrios I.|title=The political economy of the state: Québec, Canada, U.S.A.|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1973|isbn=978-0-919618-01-5|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jzX7mCJLl9AC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the State and [[political power]] as the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]] in the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=123–126 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Revelation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchy and Christianity |last=Ellul |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Ellul |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |location=Michigan |isbn= |page= |pages=71–74 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=55_Oa12YTt0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |quote=The first beast comes up from the sea...It is given 'all authority and power over every tribe, every people, every tongue, and every nation' (13:7). All who dwell on earth worship it. Political power could hardly, I think, be more expressly described, for it is this power which has authority, which controls military force, and which compels adoration (i.e., absolute obedience).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist perspective===
[[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels|Engels]] were clear in that the communist goal was a [[classless society]] in which the state would have &quot;[[stateless communism|withered away]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm ''Frederick Engels'' - Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. 1880] Full Text. From ''[[Historical Materialism]]'': &quot;State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not &quot;abolished&quot;. It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master — free.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Their views are scattered throughout the [[Marx/Engels Collected Works]] and address past or the then extant state forms from an analytical or tactical viewpoint, not future social forms, speculation [[utopian socialism|about which]] is generally anathema to groups considering themselves Marxist but who, not having conquered the existing state power(s) are not in the situation of supplying the institutional form of an actual society. To the [[Marxism#Dispute_that_the_Soviet_Union_was_Marxist|extent that it makes sense]], there is no single &quot;Marxist theory of state&quot;, but rather many different &quot;Marxist&quot; theories that have been developed by adherents of Marxism.&lt;ref name=&quot;flint-taylor-139&quot;&gt;Flint &amp; Taylor, 2007: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=ic5UOphbKHsC&amp;pg=PA15 p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, 1993: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's early writings portrayed the state as &quot;parasitic&quot;, [[base and superstructure|built upon the superstructure]] of the [[economy]], and working against the public interest. He also wrote that the state mirrors [[social class|class]] relations in society in general, acts as a regulator and repressor of class struggle, and acts as a tool of political power and domination for the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Mark J.|title=Rethinking state theory|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-20892-5|page=176|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hFCpqJwuv1QC&amp;pg=PA176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' claimed that the state is nothing more than &quot;a committee for managing the common affairs of the ''[[bourgeoisie]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;flint-taylor-139&quot; /&gt;

For Marxist theorists, the role of the non-socialist state is determined by its function in the global capitalist order. [[Ralph Miliband]] argued that the ruling class uses the state as its instrument to dominate society by virtue of the interpersonal ties between state officials and economic elites. For Miliband, the state is dominated by an elite that comes from the same background as the capitalist class. State officials therefore share the same interests as owners of capital and are [[interlocking directorate|linked to them]] through a wide array of social, economic, and political ties.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF8&quot; /&gt;

Gramsci's theories of state emphasized that the state is only one of the institutions in society that helps maintain the [[hegemony]] of the ruling class, and that state power is bolstered by the [[false consciousness|ideological domination]] of the institutions of civil society, such as churches, schools, and mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=ic5UOphbKHsC&amp;pg=PA44: p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
[[Pluralism (political theory)|Pluralists]] view society as a collection of individuals and groups, who are competing for political power. They then view the state as a neutral body that simply enacts the will of whichever groups dominate the electoral process.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, 1992: [http://books.google.com/books?id=_MdR_fvPxZoC&amp;pg=PA47 pp. 47-48]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the pluralist tradition, [[Robert Dahl]] developed the theory of the state as a neutral arena for contending interests or its agencies as simply another set of [[interest group]]s. With power competitively arranged in society, state policy is a product of recurrent bargaining. Although pluralism recognizes the existence of inequality, it asserts that all groups have an opportunity to pressure the state. The pluralist approach suggests that the modern democratic state's actions are the result of pressures applied by a variety of organized interests. Dahl called this kind of state a [[polyarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dahl, Robert|title=Modern Political Analysis|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1973|isbn=0-13-596981-6|page={{Page needed|date=January 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluralism has been challenged on the ground that it is not supported by empirical evidence. Citing surveys showing that the large majority of people in high leadership positions are members of the wealthy upper class, critics of pluralism claim that the state serves the interests of the upper class rather than equitably serving the interests of all social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cunningham, Frank|title=Theories of democracy: a critical introduction|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-22879-4|pages=86–87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cOBubkTG9JMC&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diversity in the power elite: how it happened, why it matters|edition=2nd|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7425-3699-9|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0V0gO8tArK8C&amp;pg=PA4|author=Zweigenhaft, Richard L. &amp; Domhoff, G. William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodernists ===

[[Jürgen Habermas]] believed that the base-superstructure framework, used by many Marxist theorists to describe the relation between the state and the economy, was overly simplistic. He felt that the modern state plays a large role in structuring the economy, by regulating economic activity and being a large-scale economic consumer/producer, and through its redistributive [[welfare state]] activities. Because of the way these activities structure the economic framework, Habermas felt that the state cannot be looked at as passively responding to economic class interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Duncan, Graeme Campbell|title=Democracy and the capitalist state|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-28062-4|page=137|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tMk8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edgar, Andrew|title=The philosophy of Habermas|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7735-2783-6|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=VxfeGh-RrWwC&amp;pg=PA5 5–6]; [http://books.google.com/books?id=VxfeGh-RrWwC&amp;pg=PA44 44]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, Deborah|title=Adorno, Habermas, and the search for a rational society|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-33479-2|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lmK-RGZi5McC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] believed that modern political theory was too state-centric, saying &quot;Maybe, after all, the state is no more than a composite reality and a mythologized abstraction, whose importance is a lot more limited than many of us think.&quot; He thought that political theory was focusing too much on abstract institutions, and not enough on the actual practices of government. In Foucault's opinion, the state had no essence. He believed that instead of trying to understand the activities of governments by analyzing the properties of the state (a reified abstraction), political theorists should be examining changes in the practice of government to understand changes in the nature of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melossi, Dario|chapter=Michel Foucault and the Obsolescent State|editors=Beaulieu, Alain &amp; Gabbard, David|title=Michel Foucault and power today: international multidisciplinary studies in the history of the present|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7391-1324-0|page=6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_UBAh_cyEC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon, Colin|chapter=Government rationality: an introduction|editors=Foucault, Michel et al.|title=The Foucault effect: studies in governmentality|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-226-08045-1|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TzSt_zYZfUsC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Timothy|chapter=Society, Economy, and the State Effect|editors=Sharma, Aradhana &amp; Gupta, Akhil|title=The anthropology of the state: a reader|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1467-7|page=179|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ImnEMK_hKCgC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavily influenced by Gramsci, [[Nicos Poulantzas]], a Greek [[neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] theorist argued that capitalist states do not always act on behalf of the ruling class, and when they do, it is not necessarily the case because state officials consciously strive to do so, but because the '[[structuralism|structural]]' position of the state is configured in such a way to ensure that the long-term interests of capital are always dominant. Poulantzas' main contribution to the Marxist literature on the state was the concept of 'relative autonomy' of the state. While Poulantzas' work on 'state autonomy' has served to sharpen and specify a great deal of Marxist literature on the state, his own framework came under criticism for its '[[structural functionalism]].'{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===State autonomy (institutionalism)===
{{Main|New institutionalism}}

State autonomy theorists believe that the state is an entity that is impervious to external social and economic influence, and has interests of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;sklair-2004-139-140&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sklair, Leslie|chapter=Globalizing class theory|editor=Sinclair, Timothy|title=Global governance: critical concepts in political science|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-27665-8|pages=139–140|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1xs_MGAo3zgC&amp;pg=PA139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;New institutionalist&quot; writings on the state, such as the works of [[Theda Skocpol]], suggest that state actors are to an important degree autonomous. In other words, state personnel have interests of their own, which they can and do pursue independently of (at times in conflict with) actors in society. Since the state controls the means of coercion, and given the dependence of many groups in civil society on the state for achieving any goals they may espouse, state personnel can to some extent impose their own preferences on civil society.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF10&quot; /&gt;

[[G. William Domhoff]] claims that &quot;The idea of the American state having any significant degree of autonomy from the owners and managers of [[bank]]s, [[corporations]], and [[agribusinesses]] is a theoretical mistake based in [[empirical]] inaccuracies,&quot; and cites empirical studies showing a high degree of [[interlocking directorate|overlap]] between upper-level corporate management and high-level positions in government.&lt;ref name=&quot;sklair-2004-139-140&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sklair, Leslie|title=The transnational capitalist class|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-22462-4|page=12|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AhERHMzaCr0C&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of state legitimacy==
{{Main|Legitimacy (political science)}}
{{See also|Social contract|State of nature}}

States generally rely on a claim to some form of [[legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] in order to maintain domination over their subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;vincent-1992-43&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malešević, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Lc_nMFoGcYkC&amp;pg=PA85 p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dogan, 1992: [http://books.google.com/books?id=_MdR_fvPxZoC&amp;pg=PA119 pp. 119-120]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine right===
{{Main|Divine right of kings}}
The rise of the modern state system was closely related to changes in political thought, especially concerning the changing understanding of legitimate state power. Early modern defenders of absolutism such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean Bodin]] undermined the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]] by arguing that the power of kings should be justified by reference to the people. Hobbes in particular went further and argued that political power should be justified with reference to the individual, not just to the people understood collectively. Both Hobbes and Bodin thought they were defending the power of kings, not advocating democracy, but their arguments about the nature of sovereignty were fiercely resisted by more traditional defenders of the power of kings, like [[Sir Robert Filmer]] in England, who thought that such defenses ultimately opened the way to more democratic claims.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Rational-legal authority===
{{Main|Rational-legal authority}}

Max Weber identified three main sources of political legitimacy in his works. The first, legitimacy based on traditional grounds is derived from a belief that things should be as they have been in the past, and that those who defend these traditions have a legitimate claim to power. The second, legitimacy based on charismatic leadership is devotion to a leader or group that is viewed as exceptionally heroic or virtuous. The third is [[rational-legal authority]], whereby legitimacy is derived from the belief that a certain group has been placed in power in a legal manner, and that their actions are justifiable according to a specific code of written laws. Weber believed that the modern state is characterized primarily by appeals to rational-legal authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallerstein, Immanuel|title=The end of the world as we know it: social science for the twenty-first century|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8166-3398-2|page=228|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PEmVAQ_HMc8C&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Collins, Randall|title=Weberian Sociological Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-521-31426-8|page=158|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v39x_fKR-ykC&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Max Weber dictionary: key words and central concepts|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8047-5095-0|page=148|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&amp;pg=PA148|author=Swedberg, Richard &amp; Agevall, Ola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word '''''state''''' and its cognates in other European languages (''stato'' in Italian, ''Estado'' in Spanish ''état'' in French, ''Staat'' in German) ultimately derive from the Latin ''status'', meaning &quot;condition&quot; or &quot;status.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 2001: [http://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1469 p. 1469]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the revival of the [[Roman law]] in the 14th century in Europe, this Latin term was used to refer to the legal standing of persons (such as the various &quot;[[estates of the realm]]&quot; - noble, common, and clerical), and in particular the special status of the king. The word was also associated with Roman ideas (dating back to [[Cicero]]) about the &quot;''status [[res publica|rei publicae]]''&quot;, the &quot;condition of public matters&quot;. In time, the word lost its reference to particular social groups and became associated with the legal order of the entire society and the apparatus of its enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, 1989: {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, &quot;state&quot; is a contraction of the word &quot;estate&quot;, which is similar to the [[old French]] ''estat'' and the modern [[French language|French]] ''état'', both of which signify that a person has status and therefore estate. The highest estates, generally those with the most wealth and social rank, were those that held power.&lt;ref name=&quot;vincent-1992-43&quot;&gt;Vincent, 1992: [http://books.google.com/books?id=_MdR_fvPxZoC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 16th century works of [[Machiavelli]] (especially ''[[The Prince]]'') played a central role in popularizing the use of the word &quot;state&quot; in something similar to its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1989: [http://books.google.com/books?id=4AE8ur83g8AC&amp;pg=PA57 pp.57-58]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest forms of the state emerged whenever it became possible to centralize power in a durable way. [[Agriculture]] and [[writing]] are almost everywhere associated with this process: agriculture because it allowed for the emergence of a class of people who did not have to spend most of their time providing for their own subsistence, and writing (or the equivalent of writing, like [[Inca]] [[quipu]]s) because it made possible the centralization of vital information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddens&quot; /&gt;

The first known states were created in [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient China|China]], the Americas (e.g. [[Aztec civilization]], [[Inca civilization]]) and others, but it is only in relatively [[Modern Era|modern times]] that states have almost completely displaced alternative &quot;[[Stateless society|stateless]]&quot; forms of political organization of societies all over the [[Earth|planet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOCW&quot;/&gt; Roving bands of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and even fairly sizable and complex [[tribal society|tribal societies]] based on [[herding]] or [[agriculture]] have existed without any full-time specialized state organization, and these &quot;stateless&quot; forms of political organization have in fact prevailed for all of the [[prehistory]] and much of the [[History of the world|history of the human species]] and [[civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOCW&quot;/&gt;

Initially states emerged over territories built by conquest in which one culture, one set of ideals and [[law|one set of laws]] have been imposed by force or threat over diverse [[nation]]s by a [[Civil authority|civilian]] and [[Military organization|military]] [[bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOCW&quot;&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/states.htm Nations Online, Countries of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, that is not always the case and there are [[multinational state]]s, [[federated state]]s and [[autonomous area]]s within states. 

Since the late 19th century, virtually the entirety of the world's inhabitable land has been parcelled up into areas with more or less definite borders claimed by various states. Earlier, quite large land areas had been either unclaimed or uninhabited, or inhabited by [[nomad]]ic peoples who were [[Stateless society|not organised as states]]. However, even within present-day states there are vast areas of wilderness, like the [[Amazon Rainforest]], which are uninhabited or inhabited solely or mostly by [[indigenous people]] (and some of them remain [[uncontacted people|uncontacted]]). Also, there are states which do not hold de facto control over all of their claimed territory or where this control is challenged. Currently the international community comprises around 200 [[sovereign states]], the vast majority of which are represented in the [[United Nations]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Pre-historic stateless societies===
{{Main|Stateless societies}}
For most of human history, people have lived in [[stateless societies]], characterized by a lack of concentrated authority, and the absence of large [[social inequality|inequalities]] in economic and [[political power]].

The [[anthropologist]] [[Robert L. Carneiro]] comments:
:&quot;For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]] [i.e. the [[stone age]]], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 B.C. it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three [[Millennium|millenia]] the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157. In the light of this trend, the continued decrease from 157 to 1 seems not only inescapable but close at hand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Carneiro, &quot;Political expansion as an expression of the principle of competitive exclusion&quot;, p. 219 in: Ronald Cohen and Elman R. Service (eds.), ''Origins of the State: The Anthropology of Political Evolution''. Philadelphia: Institute for the Study of Human Issues, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]] writes:
:&quot;It is not enough to observe, in a now rather dated anthropological idiom, that [[hunter gatherers]] live in 'stateless societies', as though their social lives were somehow lacking or unfinished, waiting to be completed by the evolutionary development of a state apparatus. Rather, the principal of their socialty, as [[Pierre Clastres]] has put it, is fundamentally ''against'' the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ingold, Tim|chapter=On the social relations of the hunter-gatherer band|editors=Lee, Richard B. &amp; Daly, Richard Heywood|title=The Cambridge encyclopedia of hunters and gatherers|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-57109-8|page=408|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5eEASHGLg3MC&amp;pg=PA408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Neolithic period===
{{Main|Neolithic}}

During the [[Neolithic]] period, human societies underwent major cultural and economic changes, including the development of [[agriculture]], the formation of sedentary societies and fixed settlements, increasing population densities, and the use of pottery and more complex tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaw, Ian &amp; Jameson, Robert|chapter=Neolithic|title=A dictionary of archaeology|edition=6th|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-23583-5|page=423|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zmvNogJO2ZgC&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hassan, F.A.|chapter=The Lie of History: Nation-States and the Contradictions of Complex Societies|editors=Costanza, Robert et al.|title=Sustainability or collapse?: an integrated history and future of people on earth|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-262-03366-4|page=186|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8tMxW_7geWUC&amp;pg=PA186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedentary agriculture led to the development of [[property rights]], [[patriarchal]] societies, [[domestication]] of plants and animals, and larger family sizes.  It also provided the basis for the centralized state form&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=oiLYu2-uc8IC&amp;pg=PT29 p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; by producing a large surplus of food, which created a more complex [[division of labor]] by enabling people to specialize in tasks other than food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Agricultural systems|editor=Stearns, Peter N.|title=Encyclopedia of social history|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-0342-8|page=28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA28|author=Langer, Erick D. &amp; Stearns, Peter N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early states were characterized by highly [[social stratification|stratified]] societies, with a privileged and wealthy ruling class that was subordinate to a [[monarch]]. The ruling classes began to differentiate themselves through forms of architecture and other cultural practices that were different from those of the subordinate laboring classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cohen, Ronald|chapter=State Origins: A Reappraisal|title=The Early State|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1978|isbn=978-90-279-7904-9|page=36|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, it was suggested that the centralized state was developed to administer large public works systems (such as irrigation systems) and to regulate complex economies. However, modern archaeological and anthropological evidence doesn't support this thesis, pointing to the existence of several non-stratified and politically decentralized complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roosevelt, Anna C.|chapter=The Maritime, Highland, Forest Dynamic and the Origins of Complex Culture|editors=Salomon, Frank &amp; Schwartz, Stuart B.|title=Cambridge history of the Native peoples of the Americas: South America, Volume 3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-63075-7|pages=266–267|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hxqgDcCrzjkC&amp;pg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The state in classical antiquity===
{{See also|Athenian democracy|Roman Republic}}
[[File:Karl Theodor von Piloty Murder of Caesar 1865.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Painting of Roman Senators encircling [[Julius Caesar]]]]
Although primitive state-forms existed before the rise of the Ancient Greek empire, the Greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions. Prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 2006: [http://books.google.com/books?id=cvtYZmiOjT8C&amp;pg=PA17 p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important political innovations of [[classical antiquity]] came from the [[ancient Greece|Greek city-states]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Republic]]. The Greek city-states before the 4th century granted [[Athenian democracy#Citizenship in Athens|citizenship]] rights to their free population, and in [[Athens]] these rights [[Athenian democracy|were combined]] with a [[direct democracy|directly democratic]] form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history.

===The Feudal state===
{{See also|Feudalism|Middle ages}}
During Medieval times in Europe, the state was organized on the principle of [[feudalism]], and the relationship between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] became central to social organization. Feudalism led to the development of greater social hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jones, Rhys|title=People/states/territories: the political geographies of British state transformation|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-4033-1|pages=52–53|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7OgODkcZgIIC&amp;pg=PA52}} ... see also [http://books.google.com/books?id=7OgODkcZgIIC&amp;pg=PA54 pp. 54-...] where Jones discusses problems with common conceptions of feudalism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formalization of the struggles over taxation between the monarch and other elements of society (especially the nobility and the cities) gave rise to what is now called the [[Standestaat]], or the state of Estates, characterized by parliaments in which key social groups negotiated with the king about legal and economic matters. These [[estates of the realm]] sometimes evolved in the direction of fully-fledged parliaments, but sometimes lost out in their struggles with the monarch, leading to greater centralization of lawmaking and military power in his hands. Beginning in the 15th century, this centralizing process gives rise to the [[political absolutism|absolutist]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poggi&quot; /&gt;

===The modern state===
{{See also|Bureaucracy|Constitution|Corporation|Globalization|Neoliberalism}}

Cultural and national homogenization figured prominently in the rise of the modern state system. Since the absolutist period, states have largely been organized on a [[nation]]al basis. The concept of a national state, however, is not synonymous with [[nation state]]. Even in the most [[ethnic]]ally homogeneous societies there is not always a complete correspondence between state and [[nation]], hence the active role often taken by the state to promote [[nationalism]] through emphasis on shared symbols and national identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breuilly&quot; /&gt;
