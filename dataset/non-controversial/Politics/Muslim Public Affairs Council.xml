The '''Muslim Public Affairs Council''' ('''MPAC''') is a national [[United States|American]] [[Muslim]] advocacy and public policy organization headquartered in [[Los Angeles]] and with offices in [[Washington D.C.]] MPAC was founded in 1986.

MPAC has participated in a number of coalitions and networks, and worked with [[Japanese-American]] organizations.

==History==
MPAC was founded in 1986 as the &quot;Political Action Committee of the Islamic Center of Southern California&quot;. It was later renamed in 1988 to the &quot;Muslim Public Affairs Council.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MPAC Timeline&quot;&gt;[http://www.mpac.org/about/timeline/ MPAC Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its history, it has condemned the death fatwa against [[Salman Rushdie]] and the attacks on the [[World Trade Center]], and denounced the [[Taliban]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MPAC Timeline&quot;/&gt;

Statement by President Salam al-Marayati, regarding the [[September_11_attacks|September 11, 2001 terror attacks]]:  “If we’re going to look at suspects, we should look to the groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents, and I think we should put the state of [[Israel]] on the suspect list because I think this diverts attention from what’s happening in the Palestinian territories so that they can go on with their aggression and occupation and apartheid policies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/17/watchdogs-oppose-appointment-israel-critic-al-marayati-to-us-delegation/#ixzz29eADtc9A Selection of Israel critic for US delegation to human rights forum raises concern]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahdi Bray]] formerly was political director of MPAC.&lt;ref name=MPACevent&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/archives/july01/0107082.html MPAC Hosts White House Office and National Interfaith Leaders], Muslim-American Activism section of [[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]], July, 2001, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delinda C. Hanley, [http://www.wrmea.com/archives/janfeb2002/0201016.html Freeze on Jewish Defense League Assets Called for After JDL Bomb Plot Foiled], [[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]], January/February 2002, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Envisioning Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict==
Calling it the &quot;most complicated and intractable (issue) of our time&quot; MPAC recommends a peaceful solution which will lead to coexistence and mutual respect.  &quot;The Muslim Public Affairs Council believes that this dialogue will lead to a strategy to end this conflict that has taken too many lives and has destabilized an entire region of global significance.&quot;  Their position paper states:.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mpac.org/publications/envisioning-peace | title=Envisioning Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#&quot; At MPAC’s core is an Islamic sensibility that human beings should conduct their lives in accordance with a higher ethical and moral wisdom, tested through the ages and designed to afford maximum dignity and justice to human life. It is these ideals shared by our friends in the interfaith community, that we appeal to as we continue to travel the extremely difficult road of peace between Israelis and Palestinians.&quot;
#&quot;In addition to offering our position as stated above as clearly as possible with the hopes of facilitating fruitful and honest dialogue and strategizing, we conclude by offering principles for the pro-Israel camp to engage with us in the future in a manner that we believe will yield better results enabling us to have a positive influence on the peace process.&quot;

==Actions against terrorism==
MPAC started &quot;The National Grassroots Campaign to Fight Terrorism&quot; by providing guidelines to American Muslim community leaders to ensure that Mosques are not used by potential terrorists and to monitor activities inside Mosques.  This program is instituted in cooperation with Mosques across this great country to regulate what kind of groups may assemble in a Mosque and inform the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] if any suspicious activity takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mpac.org/ngcft/|title=National Grassroot Campaign Against Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Large publications have taken a note of MPAC's activities to prevent terrorism on American soil. The [[Wall Street Journal]] praised American Muslims for being &quot;part of the solution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpac.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mpac.org/ngcft/in-the-news/index.php |title=Media Takes Notes of Muslim's efforts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] said to &quot;credit Muslims who speak out&quot; against terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpac.org&quot;/&gt;

==Response to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot==
{{main|2006 transatlantic aircraft plot}}
On August 10, 2006 the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London Metropolitan Police]] announced that it had arrested key suspects in a terrorist plot to detonate bombs on a number of flights from the UK to cities in the U.S. and that the plot had been disrupted &lt;ref name =&quot;BBC-statements&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Ministers' statements in full|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=August 10, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4778817.stm | date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was &quot;getting close to the execution phase&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-SecurityChief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=CNN.com|title= Security chief: Airline terror plot 'close to execution'|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 10, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/10/us.security/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Dry Run (testing)|dry run]] planned within two days of the arrests according to U.S. intelligence officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lare Jakes Jordan|title=U.S. posts code-red alert; bans liquids|publisher=AP|accessdate=August 10, 2006|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/politics/4108668.html}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; High security measures were put in place at all UK airports, including a banning of all non-essential hand luggage. Security was also increased at many airports around the world, with a large number of flights into the UK being cancelled.

A few hours later [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] said the plot was &quot;a stark reminder that this nation is at war with [[Islamofascism|Islamic fascists]] who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom, to hurt our nation.&quot;

Both the MPAC and the [[Council on American Islamic Relations]] criticized the use of the term 'Islamic fascism.' [[Edina Lekovic]], spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in [[Los Angeles]], said, &quot;The problem with the phrase is it attaches the religion of [[Islam]] to [[tyranny]] and [[fascism]], rather than isolating the threat to a specific group of individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amanda Beck|title=US Muslims bristle at Bush term &quot;Islamic fascists&quot;|publisher=Red Orbit|accessdate=August 10, 2006|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/610858/us_muslims_bristle_at_bush_term_islamic_fascists/index.html?source=r_general}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==Position on terrorism and extremism==
MPAC states opposition to [[religious extremism]], criticizing the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and supporting [[gender equality]]. During the 2005 [[ISNA]] convention they presented [[anti-terrorism]] information.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}--&gt;

==Coordination==
MPC is also a member of the American Muslim Political Coordination Council (AMPCC), along with the American Muslim Alliance (AMA), [[American Muslim Council]] (AMC), and [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR).  AMPCC's primary concern is to coordinate the member organizations on activism and lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPhYhcvxwAcC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=cair+%22Council+on+American-Islamic+Relations%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=H4gTS-SwMZSGzQT0vM3qDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cair%20%22Council%20on%20American-Islamic%20Relations%22&amp;f=false ''Arab-American faces and voices: the origins of an immigrant community'', p. 261, Elizabeth Boosahda, [[University of Texas Press]], 2003, ISBN 0-292-70920-X, 9780292709201, accessed November 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
