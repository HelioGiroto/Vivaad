'''Green anarchism''', or '''ecoanarchism''', is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American {{Citation needed span|text=[[anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]]|date=August 2012}} and his book ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;&gt;&quot;Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html &quot;LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA. EL ANARQUISMO INDIVIDUALISTA ESPAÑOL DURANTE LA DICTADURA Y LA SEGUNDA REPÚBLICA (1923-1938)&quot; by Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century there emerged [[anarcho-naturism]] as the fusion of anarchism and [[naturism|naturist]] philosophies within [[individualist anarchist]] circles in France, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spanishind&quot;&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html &quot;LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA.

Some contemporary green anarchists can be described as [[anarcho-primitivist]]s (or anti-[[civilization]] anarchists), though not all green anarchists are primitivists. Likewise, there is a strong critique of modern technology among green anarchists, though not all reject it entirely. Important contemporary currents are [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[social ecology]].

==Background==

===Henry David Thoreau===
[[File:Henry David Thoreau.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Henry David Thoreau]], influential early [[green-anarchist]] who wrote ''[[Walden]]'']]Anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of American [[anarchist]] and [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]]. In his book ''[[Walden]]'' he advocates [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]] this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid XIX century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;/&gt;

Several anarchists, including [[Herbert Read]], [[Ethel Mannin]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;Robert Graham, ''Anarchism Volume Two: The Anarchist Current (1939-2006)''.
Black Rose Books, 2009 ISBN 1551643103, (p.72-5, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt; also held proto-environmental
views linked to their anarchism. Mannin's 1944 book ''Bread and Roses: A Utopian Survey and Blue-Print'' has been described by anarchist historian [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]] as setting forth &quot;an [[ecological]] vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive [[Industrial society|industrial]] organization of society&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt;

===Anarcho-naturism===
{{Main|Anarcho-naturism}}
In the late 19th century Anarchist naturism appeared as the union of [[anarchist]] and [[naturist]] philosophies.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;&gt;[http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf#search=%22Antonia%20Maym%C3%B3n%22 EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939) by Jose Maria Rosello]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related.&quot;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html &quot;Anarchism - Nudism, Naturism&quot; by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900's nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life. In the 1920's the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity.&quot;[http://www.radical.org.uk/nudism/radical.htm &quot;Nudism the radical tradition&quot; by Terry Phillips]&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly it had importance within [[individualist anarchist]] circles&lt;ref name=&quot;spanishind&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aujourdhui&quot;&gt;&quot;Les anarchistes individualistes du début du siècle l'avaient bien compris, et intégraient le naturisme dans leurs préoccupations. Il est vraiment dommage que ce discours se soit peu à peu effacé, d'antan plus que nous assistons, en ce moment, à un retour en force du puritanisme (conservateur par essence).&quot;[http://ytak.club.fr/natytak.html &quot;Anarchisme et naturisme, aujourd'hui.&quot; by Cathy Ytak]&lt;/ref&gt; in Spain,&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spanishind&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ortega&quot;/&gt; France,&lt;ref name=&quot;spanishind&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;france&quot;&gt;[http://ytak.club.fr/natbiblioarmand.html Recension des articles de l'En-Dehors consacrés au naturisme et au nudisme]&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal,&lt;ref name=&quot;portugal&quot;&gt;[&quot;Anarchisme et naturisme au Portugal, dans les années 1920&quot; in ''Les anarchistes du Portugal''
by João Freire]&lt;/ref&gt; and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;The historian Kirwin R. Schaffer in his study of cuban anarchism reports anarcho-naturism as &quot;A third strand within the island’s anarchist movement&quot; alongside [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]][http://raforum.info/spip.php?article3061&amp;lang=fr Introduction to ''Anarchism and countercultural politics in early twentieth-century Cuba'' by Kirwin R. Shaffer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Important influences were [[Henry David Thoreau]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;/&gt; and [[Elisee Reclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reclus1&quot;&gt;[http://www.natustar.com/uk/naturism-begin.html &quot;The pioneers&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-naturism advocated [[vegetarianism]], [[free love]], [[nudism]] and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aujourdhui&quot;/&gt;
Anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small [[ecovillage]]s, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;&gt;&quot;EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939)&quot; by Josep Maria Rosell&lt;/ref&gt; Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and tried to eliminate social determinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;&gt;&quot;el individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939)&quot; by Josep Maria Rosell]&lt;/ref&gt;  Important promoters of this were [[Henri Zisly]] and [[Emile Gravelle]] who collaborated in ''La Nouvelle Humanité'' followed by ''Le Naturien'', ''Le Sauvage'', ''L'Ordre Naturel'', &amp; ''La Vie Naturelle'' &lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo2&quot;&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/1121.htm The daily bleed]&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in France but also in Spain where [[Federico Urales]] ([[pseudonym]] of Joan Montseny), promotes the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in ''[[La Revista Blanca]]'' (1898–1905).&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo1&quot;&gt;[http://www.nodo50.org/lagarbancitaecologica/garbancita/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150:los-origenes-del-naturismo-libertario&amp;catid=61:investigacion-formacion-debate&amp;Itemid=77 &quot;Los origenes del naturismo libertario&quot; por Agustín Morán]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]] this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid XIX century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;/&gt; [[John Zerzan]] himself included the text &quot;Excursions&quot; (1863) by Thoreau in his edited compilation of anti-civilization writings called ''Against civilization: Readings and reflections'' from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.fr/dp/toc/0922915989 'Against civilization: Readings and reflections' by [[John Zerzan&amp;#93; (editor)&amp;#93;]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html &quot;Anarchism - Nudism, Naturism&quot; by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The linking role played by the ‘Sol y Vida’ group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). “I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.”&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo.org&quot;/&gt;

This ecological tendency in spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]&amp;ndash;[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] in Spain. So [[Daniel Guérin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports how &quot;Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called &quot;[[affinity group]]s.&quot; There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, &quot;unsuited to industrialization.&quot; As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html ''Anarchism: From theory to practice'' by [[Daniel Guérin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary developments==
Contemporary Green anarchism incorporates a set of related [[political theory|political theories]] that is derived from or inspired by [[philosophical movement|philosophical]] and [[social movement]]s such as [[Anarcho-primitivism]], [[Eco-socialism]], [[Deep Ecology]], [[Social Ecology]], [[Feminism]], [[Egoist anarchism|Egoism]], [[post-left anarchy|Post- and Anti-leftists]], [[Situationist International|Situationists]], [[Surrealism]], [[Neo-Luddism]] and [[anti-industrialism]].

Although green anarchism develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], when primitivism emerged it was influenced more directly by the works of theorists such as the [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxists]] [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]; [[anthropologists]] [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee]]; and others such as [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Gary Snyder]]. Many advocates of Green anarchism and primitivism consider [[Fredy Perlman]] as the modern progenitor of their views.

Notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include those critical of technology such as [[Derrick Jensen]], George Draffan, and [[John Zerzan]]; the techno-positive [[Murray Bookchin]]; and others including [[Alan Carter (philosopher)|Alan Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction |last=Ward |first=Colin |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-280477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarcho-primitivism ===
{{Main|Anarcho-primitivism}}
[[File:John Zerzan SF - Anarchist Bookfair '06.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[John Zerzan]], anarcho-primitivism theorist]]Anarcho-primitivism is an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-&quot;civilized&quot; ways of life through [[deindustrialisation]], abolition of the [[division of labour]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], and abandonment of large-scale organization [[technology|technologies]]. There are other non-anarchist forms of primitivism, and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern, civilized problems. Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of achieving a [[feral]] state of being through &quot;[[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]]&quot;.

===Social ecology and communalism===
{{Main|Social ecology}}
{{Main|Communalism (Political Philosophy)}}
[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–120 |publisher=Black Rose Books |location= |isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called &quot;[[Communalism (Political Philosophy)|Communalism]]&quot; (spelled with a capital &quot;C&quot; to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[Social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[Libertarian Municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics -especially municipal elections- as long as candidates are [[libertarian socialist]] and anti-statist in outlook.

Economically, [[Communalism]] favours the abolition of markets and money and the transition to an economy similar to [[libertarian communism]] and according to the principle &quot;from each according to ability, to each according to need.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Vegan anarchism ===
{{Main|Veganarchism}}
[[Veganarchism]] or vegan anarchism, is the [[political philosophy]] of [[veganism]] (more specifically [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] and [[earth liberation]]) and [[anarchism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;alfsgjonny&quot;&gt;Alberwite, Jonny.

''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses viewing the [[State (polity)|state]] as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both [[human]] and [[non-human]], whilst practising a vegan lifestyle. It is either perceived as a combined theory, or that both philosophies are essentially  the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, inside page.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further described as an [[anti-speciesist]] perspective on green anarchism, or an anarchist perspective on animal liberation.&lt;ref name=&quot;page5&quot; /&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Civilization===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rouge clearcut.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A forest harvest site in the Rouge Valley of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], shown before re-growth. Clearcuts are a prime example of what green anarchists consider to be capitalism's effect on the environment.{{Deletable image-caption|Saturday, 18 July 2009|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;

The green anarchist [[critique]] focuses on the institutions of domination that make up [[society]], all grouped under the broad term &quot;civilization&quot;. Such institutions include the [[State (polity)|state]], [[capitalism]], [[Industrial society|industrialism]], [[globalization]], [[domestication]], [[patriarchy]], [[science]], [[technology]], and/or [[Employment|work]]. These institutions, according to green anarchists, are inherently destructive and [[exploitation|exploitative]] (to humans and the environment) – therefore, they cannot be reformed into anything better. This movement generally rejects furthering their cause through current political lines, favoring [[direct action|direct and autonomous action]], [[sabotage]], [[insurrection]], [[bioregionalism]], and [[Rewilding (anarchism)|reconnecting with the wild]] to create meaningful change.

Civilization is taken to be the totality of institutions (described above) that are responsible for the destruction of human freedom and the environment. Physically, civilization is demarcated by the domestication of plants, animals, and humans (though its beginning has been traced back through time, language, art, and symbolic culture – see [[John Zerzan]]). [[Agriculture]] introduced the concept of a surplus along with the conditions for the rise of these institutions. Before agriculture, humans often lived as autonomous bands of [[hunter-gatherers]].  Essentially, hunter-gatherers are perceived to be part of human anarchist ancestry since all humans practised that mode of life for around two million years. Civilization is often seen as more of a [[paradigm]] of systems rather than a tangible thing, and one that places human beings above and outside of the natural world. This is seen as the first step towards, and justification for, the destruction of nature (humans included).

===Technology===
[[Technology]] is seen as a system rather than a specific physical tool.&lt;ref name=fpbook&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Primitive and Other Essays |last=Zerzan |first=John |publisher=Autonomedia|year=1994 |isbn=1-57027-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology, it is argued, requires the exploitation of the environment through the creation and extraction of resources, and the exploitation of people through [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[Wage labour|work]], and [[slavery]], industrialism, [[specialization (functional)|specialization]] and the [[division of labor]]. There is no &quot;neutral&quot; form of technology as things are always created in a certain context with certain aims and functions. [[Green technology]] is rejected as an attempt to reform this exploitative system, merely changing it on the surface to make it seem environmentally friendly,&lt;ref name=runningemptinessbook&gt;{{cite book |title=Running on Emptiness: The Pathology of Civilization |last=Zerzan |first=John |publisher=Feral House |year=2008 |isbn=0-922915-75-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite sustained levels of human and natural exploitation. In place of modern technology, green anarchists favor small-scale technology, using more sustainable and local resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Eco-socialism: from deep ecology to social justice |last=Pepper |first=David |publisher=Routledge|year=1993 |isbn=0-415-09719-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==

Many green anarchists argue that small [[eco-village]]s (of no more than a few hundred people) are a scale of human living preferable to civilization, and that [[infrastructure]] and [[political system]]s should be re-organized to ensure that these are created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper 1993&quot;/&gt; Green Anarchists assert that [[social organization]]s must be designed to work ''with'' natural forces, rather than against.

Many green anarchists consider traditional forms of social organization such as the village, [[Band society|band]], or [[tribe]] to be preferred units of human life, not for some [[Noble Savage]] concept of spiritual superiority, but because these social organizations appear to work better than civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Revolution |last=Theodore |first=Kaczynski |publisher=Xenia Editions|year=2008 |isbn=2-88892-065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dictionary of Alternatives |last=Parker |first=Martin |publisher=Zed Books|year=2007 |isbn=1-84277-333-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family is considered to be more important to many green anarchists than work roles. Green anarchist philosophy can be explained as an interpretation of [[anthropological]] and [[biological]] truths, or [[natural laws]].

Some green anarchists advocate a process of '[[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]]' and a return to [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles while other green anarchists only wish to see an end to industrial society and do not necessarily oppose [[domestication]] or [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/dialog.htm &quot;A Dialog on Primitivism: Lawrence Jarach interviews John Zerzan&quot;], Anarchy: A journal of Desire Armed, Issue 51&lt;/ref&gt; Key theorists in the former category include [[Derrick Jensen]] and [[John Zerzan]] while the 'Unabomber' [[Theodore Kaczynski]] belongs in the latter, though the boundaries are blurred at times, both Jensen and Zerzan making positive references to some forms of [[permaculture]].
Other green anarchists, mainly techno-positivists, propose other forms of organizations like [[arcology]] or [[technocracy|technates]].

Many green anarchists choose to focus not on philosophical issues for a future society, but on the defense of the earth and social revolution in the present. Resisting systems in the present, and creating alternative, sustainable ways of living are often deemed more important than protesting. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some Green Anarchists engage in [[direct action]], (not to be confused with [[ecoterrorism]]). Organizing themselves through groups like [[Earth First!]], [[Root Force]], or more drastically, the [[Earth Liberation Front|Earth Liberation Front (ELF)]], [[Earth Liberation Army|Earth Liberation Army (ELA)]] and [[Animal Liberation Front|Animal Liberation Front (ALF)]]. They may take direct action against what they see as [[Systematic oppression|systems of oppression]], such as the [[logging industry]], the [[Meat industry|meat]] and [[Dairy industry|dairy industries]], [[animal testing]] laboratories, [[Genetic engineering|genetic engineering facilities]] and, more rarely, government institutions.

Such actions are usually, though not always, [[non-violent]],  with groups such as [[The Olga Cell]] attempting assassinations of nuclear scientists, and other related groups sending letterbombs to nano tech and nuclear tech-related targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchists attack science, ''Nature'', May 28, 2012&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/anarchists-attack-science-1.10729]&quot;Anarchists attack science, &quot;Nature&quot;, May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Though not necessarily Green anarchists, activists have used the names [[Animal Rights Militia]], [[Justice Department (animal rights group)|Justice Department]] and [[Revolutionary Cells - Animal Liberation Brigade|Revolutionary Cells]] among others, to claim responsibility for openly violent attacks.

===Convictions===
{{Main|GANDALF trial|SHAC 7|Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty#Operation Achilles}}

[[Rod Coronado]] is an eco-anarchist and is an unofficial spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front and [[Earth Liberation Front]]. On February 28, 1992, Coronado carried out an [[arson]] attack on research facilities at [[Michigan State University]] (MSU), and released [[mink]] from a nearby research farm on campus, an action claimed by the ALF, and for which Coronado was subsequently convicted.

In 1997, the editors of ''[[Green Anarchist]]'' magazine and two British supporters of the Animal Liberation Front were tried in connection with conspiracy to incite violence, in what came to be known as the [[GANDALF trial]].
