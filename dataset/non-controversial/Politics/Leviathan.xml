[[Image:Destruction of Leviathan.png|right|250px|thumb|&quot;Destruction of Leviathan&quot;. 1865 engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

'''Leviathan''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɨ|ˈ|v|aɪ|.|ə|θ|ən}}; {{Hebrew Name|לִוְיָתָן|Livyatan|Liwyāṯān|&quot;twisted, coiled&quot;}}) is a [[sea monster]] referred to in the [[Bible]]. 

The word has become synonymous with any large [[sea monster]] or creature. In literature (e.g., [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'') it refers to great [[whale]]s, and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], it means simply &quot;whale.&quot; It is described extensively in [[Job 41]] and  mentioned in Isaiah 27:1.

==Hebrew Bible==
The  Leviathan is mentioned  six times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], with {{Bibleverse||Job|41:1-41:34|KJV}} being dedicated to describing him in detail:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2041&amp;version=NIVUK |title=Job 41:1-34, New International Version |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; No-one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a [[bridle]]?
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
:&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.
:&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
:&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
:&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
:&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
:&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
:&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Arrows do not make him flee, sling stones are like chaff to him.
:&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; A club seems to him but a piece of straw, he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
:&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing-sledge.
:&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; He makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
:&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
:&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; Nothing on earth is his equal— a creature without fear.
:&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.

In Psalm 74 God is said to &quot;break the heads of Leviathan in pieces&quot; before giving his flesh to the people of the wilderness; in Psalm 104 God is praised for having made all things, including Leviathan; and in {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|27:1|KJV}} he is called the &quot;wriggling serpent&quot; who will be killed at the end of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;google512&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons+in+the+Bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFsweXp22u&amp;sig=dztd0T9lrsBte41nWVfAQhwNjkk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hf4GTIrpK9CHcdfghLYO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Leviathan&amp;f=false |title=K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst (eds), &quot;Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible&quot;, pp.512-514 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Middle Eastern origins==
{{further|Chaoskampf|Ninurta|}}

[[Sea serpents]] feature prominently in the [[religions of the Ancient Near East|mythology of the Ancient Near East]], attested as early as the 3rd millennium BCE in [[Sumer]]ian iconography depicting the myth of the god [[Ninurta]] overcoming the [[seven-headed serpent]]. Examples of the storm god vs. sea serpent trope in the Ancient Near East can be seen with [[Baʿal]] vs. [[Yam (god)|Yam]] ([[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]]), [[Marduk]] vs. [[Tiamat]] ([[Mesopotamian mythology|Babylonian]]), and [[Atum]] vs. [[Nehebkau]] ([[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]]) among others, with attestations as early as the 2nd millennium as seen on [[Syrian]] seals.

In the [[Ugarit]]ic texts [[Lotan]], or possibly another of Yam's helpers, is given the epithets &quot;wriggling serpent&quot; and &quot;mighty one with the seven heads.&quot; [[Isaiah]] 27:1 uses the first of these phrases to describe Leviathan (although in this case the name &quot;Leviathan&quot; apparently refers to an unnamed historical/political enemy of Israel rather than the original serpent-monster).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In [[Psalm]] 104, Leviathan is not described as harmful in any way, but simply as a creature of the ocean, part of God's creation. It is possible that the authors of the [[Book of Job|Job]] 41:2-26, on the other hand, based the Leviathan on descriptions of Egyptian animal mythology where the crocodile is the enemy of the solar deity [[Horus]] (and is subdued either by Horus, or by the [[Pharaoh]]). This is in contrast to typical descriptions of the sea monster trope in terms of mythological combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;google512&quot;/&gt;

==In later Jewish literature==
[[Image:Lev-Beh-Ziz.jpg|thumb|300px|Leviathan the sea-monster, with [[Behemoth]] the land-monster and [[Ziz]] the air-monster. &quot;And on that day were two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the abysses of the ocean over the fountains of the waters. But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied with his breast a waste wilderness named Duidain.&quot;
(1 Enoch 60:7-8)]]

Later Jewish sources describe Leviathan as a dragon who lives over the Sources of the Deep and who, along with the male land-monster [[Behemoth]], will be served up to the righteous at the end of time.

When the Jewish [[midrash]] (explanations of the Bible) were being composed, it was held that God originally produced a male and a female leviathan, but lest in multiplying the species should destroy the world, he slew the female, reserving her flesh for the banquet that will be given to the righteous on the advent of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] (B. B. 74b).

[[Rashi|Rashi's]] commentary on Genesis 1:21 repeats the tradition: &quot;God created the great sea monsters - [[Tannin (demon)|tanin]]im.&lt;ref&gt;In Modern Hebrew, &quot;tanin&quot; (תנין) is used as the word for [[crocodile]], but that was clearly not the sense of earlier uses of the word&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend this refers to the Leviathan and its mate. God created a male and female Leviathan, then killed the female and salted it for the righteous, for if the Leviathans were to procreate the world could not stand before them.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chabad|title=Rashi's Commentary on Genesis|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165/showrashi/true|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Talmud]] ''[[Baba Bathra]] 74b'' it is told that the Leviathan will be slain and its flesh served as a feast to the righteous in [the] Time to Come, and its skin used to cover the tent where the banquet will take place. The festival of [[Sukkot]] (Festival of Booths) therefore concludes with a prayer recited upon leaving the ''sukkah'' (booth): &quot;May it be your will, Lord our God and God of our forefathers, that just as I have fulfilled and dwelt in this sukkah, so may I merit in the coming year to dwell in ''the sukkah of the skin of Leviathan.'' Next year in Jerusalem.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkel|first=Avraham|title=The Essence of the Holy Days|year=1993|isbn=0-87668-524-6|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous size of the Leviathan is described by [[R. Johanan]], from whom proceeded nearly all the aggadot concerning this monster: &quot;Once we went in a ship and saw a fish which put his head out of the water. He had horns upon which was written: 'I am one of the meanest creatures that inhabit the sea. I am three hundred miles in length, and enter this day into the jaws of the Leviathan'&quot; (B. B. l.c.).

When the Leviathan is hungry, reports R. Dimi in the name of R. Johanan, he sends forth from his mouth a heat so great as to make all the waters of the deep boil, and if he would put his head into Paradise no living creature could endure the odor of him (ib.). His abode is the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; and the waters of the [[Jordan]] fall into his mouth (Bek. 55b; B. B. l.c.).

In a legend recorded in the Midrash called ''Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer'' it is stated that the fish which swallowed [[Jonah]] narrowly avoided being eaten by the Leviathan, which eats one whale each day.

The body of the Leviathan, especially his eyes, possesses great illuminating power. This was the opinion of R. Eliezer, who, in the course of a voyage in company with R. Joshua, explained to the latter, when frightened by the sudden appearance of a brilliant light, that it probably proceeded from the eyes of the Leviathan. He referred his companion to the words of [[Book of Job|Job]] xli. 18: &quot;By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning&quot; (B. B. l.c.). However, in spite of his supernatural strength, the leviathan is afraid of a small worm called &quot;kilbit&quot;, which clings to the [[gill]]s of large fish and kills them (Shab. 77b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsch |first=Emil G. |coauthors=Kaufmann Kohler, Solomon Schechter and Isaac Broydé |title=Leviathan and Behemoth |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=275&amp;letter=L |date= |work=JewishEncyclopedia.com |publisher= |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century [[piyyut]] (religious poem), ''[[Akdamut]]'', recited on ''[[Shavuot]]'' (Pentecost), it is envisioned that, ultimately, God will slaughter the Leviathan, which is described as having &quot;mighty fins&quot; (and, therefore, a kosher fish, not an inedible snake or crocodile), and it will be served as a sumptuous banquet for all the righteous in Heaven.

==Christianity==
The Leviathan of the Middle Ages was used as an image of [[Satan]], endangering both God's creatures—by attempting to eat them—and God's creation—by threatening it with upheaval in the waters of Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Labriola |first = Albert C. | editor-first = John | editor-last = Mulryan | title = Milton and the Middle Ages | publisher = Bucknell University Press | year = 1982 | location =  | pages = 115–34 | chapter = The Medieval View of History in ''Paradise Lost'' | url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=0YX1AKt4gn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Milton+and+the+Middle+Ages++By+John+Mulryan#v=onepage&amp;q=Leviathan&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-8387-5036-0}} P. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] described Leviathan as the demon of [[envy]], first in punishing the corresponding sinners. (Secunda Secundae Question 36) Leviathan became associated with, and may  originally have referred to, the visual motif of the [[Hellmouth]], a monstrous animal into whose mouth the damned disappear at the [[Last Judgement]], found in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] from about 800, and later all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Devil: A Mask Without a Face |last=Link |first=Luther  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Reaktion Books |location= |isbn=0-948462-67-1 |page= |pages=75–6 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EU7Qt5HSmHAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=Hellmouth+Leviathan&amp;ct=result#PPA75,M1 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Infernal Imagery in Anglo-Saxon Charters (thesis) |last=Hofmann |first=Petra  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=St Andrews |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=143–4 |url=http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/498/5/Petra+Hofmann+PhD+thesis.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Young Earth creationist]] opinion is that Leviathan and [[Behemoth]] are names given to dinosaurs which existed in Biblical times.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesispark.com/genpark/bible/bible.htm |title=Genesis Park, Room 1: The Dinosaurs |publisher=Genesispark.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Paul S. |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v3/n2/dinosaurs-alive-after-babel |title=Were Dinosaurs alive after Babel? |publisher=Answersingenesis.org |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leviathan in Satanism==
In [[Satanism]], according to the author of ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', [[Anton Szandor LaVey]], Leviathan represents the element of [[Water (classical element)|Water]] and the direction of West. The element of Water in Satanism is associated with life and creation, and may be represented by a Chalice during ritual. In ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', Leviathan is listed as one of the [[Four Crown Princes of Hell]]. This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from ''[[The Book of Abramelin|The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage]]''. The [[Church of Satan]] uses the Hebrew letters at each of the points of the [[Sigil of Baphomet]] to represent Leviathan. Starting from the lowest point of the pentagram, and reading counter-clockwise, the word reads &quot;לִוְיָתָן&quot;. Translated, this is (LVIThN) Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=The History of the Origin of the Sigil of Baphomet and its Use in the Church of Satan |url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/BaphometSigil.html |date= |work=Church of Satan website |publisher= |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Demonology]], the Leviathan is one of the [[seven princes of Hell|seven princes]] of [[Hell]] and its gatekeeper (see [[Hellmouth]]).
