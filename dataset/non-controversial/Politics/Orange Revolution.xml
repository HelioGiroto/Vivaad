The '''Orange Revolution''' ({{lang-uk|Помаранчева революція, ''Pomarancheva revolyutsiya''}}) was a series of [[protest]]s and political events that took place in [[Ukraine]] from late November 2004 to January 2005, in the immediate aftermath of the run-off vote of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption, voter intimidation and direct [[electoral fraud]]. [[Kiev]], the Ukrainian capital, was the focal point of the movement's campaign of [[civil resistance]], with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson, “Ukraine's 'Orange Revolution' of 2004: The Paradoxes of Negotiation”, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 295-316.[http://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationwide, the democratic revolution was highlighted by a series of acts of [[civil disobedience]], [[sit-in]]s, and [[general strike]]s organized by the opposition movement.

The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were rigged by the authorities in favor of the latter.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Paul Quinn-Judge, Yuri Zarakhovich, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901041206-832153,00.html The Orange Revolution], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 28 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukraine's Supreme Court]] for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be &quot;fair and free&quot;. The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych's 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kiev, the Orange Revolution ended.

In 2010, Viktor Yanukovych was declared winner of the following  [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] said to have been conducted fairly by the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]] (CEC) and international observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/yanukovich-declared-winner-in-ukraine-poll-1899552.html |title=Yanukovich declared winner in Ukraine poll  | location=London |work=The Independent |first1=Pavel |last1=Polityuk |first2=Richard |last2=Balmforth |date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8535778.stm |title=Viktor Yanukovych sworn in as Ukraine president | work=BBC News |date=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orange ribbon.svg|thumb|80px|An [[orange ribbon]], a symbol of the Ukrainian Orange Revolution. Ribbons are common symbols of non-violent protest]]
Late 2002 [[Viktor Yushchenko]] ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]), [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] ([[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]) issued a joint statement concerning &quot;the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine&quot;. The communist stepped out of the alliance, Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential election 2004]], but the other three parties remained allies&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Tymoshenko+Moroz+Presidential+candidate+2004&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Tymoshenko%20Moroz%20Presidential%20candidate%202004&amp;f=false Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], M.E. Sharpe, 2006, ISBN 978-0-7656-1811-5, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; (until July 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5169068.stm Ukraine coalition born in chaos], [[BBC News]] (11 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Autumn of 2001 both Tymoshenko and Yushchenko had broached at creating such a coalition.&lt;ref name=CarnIP/&gt;

On 2 July 2004 Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the ''Force of the people'', a coalition which aimed to stop &quot;the destructive process that has, as a result of the [[incumbent]] authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine&quot;, at the time [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were the incumbent authorities in Ukraine. The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko won the October 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name=CarnIP&gt;[http://books.google.nl/books?id=X0PAQrsx-6YC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Force+of+the+people+Tymoshenko&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Force%20of%20the%20people&amp;f=false Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine's Democratic Breakthrough] by [[Anders Aslund]] and [[Michael A. McFaul]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], 2006, ISBN 978-0-87003-221-9&lt;/ref&gt;

This 2004 presidential election in Ukraine eventually featured two main candidates. One was sitting Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, largely supported by Leonid Kuchma (the outgoing President of Ukraine who already served two terms in the office and was precluded from running himself due to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] [[term limits]]), and the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] candidate Viktor Yushchenko, leader of the Our Ukraine faction in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] and a former Prime Minister (1999–2001).

The election was held in a highly charged atmosphere, with the Yanukovych team and the outgoing president's administration using their control of the government and state apparatus for intimidation of Yushchenko and his supporters. In September 2004, Yushchenko suffered [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] poisoning under mysterious circumstances. While he survived and returned to the campaign trail, the poisoning undermined his health and altered his appearance dramatically (his face remains disfigured by the consequences to this day).

The two main candidates were neck and neck in the first-round vote held on 31 October 2004, collecting 39.32% (Yanukovych) and 39.87% (Yushchenko) of the vote cast. The candidates that came third and fourth collected much less: [[Oleksandr Moroz]] of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] and [[Petro Symonenko]] of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] received 5.82% and 4.97%, respectively. Since no candidate carried more than 50% of the cast ballots, a [[Two-round system|run-off vote]] between two leading candidates was mandated by Ukrainian law. Later: after the run-off was announced, [[Oleksandr Moroz]] threw his support behind [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. The Progressive Socialist Party's [[Natalia Vitrenko]], who won 1.53% of the vote, endorsed Yanukovych, who hoped for Petro Simonenko's endorsement but did not receive it.&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainiустафа Найем, &quot;[http://focus.in.ua/Default.aspx?p=article&amp;id=11201 С Президентом на «вы»]&quot;, ''Фокус'', 2 April 2007, №13&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the first round of the election many complaints regarding voting irregularities in favor of the government supported Yanukovych were raised. However, as it was clear that neither nominee was close enough to collecting an outright majority in the first round, challenging the initial result would not have affected the final outcome of the election. As such the complaints were not actively pursued and both candidates concentrated on the upcoming run-off scheduled for 21 November.

[[Pora!]] activists were arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (on what was reported President Kuchma's personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.nl/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Pinchuk+Akhmetov&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=Tx-yS-DdHsnb-Qa08dy2Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Pinchuk%20Akhmetov&amp;f=false Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present] edited by Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash, [[Oxford University Press]], 2009, ISBN 978-0-19-955201-6 (page 345)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Orange (colour)|Orange]]'' was originally adopted by the Yushchenko's camp as the signifying color of his election campaign. Later the color gave name to an entire series of political terms, such as ''the Oranges'' (''Pomaranchevi'' in Ukrainian) for his political camp and supporters. At the time when the mass protests grew, and especially when they brought about political change in the country, the term ''Orange Revolution'' came to represent the entire series of events.

In view of the success of using color as a symbol to mobilize supporters, the Yanukovych camp chose [[blue]] for themselves.

==Protests==

{{History of Ukraine}}
Protests began on the eve of the second round of voting, as the official count differed markedly from [[exit poll]] results which gave Yushchenko up to an 11% lead, while official results gave the election win to Yanukovych by 3%. While Yanukovych supporters have claimed that Yushchenko's connections to the Ukrainian [[News media|media]] explain this disparity, the Yushchenko team publicized evidence of many incidents of [[electoral fraud]] in favor of the government-backed Yanukovych, witnessed by many local and foreign observers. These accusations were reinforced by similar allegations, though at a lesser scale, during the first presidential run of 31 October. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The Yushchenko campaign publicly called for protest on the dawn of election day, 21 November 2004, when allegations of fraud began to spread. Beginning on 22 November 2004, massive protests started in cities across Ukraine: the largest, in Kiev's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] ''(Independence Square)'', attracted an estimated 500,000 participants,&lt;ref name=NYT20041126&gt;Veronica Khokhlova, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482  New Kids On the Bloc], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 26 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; who on 23 November 2004, peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian parliament, many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the color of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. One of the most prominent activists of that time was [[Paraska Korolyuk]], subsequently bestowed with the [[Order of Princess Olga]].

The local councils in [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]],&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Tchorek, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article395652.ece  Protest grows in western city], ''[[The Times]]'', 26 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and several other cities passed, with the wide popular support of their constituency, a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election results, and Yushchenko took a symbolic [[Oath of office|presidential oath]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4198957.stm Yushchenko takes reins in Ukraine].  BBC NEWS. 23 January 2005. URL Retrieved 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;oath&quot; taken by Yushchenko in half-empty parliament chambers, lacking the [[quorum]] as only the Yushchenko-leaning [[Political faction|factions]] were present, could not have any legal effect. But it was an important symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the resolve of the Yushchenko campaign not to accept the compromised election results. In response, Yushchenko's opponents denounced him for taking an illegitimate oath, and even some of his moderate supporters were ambivalent about this act, while a more radical side of the Yushchenko camp demanded him to act even more decisively. Some observers argued that this symbolic presidential oath might have been useful to the Yushchenko camp should events have taken a more confrontational route.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In such a scenario, this &quot;presidential oath&quot; Yushchenko took could be used to lend legitimacy to the claim that he, rather than his rival who tried to gain the presidency through alleged fraud, was a true [[commander-in-chief]] authorized to give orders to the military and security agencies.  

At the same time, local officials in Eastern and Southern Ukraine, the stronghold of [[Viktor Yanukovych]], started a series of actions alluding to the possibility of the breakup of Ukraine or an extra-constitutional [[federalization]] of the country, should their candidate's claimed victory not be recognized. Demonstrations of public support for Yanukovych were held throughout Eastern Ukraine and some of his supporters arrived in Kiev. In Kiev the pro-Yanukovych demonstrators were far outnumbered by Yushchenko supporters, whose ranks were continuously swelled by new arrivals from many regions of Ukraine. The scale of the demonstrations in Kiev was unprecedented. By many estimates, on some days they drew up to one million people to the streets, in freezing weather.&lt;ref&gt;USAID Report [http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance/publications/pdfs/democracy_rising.pdf Democracy Rising (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protests, a man died after suffering a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name=NGFeb22008&gt;[http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/08/10.html Savik Shuster: I’m the only thing to remain after “orange revolution”], [[Novaya Gazeta]] (2 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political developments==
{{Politics of Ukraine}}
Although Yushchenko entered into negotiations with outgoing President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke up on 24 November 2004. Yanukovych was officially certified as the victor by the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]], which itself was allegedly involved in falsification of electoral results by withholding the information it was receiving from local districts and running a parallel illegal computer server to manipulate the results. The next morning after the certification took place, Yushchenko spoke to supporters in Kiev, urging them to begin a series of mass protests, general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing it to concede defeat. 

In view of the threat of illegitimate government acceding to power, Yushchenko's camp announced the creation of the ''Committee of National Salvation'' which declared a nationwide political strike.

On 1 December 2004, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] passed a resolution that strongly condemned pro-[[separatist]] and [[federalization]] actions, and passed a [[non-confidence vote]] in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], a decision Prime Minister Yanukovych refused to recognize. By the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the non-confidence vote mandated the government's resignation, but the parliament had no means to enforce a resignation without the co-operation of Prime Minister Yanukovych and outgoing President Kuchma.

On 3 December 2004, [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukraine's Supreme Court]] finally broke the political deadlock. The court decided that due to the scale of the electoral fraud it became impossible to establish the election results. Therefore, it invalidated the official results that would have given Yanukovych the presidency. As a resolution, the court ordered a revote of the run-off to be held on 26 December 2004.&lt;ref name=Supr&gt;Supreme Court of Ukraine decision regarding the annulment of 21 November vote. [http://www.skubi.net/ukraine/findings.html Full text in Ukrainian] and [http://www.skubi.net/ukraine/findings.html Summary in English]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was seen as a victory for the Yushchenko camp while Yanukovych and his supporters favored a rerun of the entire election rather than just the run-off, as a second-best option if Yanukovych was not awarded the presidency. On 8 December 2004 the parliament amended laws to provide a legal framework for the new round of elections. The parliament also approved the changes to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]], implementing a political reform backed by outgoing President Kuchma as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities and opposition.

In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the elections was &quot;taken away&quot;, he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed. &quot;I didn't want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn't want dead bodies from [[Kiev|Kyiv]] to flow down the [[Dnieper River|Dnipro]]. I didn't want to assume power through bloodshed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26340/ Yanukovych says presidential election scenario of 2004 won't be repeated in 2010], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-run election===
The 26 December revote was held under intense scrutiny of local and international observers. The preliminary results, announced by the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]] on 28 December, gave Yushchenko and Yanukovych 51.99% and 44.20% of the total vote which represented a change in the vote by +5.39% to Yushchenko and -5.27% from Yanukovych respectively when compared to the November poll.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Results of Voting in Ukraine Presidential Elections 2004&quot;, [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2004/wp0011e Central Election Commission of Ukraine]. URL Retrieved 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Yanukovych team attempted to mount a fierce legal challenge to the election results using both the Ukrainian courts and the Election Commission complaint procedures. However, all their complaints were dismissed as without merit by both the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] and the Central Election Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4061253.stm Timeline: Battle for Ukraine]&quot;.

The official ceremony took place in the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] on 23 January 2005 and was followed by the &quot;public inauguration&quot; of the newly sworn President at [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (''Independence Square'') in front of hundreds of thousands of his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Peter. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30051-2005Jan23.html In a Final Triumph, Ukrainian Sworn In]&quot;.

==Role of Ukrainian intelligence and security agencies==
According to one version of events recounted by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=NYTSBU&gt;C. J. Chivers, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0913FF395C0C748DDDA80894DD404482 BACK CHANNELS: A Crackdown Averted; How Top Spies in Ukraine Changed the Nation's Path], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian security agencies played an unusual role in the Orange Revolution, with a [[KGB]] successor agency in the former Soviet state providing qualified support to the political opposition. As per the paper report, on 28 November 2004 over 10,000 [[MVS (Ukraine)|MVS]] (Internal Ministry) troops were mobilized to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kiev by the order of their commander, Lt. Gen. [[Sergei Popkov (Military Leader)|Sergei Popkov]].  The SBU ([[Security Service of Ukraine]], a successor to the KGB in Ukraine) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksander Galaka, head of GUR (military intelligence) made calls to &quot;prevent bloodshed&quot;. Col. Gen. Ihor Smeshko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both claimed to have warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did, preventing bloodshed. 

In addition to the desire to avoid bloodshed, the ''New York Times'' article suggests that ''[[silovik]]i'', as the security officers are often called in the countries of the [[former Soviet Union]], were motivated by personal aversion to the possibility of having to serve President Yanukovych, who was in his youth convicted of robbery and assault and had alleged connection with [[political corruption|corrupt]] businessmen, especially if he were to ascend to the presidency by fraud.  The personal feelings of Gen. Smeshko towards Yanukovych may also have played a role. Additional evidence of Yushchenko's popularity and at least partial support among the SBU officers is shown by the fact that several embarrassing proofs of electoral fraud, including incriminating [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] recordings of conversations among the Yanukovych campaign and government officials discussing how to rig the election, were provided to the Yushchenko camp.&lt;ref name=wiretap&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051223004354/http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/archive/2004/november/24/4.shtml How Yanukovych Forged the Elections. Headquarters’ Telephone Talks Intercepted],  ''[[Ukrainska Pravda]]'', 24 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; These conversations were likely recorded and provided to the opposition by sympathizers in the Ukrainian Security Services.

==Involvement of outside forces==
Many analysts believe the Orange Revolution was built on a pattern first developed in the ousting of [[Slobodan Milošević]] in [[Serbia]] four years earlier, and continuing with the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Each of these victories, though apparently spontaneous, was the result of extensive grassroots campaigning and coalition-building among the opposition. Each included election victories followed up by public demonstrations, after attempts by the incumbent to hold onto power through electoral fraud.

Each of these social movements included extensive work by [[student activism|student activists]]. The most famous of these was [[Otpor]], the youth movement that helped bring in [[Vojislav Koštunica]]. In Georgia the movement was called [[Kmara]]. In Ukraine the movement has worked under the succinct slogan [[Pora]] (&quot;It's Time&quot;).  Chair of Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security [[Givi Targamadze]], former member of the Georgian [[Liberty Institute (Georgia)|Liberty Institute]], as well as some members of Kmara, were consulted by Ukrainian opposition leaders on techniques of nonviolent struggle. Georgian [[rock band]]s [[Zaza Korinteli|Zumba]], [[Soft Eject]] and Green Room, which earlier had supported the Rose Revolution, organized a solidarity concert in central Kiev to support Yushchenko’s cause in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav113004.shtml States in Caucasus, Central Asia closely monitor developments in Ukraine.] ''Eurasia Insight''. 30 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;    

Activists in each of these movements were funded and trained in tactics of political organization and [[nonviolent resistance]] by a coalition of Western pollsters and professional consultants funded by a range of Western government and non-government agencies. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', these include the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] along with the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]], the [[International Republican Institute]], the [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Freedom House]] and [[George Soros|George Soros's]] [[Open Society Institute]]. The [[National Endowment for Democracy]], a foundation supported by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], has supported non-governmental democracy-building efforts in Ukraine since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Diuk, Nadia.  &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34008-2004Dec3.html In Ukraine, Homegrown Freedom].&quot; ''Washington Post'', 4 December 2004. URL Retrieved 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Writings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent struggle]] by [[Gene Sharp]] formed the strategic basis of the student campaigns.

Former president Leonid Kravchuk accused Russian [[Business oligarch|oligarch]], [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], of financing Yushchenko's campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he said are controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yuschenko's official backers. Berezovsky has confirmed that he met Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he refused to confirm or deny that the companies that received the money were used in Yushchenko's campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/articles/2005/09/15/money/ Lenta.Ru: Пан Березовский вершит историю Украины]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[BBC]]'s ''The Russian Godfathers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_KB6mOCrSE&amp;feature=related The Russian Godfathers, episode 1 part 2] [[BBC]] Retrieved 10 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Berezovsky poured millions of dollars into sustaining the spontaneous demonstrations and was in daily contact with the key opposition leaders.

The election was marred by claims that &quot;Western PR consultants had helped orchestrate this rebellion&quot;.&lt;ref name=Betrayal&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,792458,00.html Ukraine Retreats to a Dark Past] by [[Erich Follath]], [[Der Spiegel]] (18 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[History of post-Soviet Russia|Russia's involvement in the election]] was more direct and heavily on the side of Prime Minister Yanukovych. The extent of this involvement is still contested but some facts are indisputable such as multiple meetings between [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Vladimir Putin]], Kuchma and Yanukovych before and during the elections. Putin repeatedly congratulated Yanukovych while the results were still contested, which was soon to embarrass both parties. Yanukovych received a much more preferential treatment in Russian media, and was surrounded by Russian consultants known to be close to the Kremlin throughout the election cycle. During the protests [[Russian media]] portrayed the Ukrainian protesters as irresponsible, led astray by [[Western culture|Western]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Russia/idUSTRE5390N620090410 Fearing people power, Russia slams Moldova protests], [[Reuters]] (10 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anders Åslund]] and [[Michael McFaul]] (January 2006). ''Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine's Democratic Breakthrough'', [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], ISBN 0-87003-221-6; page 159&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll held in November 2005, 54% of the Russian respondents believed the Orange Revolution was &quot;A power struggle between different groups of politicians and [[oligarchy|oligarchs]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/13923/orange_revolution_was_power_struggle_for_russians/ Orange Revolution Was Power Struggle for Russians], [[Angus Reid Global Monitor]] (27 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet usage ==
Throughout the demonstrations, [[Internet in Ukraine|Ukraine's emerging Internet]] usage (facilitated by news sites which began to disseminate the [[Kuchma tapes]]) was an integral part of the orange revolutionary process. It has even been suggested that the Orange Revolution was the first example of an Internet-organized mass protest.&lt;ref&gt;McFaul, Michael. “Transitions from Postcommunism.” Journal of Democracy 16, no. 3 (2005): pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysts believe that the Internet and mobile phones allowed an alternative media to flourish that was not subject to self-censorship or overt control by President Kuchma and his allies and pro-democracy activists (such as [[Pora!]]) were able to use mobile phones and the Internet to coordinate election monitoring and mass protests.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua.

(2008) Harnessing the Mobile Revolution. The New Policy Institute. Pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 Ukrainian constitutional changes==
As part of the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainian constitution was changed to shift powers from the presidency to the parliament. This was [[Oleksandr Moroz]]'s price for his decisive role in winning Yushchenko the presidency. The Communists also supported these measures. These came into effect in 2006 during which Yanukovych's Party of Regions won the parliamentary election, creating a coalition government with the Socialists and the Communists under his leadership. As a result, President Viktor Yushchenko had to deal with a powerful Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych who had control of many important portfolios. His premiership ended in late 2007 after Yushchenko had succeeded in his months-long attempt to dissolve parliament. After the election, Yanukovych's party again was the largest, but Tymoshenko's finished far ahead of Yushchenko's for second place. The Orange parties won a very narrow majority, permitting a new government under Tymoshenko, but Yushchenko's political decline continued to his poor showing in the 2010 presidential election.

On 1 October 2010, the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/84619/ Update: Return to 1996 Constitution strengthens president, raises legal questions], [[Kyiv Post]] (1 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 presidential election==

A Circuit administrative court in Kiev forbade mass actions at [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] from 9 January 2010 to 5 February 2010. The [[Kyiv mayor|Mayor]]`s office had requested this in order to avoid “nonstandard situations” during the aftermath of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]]. Apparently (in particular) the [[Party of Regions]], [[All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot;]] and [[All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Freedom&quot;|Svoboda]] had applied for a permit to demonstrate there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-356613.html Court forbade Maydan after first tour of election], [[UNIAN]] (13 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbent President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] got 5,5% of votes during the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vp2010/wp320pt00_t001f01=700pt001f01=700pplace=1.html  Central Election Commission Candidate Results], [[CEC Ukraine]] (19 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
“Ukraine is a European democratic country”, said Yushchenko in a sort of political will at the polling station. “It is a free nation and free people.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarussia.com/posts/755 Ukraine. Farewell to the Orange Revolution], [[EuropaRussia]] (19 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, this is one of the great achievements of the Orange Revolution.

The entire world recognized it, and international observers confirmed its results.
