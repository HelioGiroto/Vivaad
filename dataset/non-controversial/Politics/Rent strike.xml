A '''rent strike''' is a method of protest commonly employed against large [[landlord]]s. In a rent strike, a group of [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s come together and agree to refuse to pay their [[Renting|rent]] ''en masse'' until a specific list of demands is met by the landlord. This can be a useful tactic of final resort for use against intransigent landlords, but carries the obvious risk of [[eviction]] in some cases.

Historically, rent strikes have often been used in response to problems such as high rents, poor conditions in the property, or unreasonable tenancy demands; however, there have been situations where wider issues have led to such action.

Another type of [[collective action]] concerning rental property is a ''landlords' strike,'' which is undertaken by a group of landlords.  Such an action would be most likely to be undertaken when government [[tenancy]] policies (or enforcement thereof) are perceived to be patently unfair to the landlords.  The most common means of action in this case would entail the landlords collectively refusing to rent out any vacant and soon-to-be-vacated properties, in hopes of provoking a massive [[economic shortage|housing shortage]] that would quickly compel the government to change the relevant policies.

==Examples of Rent Strikes==

EUROPE

'''[[Red Clydeside#Rent strikes|Glasgow]]'''
During the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Land War]] of the 1880s and during [[World War I]] when the landlords of tenement buildings in [[Glasgow]] sought to take advantage of the influx of shipbuilders coming into the city and the absence of many local men to raise rents on the tenements' remaining residents. These women left behind were seen as an easy target and were faced with a rent increase of up to 25% and would be forcibly evicted by bailiffs if they failed to pay. As a result of this rent increase, there was a popular backlash against the landlords and a rent strike was initiated. This was led by [[Mary Barbour]], who with her &quot;army&quot; would forcibly prevent the bailiffs from entering the tenements and would pelt them with flour bombs. The strikes soon spread and became such an overwhelming success, moving out from Glasgow and on to other cities throughout the UK, that the government, on 27 November 1915, introduced legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level.

'''The Leeds rent strike in 1914''' 
In early January 1914, around 300 tenants living in the Burley area of Leeds went on rent strike against a 6d increase in rents imposed by the landlords. The rent increase had been called for by the Leeds branch of the Property Owners Association. At a mass meeting of the tenants on Sunday January 10, the rent strike organisers called for a city-wide protest against the increase. A week later, the Leeds Trades Council hosted a Labour conference intended to organise mass rent resistance. A Tenants Defence League was formed with a central committee of nine and a mission to spread the rent campaign across the city through a series of public meetings and neighbourhood canvassing.  The strike lasted eight weeks.  In the end, committee members had been evicted and blacklisted from renting any other home in the area. &lt;ref&gt;[http://freespace.virgin.net/labwise.history6/rentrick.htm The Leeds rent strike in 1914; A reappraisal of the radical history of the tenants movement, Quintin Bradley]&lt;/ref&gt;

between 5,000 and 100,000 people were out on rent strike &lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/1931-barcelona-mass-rent-strike]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Ireland'''
During &quot;[[the troubles]]&quot; (1960's-1980's) in [[Northern Ireland]], participants in the [[Civil Rights movement]] withheld rent and council rates from local councils in protest at [[internment]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sinnfein.ie/history Sinn FÃ©in - History of the Conflict]&lt;/ref&gt;

NORTH AMERICA

'''[[Anti-Rent Movement]]''' New York 1839-1850's

New York City has a long history of tenants using rent strikes to address housing conditions.  Below are 2 examples of the ways rent strikes have been used:

'''New York City Rent Strike in 1907'''
In 1907, in response to rising rents due to housing shortages 10,000 families in lower Manhattan went on rent strike.  One of the primary organizers was 16-year-old [[Pauline Newman (labor activist)|Pauline Newman]], housewives and women working in the garment industry. It lasted from December 26 until January 9 and led to about 2,000 families in having their rents reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/thisweek/dec/26/1907/pauline-newman Pauline Newman organizes influential New York rent strike]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New York City rent strike over repairs'''
In the winter of 1963-1964, a rent strike erupted in Harlem. It was led by [[Jesse Gray]], a tenant organizer there since 1953. The focus of the strike was not rent levels but poor maintenance. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenant.net/Community/history/photo15.htmlThe Tenant Movement in New York City, 1904-1984, Ronald Lawson]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2942/2901 Mandi Issacs Jackson, &quot;Harlem's Rent Strike and Rat War: Representation, Housing Access and Tenant Resistance in New York, 1958-1964,&quot; ''American Studies'', University of Kansas, v. 47, no.  1, (2006) pp. 53-79.]&lt;/ref&gt;
