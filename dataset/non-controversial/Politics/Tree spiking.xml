      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7012">'''Tree spiking''' involves hammering a metal rod, nail, or other material (commonly ceramic) into a [[tree]] trunk, strategically inserting it at the base of the trunk where a [[Lumberjack|logger]] might be expected to cut into the tree. It is an unconventional tactic, used to discourage [[logging]] by creating a [[mantrap]] which may injure or kill lumberjacks who attempt to cut down the tree or mill workers who process the wood. Furthermore, the presence of the spike reduces the commercial value of the wood, thereby reducing the economic viability of logging in the long term, while not threatening the life of the tree.{{fact|date=August 2012}}

It is believed that tree spiking originated in timber logging labor disputes in the Pacific Northwest of the [[United States]] in the late 19th century{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. It came to prominence as a contentious tactic within unconventional [[environmentalist]] circles during the 1980s, after it was advocated by [[Earth First!]] co-founder [[Dave Foreman]] in his book ''[[Ecodefense]]''. In the book, he discusses how to do it and how to avoid risks to the activist and the logger.

One injury possibly from tree spiking occurred in the United States in 1987. California mill worker George Alexander was seriously injured when the bandsaw he was operating was shattered by either an old nail or a tree spike.  This led many progressive [[Earth First!]] groups to denounce tree spiking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowell&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rowell |first1= Andrew |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Green Backlash |trans_title= |url= |format= |accessdate=2010-12-13 |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1996 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Routledge |location= |language= |isbn= 0-415-12828-5, 9780415128285 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=153 |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other activists {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} were led to either reject this form of sabotage entirely, or take some precautions, such as putting warning signs in the area where the trees are being spiked. Tree spiking is condemned by opponents as [[eco-terrorism]] as they claim it is potentially dangerous to loggers or mill-workers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/bg764.cfm Ecoterrorism: The Dangerous Fringe of the Environmental Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; although only this one injury possibly resulting from tree spiking has been widely reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowell&quot; /&gt;

==New Zealand==
[[Nothofagus|Beech]] trees that were being logged in 1998 in the [[Tuatapere]] area were spiked. Police were unable to trace those who were responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nixon&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[Pat O'Dea (New Zealand)|Pat O'Dea]], while he was the mayor for the Buller District, suggested in 2000 that [[Native Forest Action]] (NFA) had spiked trees during a direct action campaign against native forest logging on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==United States==

Following the 1987 injury of California mill worker George Alexander, tree spiking was declared a federal felony in the United States in 1988.  ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|18]] [[U.S. Code]] 1864).

In 1990, [[Earth First!]] leader [[Judi Bari]] led activists in Northern [[California]] and Southern [[Oregon]] to renounce tree-spiking as a tactic on the eve of [[Redwood Summer]], a 1990 campaign of nonviolent protests against logging of the [[Redwood Empire|redwood forest]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html Tree-spiking renunciation &amp; Mississippi summer in the California redwoods]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree spiking in fiction==
[[Derek Hansen]] in his 1998 novel ''[[Blockade (novel)|Blockade]]'' has the protagonist, a logging company operator, ordering the spiking of trees in order to discredit the anti-logging activists.

''[[Severed: Forest of the Dead]]'': Anti-logging activists sabotage a tree by spiking it, breaking the blade on a logger’s chainsaw and cutting him. The genetically enhanced tree sap mixes with the logger’s blood, starting a chain reaction of zombie mayhem.

[[Darkness Falls (The X-Files)|&quot;Darkness Falls&quot; (''The X-Files'')]]: Two environmentalist &quot;monkey wrenchers&quot; are accused of spiking trees in a Washington state forest.

[[The Anarchist Cookbook (film)|''The Anarchist Cookbook'']]:  In this film the antagonist Johnny Black plans on spiking redwood trees in an attempt to prevent logging.

The comic series ''Concrete,'' by [[Paul Chadwick]], dedicated a multi-part story called &quot;Think Like a Mountain&quot; to the subject of tree spiking.

A group of radical environmentalists engage in tree-spiking in the novel [[Hayduke Lives|''Hayduke Lives!'']] by [[Edward Abbey]].

In the young adult novel &quot;Spirit of the Rainforest&quot; by [[Eric Wilson (author)|Eric Wilson]], young protagonist Tom Austen takes part in a protest against logging a rainforest but the protest is broken when a more radical character spikes a tree, angering non violent protesters.

In the 1991 ''[[L. A. Law]]'' episode &quot;Do the Spike Thing&quot;, a mill worker sues a logging company and a radical environmentalist group when he is injured by a saw blade that breaks upon striking a spike.
