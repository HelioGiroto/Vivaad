'''Fortney Hillman &quot;Pete&quot; Stark, Jr.''' (born November 11, 1931) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|13}}, serving since 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;The San Francisco Gate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lochhead|first=Carolyn|title=The San Francisco Gate -   Pete Stark's burned bridges have cost him|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Pete-Stark-s-burned-bridges-have-cost-him-3794872.php|work=The San Francisco Gate|publisher=The San Francisco Gate|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He is the 5th [[List of United States Representatives in the 112th Congress by seniority|most senior Representative]], as well as 6th most senior member of Congress overall.  He is also the dean of California's 55-member Congressional delegation.  His district lies in southwestern [[Alameda County]] and includes [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Union City, California|Union City]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[San Leandro]], [[San Lorenzo]], and [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], as well as parts of [[Oakland]] and [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep. Pete Stark, D-Md.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/23/EDQG16LHLD.DTL|accessdate=2 July 2010|newspaper=San Francisco Gate|date=2009-03-24|page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his service to the 13th district, Stark had also represented the [[California's 8th congressional district|8th]] and [[California's 9th congressional district|9th]] congressional districts in California. After 2010 redistricting, Stark campaigned for the [[California's 15th congressional district|15th district seat]] in 2012, and lost to fellow Democrat [[Eric Swalwell]].

==Early life, education, and banking career==
Stark was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in general [[engineering]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/1990/nov14/23833.html MIT 'Loses' One Seat in US Congress] November 14, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1955 to 1957. After leaving the Air Force, Stark attended the [[Haas School of Business]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and received his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in 1960. Stark originally lived in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], but ultimately relocated to Maryland. He primarily resides in his Maryland home with his family but still maintains a residence in the California district he represents, although he only visits his constituents twice per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep. Pete Stark, D-Md.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/23/EDQG16LHLD.DTL|accessdate=2 July 2010|newspaper=San Francisco Gate|date=2009-03-24|page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Stark founded Security National Bank, a small bank in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]]. Within 10 years it grew to a $100 million company with branches across the East Bay.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1972, Stark moved to Oakland to run in the Democratic [[Primary election|primary]] against 14-term incumbent U.S. Representative [[George Paul Miller]] in what was then the [[California's 8th congressional district|8th district]]. Stark then 41, a sharp critic of the octogenarian, Miller.
He stated, &quot;Miller entered the House in 1945...28 years ago.&quot; He won the Democratic primary with 56% of the vote, a 34-point margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=236037&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States House elections, 1972|1972 general election]], he defeated Republican Lew Warden with 53% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage of his career. He has since been re-elected 18 times, and has only dropped below 60 percent of the vote twice (1980 and 1990). In 1980, he won with just 54%, and in 1990 he won with 58% of the vote. Due to [[redistricting]], his district has changed numbers twice, from the 8th (1973–75) to the [[California's 9th congressional district|9th]] (1975–93) to the 13th (since 1993). 

He was unopposed for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 election and was re-elected in the general election with 76.3% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/1359.htm &quot;U.S. Congress - District 13 Districtwide Results&quot;], California Secretary of State website . Retrieved November 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012 elections]], due to California's [[nonpartisan blanket primary]], his opponent in the general election was a fellow Democrat, [[Eric Swalwell]]. Swalwell defeated Stark in the race to represent [[California's 15th congressional district]], to which Stark was redistricted from the [[California's 13th congressional district|13th district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Richard|title=Pete Stark, veteran Calif. congressman, defeated by 31-year-old|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/11/pete-stark-defeated.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
At 39 years, Stark was the longest-serving [[member of Congress]] from California. 

;Fiscal policy
Stark voted against the bipartisan [[2007 U.S. Farm Bill|May 2008 farm subsidy bill]], which was supported by most House Democrats and over half of House Republicans, in part because of its cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll315.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123751291083991301.html|title=Congress's Own Liechtenstein|publisher=Online.wsj.com|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also voted against both readings of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which gave $700 billion dollars to troubled investment banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll674.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll681.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Stark argued that &quot;the proposed bailout will only help reckless speculators who have been caught on the wrong side of the come line.&quot; Criticizing the bill as [[corporate welfare]], he said &quot;The bill before us today is basically the same three-page Wall Street give-away first put forth by President Bush&quot; before the vote on the first bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoller |first=Matt |url=http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=8516 |title=Opening the Day: Democrat Pete Stark Goes After Paulson's &quot;irresponsible rumor mongering hogwash&quot; |publisher=Open Left |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sun |first=Alameda |url=http://alamedasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3960&amp;Itemid=11 |title=Stark's Vote Helps Quash Bailout |publisher=Alameda Sun |date=2008-10-02 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2008, Stark and [[Peter DeFazio]] signed a letter to House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] proposing a one quarter of one percent “transaction tax” on all trades in financial instruments including stocks, options, and futures. On September 29, 2008, Stark voted against HR 3997, the bailout bill backed by President Bush, House Speaker Pelosi and presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, and the bill subsequently failed to pass.  Explaining his vote, Stark stated, &quot;President Bush tells us that we face unparalleled financial doom if this $700 billion bailout is not approved today. He and his Treasury Secretary—a former Wall Street fat cat—tell us that we have reached the point of 'crisis.' That is a familiar line from this President. It sounds like the disastrous rush to war in Iraq and the subsequent stampede to enact the Patriot Act. As I opposed the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, I stand in opposition to his latest rush to judgment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090301135247/http://www.house.gov/stark/news/110th/pressreleases/2008-09/29-bailout.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2008, Stark voted against HR 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.  With this vote, Stark became the sole member of the House of Representatives from the San Francisco Bay Area to oppose the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;abclocal.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=6431352 |title=A look at how Bay Area lawmakers voted on the bailout &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Explaining his vote, Stark stated, &quot;You're getting the same kind of misinformation now, the same kind of rush to judgment to tell you that a crisis will occur. It won't. Vote 'no.' Come back and help work on a bill that will help all Americans.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;abclocal.go.com&quot;/&gt;

;Health care
Stark is known to have a longstanding interest in health care issues and was critical of the fate of the uninsured under the [[George W. Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benjamin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Benjamin| coauthor=Kerry Young|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/38815?page_no=2|title=46 Million Live in U.S. Without Health Insurance|work=[[New York Sun]]|page=2|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 
[[John Conyers]], in April 2006, Stark brought an action against President Bush and others alleging violations of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in the passing of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]], which cut [[Medicaid]] payments.&lt;ref name=&quot;usat-11sue&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-28-budget-lawsuit_x.htm| title=11 House Members to Sue Over Budget Bill| work = USA Today|agency = Associated Press|date=April 28, 2006|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, ''[[Conyers v. Bush]]'', was ultimately dismissed for [[Standing (law)|lack of standing]] in November of the same year.

;Iraq War
[[File:Stark 02.JPG|thumb|right|200 px|Pete Stark speaks at a Town Hall meeting in January 2007 in [[San Leandro, California.]]]] 
Stark was an early opponent of the [[Iraq War]], [[s:Pete Stark's Iraq Speech|speaking on the floor]] against the resolution authorizing military force against Iraq, on October 10, 2002. In part he said, &quot;Well then, who will pay? School kids will pay. There'll be no money to keep them from being left behind—way behind. Seniors will pay. They'll pay big time as the Republicans privatize Social Security and rob the Trust Fund to pay for the capricious war. Medicare will be curtailed and drugs will be more unaffordable. And there won't be any money for a drug benefit because Bush will spend it all on the war. Working folks will pay through loss of job security and bargaining rights. Our grandchildren will pay through the degradation of our air and water quality. And the entire nation will pay as Bush continues to destroy civil rights, women's rights and religious freedom in a rush to phony patriotism and to courting the messianic Pharisees of the religious right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/10/us/threats-responses-excerpts-house-debate-use-military-force-against-iraq.html?pagewanted=1 &quot;Excerpts From House Debate on the Use of Military Force Against Iraq&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 2002, p. A21&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003 Stark supported a reinstatement of the draft, partly in protest against the call to war but also saying, &quot;If we're going to have these escapades, we should not do it on the backs of poor people and minorities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0123-04.htm|title=Stark Joins Call to Restore Draft|work=[[Common Dreams NewsCenter]]|date=January 23, 2003|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;In October 2004, he was one of only two members of Congress to vote in favor of the [[Universal National Service Act]] of 2003 (HR 163), a bill proposing resumption of the military draft.&lt;ref&gt; http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2004/roll494.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

He has not voted for any bills to continue funding the Iraq war, but has voted 'present' for some. In a statement posted on his website he explained, &quot;Despite my utmost respect for my colleagues who crafted this bill, I can't in good conscience vote to continue this war. Nor, however, can I vote 'No' and join those who think today's legislation goes too far toward withdrawal. That's why I'm making the difficult decision to vote 'present'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GovTrack-2007-03-23&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=March 23, 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=110-h20070323-19#sMonofilemx003Ammx002Fmmx002Fmmx002Fmhomemx002Fmgovtrackmx002Fmdatamx002Fmusmx002Fm110mx002Fmcrmx002Fmh20070323-19.xmlElementm164m0m0m|title=Congressional Record: U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, 2007|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;Stark was the only member of Congress to take this position. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

On September 20, 2007, Stark reaffirmed that he is an [[atheist]] by making a public announcement in front of the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, the Harvard Law School Heathen Society, and various other atheist, [[agnostic]], [[secular]], [[humanism|humanist]], and [[nontheism|nonreligious]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Amanda| last=Phillips|url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2007/09/27/News/U.s-Rep.Pete.Stark.comes.Out.As.An.Atheist-3000553.shtml?reffeature=mostemailedtab|title=U.S. Rep.

On February 9, 2011, Stark introduced a bill to Congress designating February 12, 2011 as [[Darwin Day]] as a culmination of collaboration between Rep. Stark and the American Humanist Association. The resolution states, “[[Charles Darwin]] is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement… and around which to build a global celebration of science and humanity.” {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Controversies==
===Controversial statements===
In August 1990, Stark drew controversy for calling [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Secretary]] [[Louis Wade Sullivan]], an [[African American]], &quot;a disgrace to his race&quot; for supporting Bush Administration policies that Stark called &quot;bankrupt and damaging to minority members.&quot; Stark was criticizing Sullivan's opposition to proposals for federally sponsored [[national health insurance]] when Stark had introduced legislation for national health insurance at the time, and said that Sullivan had been influenced by George H. W. Bush administration officials such as [[Office of Management and Budget]] Director [[Richard Darman]] and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[John H. Sununu]] to change his positions on both [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] and [[Health care in the United States|health care]]. Sullivan angrily retorted, &quot;I don't live on Pete Stark's plantation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/03/us/lawmaker-assails-health-chief.html Lawmaker Assails Health Chief] 3 August 1990. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and replied in a statement, saying in part, &quot;I guess I should feel ashamed because Congressman Stark thinks I am not a 'good Negro.' As a Cabinet member who has spent almost four decades of my life dedicated to healing,...[I] am unable to express my own views without being subject to race-based criticism by those who are not ready to accept independent thinking by a black man.&quot; Stark later apologized for the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DE1E3DF937A3575BC0A966958260 Lawmaker Says His Racial Insult of Health Secretary Was Mistake] 4 August 1990. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, Stark responded to a constituent [[Army National Guard]] member's letter critical of Stark's recent vote on the [[war in Iraq]] by immediately calling the service member's telephone and leaving a feisty response on voicemail which was later broadcast on several San Francisco radio stations. Stark's harsh voicemail was transcribed as follows:

{{cquote|Dan, this is Congressman Pete Stark, and I just got your fax. And you don't know what you're talking about. So if you care about enlisted people, you wouldn't have voted for that thing either. But probably somebody put you up to this, and I'm not sure who it was, but I doubt if you could spell half the words in the letter, and somebody wrote it for you. So I don't pay much attention to it. But I'll call you back later and let you tell me more about why you think you're such a great goddamn hero and why you think that this generals [sic] and the Defense Department, who forced these poor enlisted guys to do what they did, shouldn't be held to account. That's the issue. So if you want to stick it to a bunch of enlisted guys, have your way. But if you want to get to the bottom of people who forced this awful program in Iraq, then you should understand more about it than you obviously do. Thanks.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110005061 Stark Raving Mad] May 10, 2004. Wall Street Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djeGqNVXjZE Fox News Report on YouTube] May 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On October 18, 2007, Stark made the following comments on the House floor during a debate with Congressman [[Joe Barton]] of [[Texas]]: &quot;Republicans sure don't care about finding $200 billion to fight the illegal war in Iraq. Where are you going to get that money? Are you going to tell us lies like you're telling us today? Is that how you're going to fund the war? You don't have money to fund the war or children. But you're going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to Iraq to get their heads blown off for the President's amusement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGaNR9dVPM YouTube video], October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The John Ziegler Show'', [[KFI]], October 18, 2007 (7PM hour) and October 19, 2007 (7PM hour) ([http://www.kfi640.com/podcast/JohnZiegler.xml podcast]. Retrieved October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the initial criticism to his statements, when asked by a radio station if he would take back any of his statements, Stark responded &quot;Absolutely not. I may have dishonored the Commander-in-Chief, but I think he’s done pretty well to dishonor himself without any help from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''KCBS'', &quot;[http://www.kcbs.com/pages/1107651.php? Stark Stands Behind GOP Accusations]&quot;, October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, his office also issued a press release, saying in part, &quot;I have nothing but respect for our brave men and women in uniform and wish them the very best. But I respect neither the Commander-in-Chief who keeps them in harms [sic] way nor the [[Chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawk]]s in Congress who vote to deny children health care.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stark.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=687&amp;Itemid=66 Stark Calls On Boehner, Republicans To Retract Opposition To Children's Health Care, Apologize] Press Release, Office of Congressman Pete Stark&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later on October 23, after the House voted down a [[Censure in the United States|censure]] resolution against Stark sponsored by [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] [[John Boehner]], he said, &quot;I apologize for this reason: I think we have serious issues before us, the issue of providing medical care to children, the issue about what we’re going to do about a war that we’re divided about how to end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/stark/news/110th/pressreleases/2007-10/23-apologize.htm Stark apologizes, calls on Congress to provide health care to children and end the war in Iraq], October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other controversies include singling out &quot;[[Jewish]] colleagues&quot; for blame for the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and referring to Congressman [[Stephen Solarz]] of [[New York]] (who co-sponsored the Gulf War Authorization Act) as &quot;Field Marshal Solarz in the pro-[[Israel]] forces.&quot; in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Stark's Latest Gaffe Is Just One In a Long Line|first=Jonathan| last = Weisman | publisher=Washington Post | date = 24 October 2007 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/23/AR2007102302165.html|accessdate =2009-04-15 | pages = A17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, during a private meeting with Congresswoman [[Nancy Johnson]] of [[Connecticut]], he called Johnson a &quot;whore for the insurance industry&quot; and suggested that her knowledge of health care came solely from &quot;[[pillow talk]]&quot; with her husband, a physician. His press secretary, Caleb Marshall, defended him in saying, &quot;He didn't call her a 'whore,' he called her a 'whore of the insurance industry.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;/&gt; In a 2001 [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health]] hearing on [[abstinence]] promotion, he referred to Congressman [[J. C. Watts]] of [[Oklahoma]] as &quot;the current [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Conference Chairman]], whose children were all born out of wedlock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;/&gt; In 2003, when Stark was told to &quot;shut up&quot; by Congressman [[Scott McInnis]] of [[Colorado]] during a [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] meeting due to Stark's belittling of the chairman, [[Bill Thomas]] of [[California]], he replied, &quot;You think you are big enough to make me, you little wimp? Come on. Come over here and make me, I dare you. You little fruitcake.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp&quot;/&gt;

In an older video taped interview with [[Jan Helfeld]] concerning the size of the national debt, Stark stated that the size of the national debt is a reflection of the nation's wealth. When pressed if the nation should take on more debt in order to have more wealth, Stark threatened Helfeld and said, “You get the fuck out of here or I’ll throw you out the window.”&lt;ref&gt;[Pete Stark inside Jan Helfeld, “Pete Stark Blows Up Over National Debt,” YouTube, Posted August 23, 2008; Online at www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjbPZAMked0.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2009, Stark suggested that his moderate Democratic colleagues were &quot;[[brain dead]]&quot; for proposing changes to the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009|health care reform bill]] being considered by Congress. Saying that they &quot;just want to cause trouble,&quot; Stark claimed, &quot;they're for the most part, I hate to say, brain dead, but they're just looking to raise money from insurance companies and promote a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] agenda that is not really very useful in this whole process&quot; during a conference call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=AP&amp;date=20090827&amp;id=10304842 |title=Page Unavailable - MSN Money |publisher=News.moneycentral.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' editorialized on Stark, &quot;Only a politician who assumes he has a job for life could behave so badly on a semi-regular basis by spewing personalized invective that might get him punched in certain East Bay taverns. Would-be challengers sometimes sense a whiff of opportunity, but the reality of taking on a 16-term Democrat in solidly liberal terrain is nothing short of daunting. Surely there must be someone along the shoreline between Alameda and Fremont who could represent the good citizens of the district with class and dignity. It's not the case now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfc01&quot;&gt;''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/07/23/ED251350.DTL Pete Stark's tiring tirades]'', [[San Francisco Chronicle]], July 23, 2003 . Retrieved April 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a town hall meeting in 2009, a constituent who opposed President Barack Obama's health care plan told Stark, &quot;Mr. Congressman, don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.&quot; Stark responded with, &quot;I wouldn't dignify you by peeing on your leg. It wouldn't be worth wasting the urine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?blogid=14&amp;entry_id=47602#ixzz0RFamWaIl | title=SFGate: Politics Blog : Rep.

===Real estate taxes===
For two years, Stark was allegedly claiming his waterfront Maryland home as his primary residence in order to claim a homestead exemption to reduce his local real estate taxes. Under Maryland law, in order to qualify, the owner must register to vote and drive in Maryland—Stark uses a California address for those purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/maryland_is_home_sweet_home_for_congressmen_seeking_tax_break/ |title=Maryland Is Home Sweet Home for Congressmen Seeking Tax Break|publisher=ABA Journal|date=2009-03-19|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2008, the [[House Ethics Committee]] began an investigation in regard to Stark using his Maryland residence as his primary residence while claiming to live in San Lorenzo. The home Stark claims as his residence and where he is registered to vote is owned and occupied by his in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted: 6:23 pm PST January 18, 2010|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/22268794/detail.html|title=Local Congressman To Learn Results Of Ethics Probe|publisher=Ktvu.com|date=2010-01-18|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the House Ethics Committee voted unanimously that the allegations that Stark took a tax break on a property he owns in Maryland were unfounded.
