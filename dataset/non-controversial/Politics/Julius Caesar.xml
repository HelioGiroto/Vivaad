The day is sometimes stated to be 12&amp;nbsp;July when his feast-day was celebrated after deification, but this was because his true birthday clashed with the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]''. Some scholars, based on the dates he held certain magistracies, have made a case for 101 or 102&amp;nbsp;BC as the year of his birth, but scholarly consensus favors 100&amp;nbsp;BC.

See Blackburn, B and Holford-Strevens, L. (1999 corrected 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year''. Oxford University Press. p. 671. ISBN 978-0-19-214231-3&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman general]] and [[Politician|statesman]] and a distinguished writer of [[Latin]] prose. He played a critical role in the gradual transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]].

In 60 BC, Caesar, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] and [[Pompey]]  formed a [[First Triumvirate|political alliance]] that was to dominate [[Roman politics]] for several years. Their attempts to amass power through [[populares|populist]] tactics were opposed by the [[optimates|conservative elite]] within the [[Roman Senate]], among them [[Cato the Younger]] with the frequent support of [[Cicero]]. Caesar's [[conquest of Gaul]], completed by 51&amp;nbsp;BC, extended Rome's territory to the [[English Channel]] and the [[Rhine]]. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge across the Rhine]]  and conducted the first [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasion of Britain]]. 

These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the [[Battle of Carrhae|death of Crassus]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused, and marked his defiance in 49&amp;nbsp;BC by crossing the [[Rubicon]] with a [[Roman legion|legion]] to march on Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keppie|first=Lawrence|title=The making of the Roman Army: from Republic to Empire|year=1998|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-3014-9|page=102|chapter=The approach of civil war}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesar's civil war|Civil war]] resulted, from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of Rome.

After assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the [[Julian calendar]]. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed &quot;[[Roman dictator|dictator]] in perpetuity&quot;. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the [[Ides of March]] (15&amp;nbsp;March) 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]. A new series of [[Roman civil war|civil wars]] broke out, and the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitutional government of the Republic]] was never restored. Caesar's adopted heir, later known as [[Augustus]], rose to sole power, and the era of the [[Roman Empire]] began.

Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of [[Sallust]]. The later biographies of Caesar by [[Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]] are also major sources.

==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Julius Caesar}}

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]]]
Caesar was born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, the ''[[gens]] [[Julia (gens)|Julia]]'', which claimed descent from [[Ascanius|Iulus]], son of the legendary [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], supposedly the son of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Froude|first=James Anthony|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Life of Caesar|publisher=Project Gutenberg e-text|year=1879|page=67|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt}} See also: [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6 6]; [[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[cognomen]]'' &quot;Caesar&quot; originated, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], with an ancestor who was born by [[caesarean section]] (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7]. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''[[Suda]]'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]). Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], lived long after he was born.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' suggests three [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar|alternative explanations]]: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin ''caesaries''); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin ''oculis caesiis''); or that he killed an elephant (''caesai'' in Moorish) in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Aelius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aelius*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name. Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential. Caesar's father, also called [[Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul of Asia, 90s BC)|Gaius Julius Caesar]], governed the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', 13.3.51–52&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother, [[Aurelia Cotta]], came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutsuet1&quot;&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Caesar's formative years were a time of turmoil and &quot;savage bloodshed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 60&lt;/ref&gt;  There were several wars from 91 BC to 82 BC, although from 82 BC to 80 BC, the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was purging Rome of his political enemies. Domestically, Roman politics was bitterly divided. In 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]&lt;/ref&gt; so at sixteen Caesar was the head of the family. The following year he was nominated to be the new high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#22 2.22]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the holder of that position not only had to be a patrician but also be married to a patrician, he broke off his engagement to a [[Plebs|plebeian]] girl he had been betrothed to since boyhood, and married [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Lucius Cinna]]'s daughter [[Cornelia Cinna minor|Cornelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|title= Julius Caesar |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, having brought [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] to terms, Sulla returned to Rome and had himself appointed to the revived office of [[Roman dictator|dictator]].&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#76 1.76–102]; Plutarch, ''Sulla'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html#24 24–33]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#23 2.23–28]; Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans5.html 5]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaius Marius, Caesar's uncle]]
Sulla's [[proscription]]s saw hundreds of his political enemies killed or exiled. Caesar, as the nephew of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and son-in-law of Cinna, was targeted. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the [[Vestal Virgins]]. Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutsuet1&quot; /&gt;

Caesar left Rome and joined the army, where he won the [[Civic Crown]] for his part in an important siege. On a mission to [[Bithynia]] to secure the assistance of King [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes's]] fleet, he spent so long at his court that rumors of an affair with the king arose, which Caesar would vehemently deny for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#2 2–3]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#2 2–3]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hearing of Sulla's death in 78 BC, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. Lacking means since his inheritance was confiscated, he acquired a modest house in a lower-class neighborhood of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;suet46&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#46 46]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he turned to legal advocacy. He became known for his exceptional oratory, accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for [[extortion]] and corruption.

On the way across the [[Aegean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4]). Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1.8 1.8–2]) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41.3 2:41.3–42]) says merely that it happened when he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was kidnapped by [[piracy|pirates]] and held prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 Plutarch, ''Caesar'']&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty [[talent (weight)|talents]] of silver, he insisted they ask for fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julius Caesar: Conqueror and Dictator |author=Thorne, James |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 39&lt;/ref&gt;  After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them. He had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 40&lt;/ref&gt;—a promise the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] to repel an incursion from the east.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Rome, he was elected military [[tribune]], a first step in a political career. He was elected [[quaestor]] for 69 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 51&lt;/ref&gt; and during that year he delivered the [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|funeral oration for his aunt Julia]]. His wife, Cornelia, also died that year.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 52&lt;/ref&gt; After her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC, Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in [[Hispania|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 100&lt;/ref&gt; While there he is said to have encountered a statue of [[Alexander the Great]], and realized with dissatisfaction he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 101&lt;/ref&gt; he married [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#5 5–8]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#5 5]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 63 BC, he ran for election to the post of [[Pontifex Maximus]], chief priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two powerful senators. There were accusations of bribery by all sides. Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#7 7]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Cicero]], who was consul that year, exposed [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to seize control of the republic, several senators accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sallust]], ''Catiline War'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his praetorship, Caesar was appointed to govern [[Hispania Ulterior|Spain]], but he was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of Rome's richest men. In return for political support in his opposition to the interests of [[Pompey]], Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus be open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Spain, he conquered two local tribes and was hailed as ''[[imperator]]'' by his troops, reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#11 11–12]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18 18.1]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As ''imperator'', Caesar was entitled to a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand ''in absentia'', but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18.2 18.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consulship and military campaigns==
{{Main|Military campaigns of Julius Caesar|First Triumvirate}}
In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59&amp;nbsp;BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid – even [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favor of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Marcus Bibulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13–14]; Suetonius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was already in [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]' political debt, but he also made overtures to [[Pompey]]. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the [[First Triumvirate]] (&quot;rule of three men&quot;), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.1|2.1]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.3|2.3]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44 2.44]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13–14], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 47], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 14]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#54 37.54–58]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar also married again, this time [[Calpurnia Pisonis|Calpurnia]], who was the daughter of another powerful senator.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar proposed a law for the redistribution of public lands to the poor, a proposal supported by Pompey, by force of arms if need be, and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavorable and thus void the new law, but was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His [[lictor|bodyguards]] had their [[fasces|ceremonial axes]] broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts to obstruct Caesar's legislation proved ineffective. [[Roman satirists]] ever after referred to the year as &quot;the consulship of Julius and Caesar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.16|2.16]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.18|2.18]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.19|2.19]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.20|2.20]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.21|2.21]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14 14], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 47–48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#32 32–33]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#1 38.1–8]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the [[proconsul|governorship]] of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy) and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] (southeastern Europe), with [[Transalpine Gaul]] (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 2:44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14.10 14.10], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14.3 14.3], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#48 48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#33.3 33.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#22 22]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#8.5 38:8.5]&lt;/ref&gt; When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of Gaul===
{{Main|Gallic Wars}}
Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero's speeches [[s:Against Verres|against Verres]] for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense.&lt;/ref&gt; or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of [[Gaul]] were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], with the help of a contingent of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.19|1.19]]; Julius Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Commentaries on the Gallic War]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 1|Book 1]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 3]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#31 38.31–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north (directly opposite [[Roman Britain|Britain]]).&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2|Book 2]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#1 39.1–5]&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring of 56&amp;nbsp;BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The [[Lucca Conference]] renewed the [[First Triumvirate]] and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Q.+fr.+2.3 2.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#24 24]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#21 21], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 14–15], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#51 51]&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 3|Book 3]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#40 39.40–46]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.

[[File:RomanRepublic40BC.jpg|thumb|350px|The extent of the Roman Republic in 40 BC after Caesar's conquests.]]
In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year possibly the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the British Isles |author=Black, Jeremy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2003 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4|Book 4]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#47 47–53]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to friends'' [[s:Letters to friends/7.6|7.6]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.7|7.7]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.8|7.8]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.10|7.10]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.17|7.17]]; ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.13|2.13]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/3.1|3.1]]; ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.15|4.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.17|4.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.18|4.18]]; Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5|Book 5–6]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/40*.html#1 40.1–11]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed [[invasion]] of the east. Rome was on the edge of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#26]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#23.5 23.5], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#53 53–55], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#16 16–33]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#46 46–47]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 52 BC another, larger revolt erupted in Gaul, led by [[Vercingetorix]]. Vercingetorix managed to unite the Gallic tribes and proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the [[Battle of Alesia]] finally forced his surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 7|Book 7]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/40*.html#33 40.33–42]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite scattered outbreaks of [[List of Roman battles|warfare]] the following year,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Hirtius]], ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 8|Book 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that the army had fought against three million men during the [[Gallic Wars]], of whom one&amp;nbsp;million died, and another million were [[History of slavery|enslaved]]. The Romans subjugated 300 tribes and destroyed 800 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/lives/chapter48.html|title=Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans, by Plutarch (chapter48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in view of the difficulty in finding accurate counts in the first place, Caesar's propagandistic purposes, and the common exaggeration of numbers in ancient texts, the stated totals of enemy combatants are likely to be too high.

===Civil war===
{{Main|Caesar's Civil War}}

In 50 BC, the [[Roman senate|Senate]], led by [[Pompey]], ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished.&lt;ref name=Sue28&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#28 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. In January 49&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar crossed the [[Rubicon]] river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only [[Legio XIII Gemina|one legion]] and ignited [[Caesar's civil war|civil war]]. Upon [[crossing the Rubicon]], Caesar, according to [[Plutarch]] and [[Suetonius]], is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright [[Menander]], in Greek, &quot;[[alea iacta est|the die is cast]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Plu65&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#32.8 32.8]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Erasmus]], however, notes that the more accurate translation of the Greek [[imperative mood]] would be &quot;alea icta esto&quot; ''let'' the die be cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrijhoffSperna Weiland1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=D. F. S.|last2=Sperna Weiland|first2=Jan|editor=Weiland, J. S.|title=Erasmus of Rotterdam: the man and the scholar|year=1988|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=90-04-08920-9|page=161|chapter=Erasmus and textual scholarship: Suetonius}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey and much of the Senate fled to the south, having little confidence in his newly raised troops. Despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey did not intend to fight. Caesar pursued Pompey, hoping to capture him before his legions could escape.&lt;ref name=Plu35&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him. Caesar decided to head for Spain, while leaving Italy under the control of [[Mark Antony]]. Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to [[Hispania|Spain]], where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Greece where in July 48 BC at [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. He decisively defeated Pompey at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] in an exceedingly short engagement later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#42 42–45]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kleopatra-VII.-Altes-Museum-Berlin1.jpg|thumb|A bust of [[Cleopatra&amp;nbsp;VII]].]]
In Rome, Caesar was appointed [[Roman dictator|dictator]],&lt;ref name=Plu37&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#37 37.2]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Mark Antony]] as his [[Master of the Horse]] (second in command); Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then, after eleven days, resigned this dictatorship.&lt;ref name=Plu37/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictator&quot;&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dicators Caesar'', Köln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt, where Pompey was soon murdered.&lt;ref name=PluPom77&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#77 77–79]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Caesar then became involved with an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]]. Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra; he is reported to have wept at the sight of Pompey's head,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#80 80.5]&lt;/ref&gt; which was offered to him by the pharaoh as a gift. In any event, Caesar withstood the [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|Siege of Alexandria]] and later he defeated the pharaoh's forces at the [[Battle of the Nile (47 BC)|Battle of the Nile]] in 47&amp;nbsp;BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphal procession on the [[Nile River|Nile]] in the spring of 47&amp;nbsp;BC. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, and Caesar was introduced to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salisbury 2001 52&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Salisbury|first=Joyce E|title=Women in the ancient world|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=1-57607-092-1|page=52|chapter=Cleopatra VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar and Cleopatra never married, as Roman law recognized marriages only between two Roman citizens. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage, which lasted fourteen years – in Roman eyes, this did not constitute adultery – and may have fathered a son called [[Caesarion]]. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salisbury 2001 52&quot;/&gt;

Late in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], with a term of one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictator&quot;/&gt; After spending the first months of 47&amp;nbsp;BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated the king of [[Pontus]]; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited from  27 to 29 May 47 BC, ( 25–27 May&lt;sup&gt;[[Gregorian calendar|greg.]]&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to [[Cicero]], [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] was planning to kill him at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar: a history of the art of war among the Romans down to the end of the Roman empire, with a detailed account of the campaigns of Caius Julius Caesar, page 791, Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Greenhill Books, 1995. ISBN 9781853672163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul: The Man and the Myth, page 15, Studies on personalities of the New Testament Personalities of the New Testament Series, Calvin J. Roetzel, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999. ISBN 9780567086983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, page 311, Philip Freeman, Simon and Schuster, 2008. ISBN 9780743289535&lt;/ref&gt; Thence, he proceeded to Africa to deal with the remnants of Pompey's senatorial supporters. He quickly gained a significant victory in 46&amp;nbsp;BC over Cato, who then committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#52 52–54]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After this victory, he was appointed Dictator for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dicators Caesar'', Köln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38. Technically, Caesar was not appointed Dictator with a term of ten years but he was appointed annual dictator for the next ten years in advance.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the [[Battle of Munda]] in March 45&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46&amp;nbsp;BC and 45&amp;nbsp;BC (this last time without a colleague).

==Dictatorship and assassination==
While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honors on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honor Caesar’s victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56.7–56.8]&lt;/ref&gt; On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] (Octavian) as the heir to everything, including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] would be the next heir in succession.

During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of [[imperialism]], the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiraled out of control, and the ''status quo'' had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Between his crossing of the [[Rubicon|Rubicon River]] in 49 BC, and his [[Ides of March|assassination]] in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 133&quot;&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt; First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 133&quot; /&gt; 

The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 133&quot; /&gt; To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot;&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; and so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Dictatorship===
When Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him [[Roman triumph|triumphs]] for his victories, ostensibly over Gaul, Egypt, [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces]] and [[Juba I of Numidia|Juba]], rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way. When [[Arsinoe IV]], Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 43.19.2–3; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 2.101.420&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludi|Triumphal games]] were held, with [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] involving 400 lions, and [[Gladiator|gladiator contests]]. A [[Naumachia|naval battle]] was held on a flooded basin at the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;J.F.C. Fuller, ''Julius Caesar, Man, Soldier, Tyrant&quot;, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Circus Maximus]], two armies of war captives, each of 2,000 people, 200 horse and 20 elephants, fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and only stopped when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

After the triumph, Caesar set forth to passing an unprecedented legislative agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the grain dole, and that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of [[Italy]]. Then he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Forum of Caesar]], with its [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], was then built, among many other public works. Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History | author=Mackay, Christopher S. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2004 | page = 254}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 47 to 44&amp;nbsp;BC he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Roman Army, 31 BC–AD 337 | author=Campbell, J. B. | publisher=Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most important change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The calendar at the time was regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had resulted in a great deal of disorder. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary/leap day]] at the end of February every fourth year.&lt;ref name=Sue40&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#40 40]&lt;/ref&gt;  

To bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46&amp;nbsp;BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the [[Julian calendar]] opened on 1 January 45 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue40&quot;/&gt; This calendar is almost identical to [[Gregorian calendar|the current Western calendar]].

Shortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of [[Carthage]] and [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]]. He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries. His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theater, and a library on the scale of the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 

He also wanted to convert [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] to a major port, and cut a canal through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. Militarily, he wanted to conquer the [[Dacia]]ns, [[Parthia]]ns, and avenge the loss at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]]. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilization. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of [[Quintilis]] was renamed July in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

He was granted further honors, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch; coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings. He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semi-official or popular [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with [[Mark Antony]] as his high priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

====Political reforms====
{{Main|Constitutional Reforms of Julius Caesar}}
The history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain. Caesar held both the [[Roman Dictator|dictatorship]] and the [[Tribune|tribunate]], but alternated between the [[Roman Consul|consulship]] and the [[Proconsul]]ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot; /&gt; His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot; /&gt; He was first appointed dictator in 49&amp;nbsp;BC possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within eleven days. In 48&amp;nbsp;BC, he was re-appointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46&amp;nbsp;BC, he was appointed dictator for ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot;&gt;Abbott, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator for life. Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; In October 45&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognize a single consul without a colleague.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot;&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot;&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt; which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him. The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; This was not the first time that Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity. After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury although a tribune had the seal placed on it. After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt;

[[File:RSC 0004a.6.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Denarius]] (42 BC) issued by '''Cassius Longinus''' and [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther#Death and family|Lentulus Spinther]], depicting the crowned head of [[Libertas|Liberty]] and on the reverse a sacrificial jug and ''[[lituus]]'', from the military mint in [[Smyrna]].]]
In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of &quot;Prefect of the Morals&quot;, which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the [[Roman censor|censors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot; /&gt; Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks that the ordinary censors were subject to, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honors upon him. He was, for example, given the title of &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; and &quot;''[[imperator]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; 

Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during senate meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt; 

Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit. This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] decades earlier, where individuals outside Rome and Italy were not considered &quot;Roman&quot;, and thus were not given full citizenship rights. This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus.

When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, and so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt; All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 138&quot;&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 136&quot; /&gt; 

Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt; This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot; /&gt;

===Assassination===
{{See also|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}
[[File:Karl Theodor von Piloty Murder of Caesar 1865.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Roman Senate|senator]]s encircle Caesar. A 19th century interpretation of the event by [[Carl Theodor von Piloty]].]]
On the [[Ides of March]] (15 March; see [[Roman calendar]]) of 44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. [[Mark Antony]], having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified ''Liberator'' named [[Servilius Casca]], and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for [[Trebonius]] to intercept him just as he approached the portico of [[Theatre of Pompey]], where the session was to be held, and detain him outside. (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to [[Brutus Albinus]]). When he heard the commotion from the senate chamber, Antony fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huzar|first=Eleanor Goltz|title=Mark Antony, a biography By Eleanor Goltz Huzar|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=1978|pages=79–80|isbn=978-0-8166-0863-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html |title=Plutarch – Life of Brutus |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and [[Suetonius]] say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's [[tunic]]. Caesar then cried to Cimber, &quot;Why, this is violence!&quot; (&quot;''Ista quidem vis est!''&quot;).&lt;ref name = &quot;suetonius&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html |title=Suetonius, ',Life of the Caesars, Julius', trans. J C Rolfe |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the same time, Casca produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, &quot;Casca, you villain, what are you doing?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Caesar'', ch. 66: &quot;{{lang|grc|ὁ μεν πληγείς, Ῥωμαιστί· 'Μιαρώτατε Κάσκα, τί ποιεῖς;}}'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Casca, frightened, shouted, &quot;Help, brother!&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]] (&quot;{{lang|grc|ἀδελφέ, βοήθει}}&quot;, &quot;''adelphe, boethei''&quot;). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], around 60 or more men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf Greg (2006), ''Et Tu Brute? – The Murder of Caesar and Political Assassination'', 199 pages – ISBN 1-86197-741-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'', c. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dictator's last words are not known with certainty, and are a contested subject among scholars and historians alike. Suetonius reports that others have said Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase &quot;{{lang|grc|καὶ σύ, τέκνον;}}&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#82.2 82.2]&lt;/ref&gt; (transliterated as &quot;''Kai su, teknon?''&quot;: &quot;You too, child?&quot; in English).  However, for himself, Suetonius says Caesar said nothing.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[John Carew Rolfe|J. C. Rolfe]] translation of 1914: &quot;...he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when Marcus Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, 'You too, my child?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#66.9 66.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The version best known in the English-speaking world is the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase &quot;''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''&quot; (&quot;And you, Brutus?&quot;, commonly rendered as &quot;You too, Brutus?&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stone|first=Jon R.|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2005|page=250|isbn=0-415-96909-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morwood|first=James|title=The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary (Latin-English)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1994|chapter=|isbn=0-19-860283-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this derives from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', where it actually forms the first half of a [[macaronic]] line: &quot;''Et tu, Brute?'' Then fall, Caesar.&quot; It has no basis in historical fact and Shakespeare's use of Latin here is not from any assertion that Caesar would have been using the language, rather than the Greek reported by Suetonius, but because the phrase was already popular when the play was written.&lt;ref&gt;It appears, for example, in [[Richard Edes]]'s Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke &amp;tc'' of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays. {{Cite book|title=The Works of William Shakespeare |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |authorlink= Alexander Dyce|coauthors=(quoting [[Edmond Malone|Malone]]) |year= 1866|publisher=Chapman and Hall |location= London|isbn= |page= 648|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Greek and Latin translation by J C Rolfe of [[Harvard University Press]]. Et can also mean too, when it is used as an adverb. see Lewis &amp; Short Latin dictionary--&gt;

According to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#67 67]&lt;/ref&gt; Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: &quot;People of Rome, we are once again free!&quot; They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumor of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.

Caesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation the [[Temple of Caesar]] was erected a few years later (at the east side of the main square of the [[Roman Forum]]). Nowadays, only its altar remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anamericaninrome.com/wp/2011/07/caesars-grave/ |title=Temple of Caesar |publisher=Anamericaninrome.com |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=7181 |title=Temple of Caesar |publisher=Findagrave.com |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A lifesize wax statue of Caesar was later erected in the forum displaying the 23 stab wounds. A crowd who had gathered there started a fire, which badly damaged the forum and neighboring buildings. In the ensuing chaos [[Mark Antony]], [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian (later Augustus Caesar)]], and others fought a series of five civil wars, which would end in the formation of the Roman Empire.

===Aftermath of the assassination===
[[File:M Antonius.jpg|thumb|upright]]
The result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVII 2.7.1]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman [[plebs|middle and lower classes]], with whom Caesar was immensely popular and had been since before Gaul, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar, capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the [[Optimates]], perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew Gaius [[Augustus|Octavian]] his sole heir, bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83.2 83.2]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the [[Liberators' civil war]], fulfilling at least in part Antony's threat against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_suetcaesar.htm |title=Suetonius, Life of Caesar, Chapters LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.

To combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With the passage of the ''lex Titia'' on 27 November 43 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire | author=Osgood, Josiah | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Second Triumvirate]] was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#13.1 13.1]; Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6]&lt;/ref&gt; It formally [[Apotheosis|deified]] Caesar as Divus Iulius in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became ''Divi filius'' (&quot;Son of a god&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Roman Religion | author=Warrior, Valerie M. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 110 | isbn = 0-521-82511-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Because Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate reinstated the practice of [[proscription]], abandoned since [[Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6.3]&lt;/ref&gt; It engaged in the legally sanctioned murder of a large number of its opponents to secure funding for its forty-five legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: An Introductory History | author=Zoch, Paul A. | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year = 200 | pages = 217–218| isbn = 0-8061-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavius defeated them at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.7.11–14]; Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html 5.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], Caesar's adopted heir.]]
Afterward, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's lover, Cleopatra, intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]], resulted in the permanent ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name that raised him to the status of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.34.66]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Caesar had been preparing to invade [[Parthia]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Scythia]], and then march back to [[Germania]] through Eastern Europe. These plans were thwarted by his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#58 58.6]&lt;/ref&gt; His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.

Julius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified. He was posthumously granted the title ''Divus Iulius'' or ''Divus Julius'' (the divine Julius or the deified Julius) by decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honors during his lifetime:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phillipic'' ii.110: Cicero refers to the divine honours of : &quot;...couch, image, pediment, priest&quot; given to Caesar in the months before his assassination.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly before his assassination, [[Mark Antony]] had been appointed as his ''[[flamen]]'' (priest).&lt;ref&gt;According to Dio Cassius, 44.6.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of Divus Iulius. After the death of Antony, [[Octavian]], as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of ''Divi Filius'' (son of a god).

==Personal life==

===Health and physical appearance===
Based on remarks by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 17, 45, 60; see also Suetonius, ''Julius'' 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from [[epilepsy]]. Modern scholarship is &quot;sharply divided&quot; on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald T. Ridley, &quot;The Dictator's Mistake: Caesar's Escape from Sulla,&quot; ''Historia'' 49 (2000), pp. 225–226, citing doubters of epilepsy: F. Kanngiesser, &quot;Notes on the Pathology of the Julian Dynasty,&quot; ''Glasgow Medical Journal'' 77 (1912) 428–432; T. Cawthorne, &quot;Julius Caesar and the Falling Sickness,” ''Proceedings of Royal Society of Medicine'' 51 (1957) 27–30, who prefers [[Ménière's disease]]; and O. Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness: A History of Epilepsy from the Greeks to the Beginnings of Modern Neurology'' (Baltimore 1971), p 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the commonly held belief that Caesar suffered from epilepsy, several specialists in headache medicine believe that a more accurate diagnosis would be migraine headache.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin, ''Conquering Your Migraine: The Essential Guide to Understanding and Treating Migraines for all Sufferers and Their Families'', (New York: Fireside, 2001), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had [[absence seizure]]s in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer [[Suetonius]], who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of [[hypoglycemia]], which can cause epileptoid seizures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004Caesar&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hughes J|title=Dictator Perpetuus: Julius Caesar—did he have seizures?

In 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the &quot;Caesar Complex&quot; theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodder|first=Harbour Fraser|date=September 2003|title=Epilepsy and Empire, Caveat Caesar|journal=Accredited Psychiatry &amp; Medicine|publisher=Harvard University|location=Harvard, Boston|volume=106|issue=1|page=19|url=http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artHarvardMagCaesar.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: ''Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf''.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''Julius Caesar'' I.ii.209.&lt;/ref&gt; No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defense.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 42; Jeremy Paterson discussing Caesar's health in general in &quot;Caesar the Man,&quot;  ''A Companion to Julius Caesar'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), p. 130 [http://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&amp;pg=PT150&amp;dq=julius+caesar+deaf&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zPtSTO-xFYaDngfwjbHvAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20caesar%20deaf&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman historian [[Suetonius]] describes Caesar as &quot;tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#45 45]: ''excelsa statura, colore candido, teretibus membris, ore paulo pleniore, nigris vegetisque oculis.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name and family===
{{Main|Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar}}
{{Main|Julio-Claudian family tree}}
Using the [[Latin alphabet]] as it existed in the day of Caesar (i.e., without lower case letters, &quot;J&quot;, or &quot;U&quot;), Caesar's name would be rendered &quot;GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR&quot;; the form &quot;CAIVS&quot; is also attested, using the old Roman representation of G by&amp;nbsp;C; it is an antique form of the more common &quot;GAIVS&quot;. The standard abbreviation was, and this is not archaic, &quot;C.&amp;nbsp;IVLIVS CAESAR&quot;. (The letterform &quot;Æ&quot; is a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]], which is often encountered in Latin [[inscription]]s where it was used to save space, and is nothing more than the letters &quot;ae&quot;.) 

In Classical Latin, it was [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|pronounced]] {{IPA-la|ˈɡaːjus ˈjuːljus ˈkajsar|}}. In the days of the late [[Roman Republic]], many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to [[Athens]] for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]]. In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], during Caesar's time, his family name was written ''Καίσαρ'', reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German [[Kaiser]]. 

In [[Vulgar Latin]], the plosive /k/ before [[front vowel]]s began, due to [[palatalization]], to be pronounced as an [[affricate]] – hence renderings like {{IPA|[ˈtʃeːsar]}} in Italian and {{IPA|[ˈtseːsar]}} in German [[Latin regional pronunciation|regional pronunciations of Latin]], as well as the title of [[Tsar]]. With the evolution of the [[Romance languages]], the affricate [ts] became a fricative [s] (thus, {{IPA|[ˈseːsar]}}) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original /k/ is preserved in [[Norse mythology]], where he is manifested as the legendary king [[Kjárr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carlaz&quot;&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf Anderson, Carl Edlund. (1999). ''Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia''. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic (Faculty of English). p. 44.]|308&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's [[cognomen]] would itself become a title; it was greatly promulgated by the Bible, by the famous verse &quot;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's&quot;. The title became the German [[Kaiser]] and Slavic [[Tsar]]/Czar. The last tsar in nominal power was [[Simeon II of Bulgaria]] whose reign ended in 1946; for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.

===Political rumors===
Roman society viewed the passive role during [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexual activity]], regardless of gender, to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar's Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, &quot;Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet.1.49&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Bibulus]], [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], and others (mainly Caesar's enemies), he had an affair with [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]] early in his career. The tales were repeated, referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. It is very likely that the rumors were spread only as a form of character assassination; Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to [[Cassius Dio]], even under oath on one occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet.1.2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. A favorite tactic used by the opposition was to accuse a popular political rival as living a Hellenistic lifestyle based on Greek and Eastern culture, where homosexuality and a lavish lifestyle were more acceptable than in Roman tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Catullus]] wrote two poems suggesting that Caesar and his engineer [[Mamurra]] were lovers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmina'' [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/029x.html 29], [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/057x.html 57]&lt;/ref&gt; but later apologised.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#73 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Antony]] charged that [[Augustus|Octavian]] had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antony's accusation of an affair with Octavian as political [[slander]]. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet.2.68&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#71 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
During his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin—even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Brutus'', 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|his funeral oration]] for his paternal aunt [[Julia (aunt of Caesar and wife of Marius)|Julia]] and his ''[[Anticato]]'', a document written to defame [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] in response to Cicero's published praise. [[Poems by Julius Caesar]] are also mentioned in ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 153–155 and 187–188. See also [[Poems by Julius Caesar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs===
[[File:Commentarii de Bello Gallico.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A 1783 edition of ''The Gallic Wars'']]
* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', usually known in English as ''The Gallic Wars,'' seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 50s BC, with the eighth book written by [[Aulus Hirtius]] on the last two years
* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (''The Civil War''), events of the Civil War from Caesar's perspective, until immediately after Pompey's death in Egypt.

Other works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:
* ''[[De Bello Alexandrino]]'' (''On the Alexandrine War''), campaign in Alexandria;
* ''[[De Bello Africo]]'' (''On the African War''), campaigns in North Africa; and
* ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi]]'' (''On the Hispanic War''), campaigns in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

These narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of &quot;dispatches from the front.&quot; They were important in shaping Caesar's public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, “The Publication of ''De Bello Gallico'',” ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'' (Classical Press of Wales, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As a model of clear and direct Latin style, ''The Gallic Wars'' traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.

Caesar was acclaimed ''Imperator'' in 60 and 45 BC. In the [[Roman Republic]], this was an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, an army's troops in the field would proclaim their commander ''imperator'', an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. After being acclaimed ''imperator'', the victorious general had a right to use the title after his name until the time of his [[Roman triumph|triumph]], where he would relinquish the title as well as his [[imperium]].
