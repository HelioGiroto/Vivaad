      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4744">'''Political socialization''' is a concept concerning the “study of the developmental processes by which children and adolescents acquire political cognition, attitudes, and behaviors”.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, L., &amp; Cowart, J. (2003). Political campaign communication: inside and out. Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a learning process by which norms and behavior acceptable to a well running political system are transmitted from one generation to another. It is through the performance of this function in which individuals are inducted into the political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed.&lt;ref&gt;Varkey, K. (2003). Political Theory A Philosophycal Perspective. Indian Publishers Distributors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agents of Socialization==
These Agents of Socialization all influence in one degree or another an individual's political opinions: Family, Media, Peers, Education, Religion, Race, Gender, Age and Geography.  These factors and many others that people are introduced to as they are growing up will affect their political views throughout the rest of their lives.  Political beliefs are often formed during childhood, as parents pass down their ideologies to their children.

==Factors==
The agents a child surrounds him/herself with during childhood are crucial to the child's development of future voting behaviors. Some of these agents include:
# Family: Glass (1986) recognizes family as a primary influence in the development of a child’s political orientation, mainly due to constant relationship between parents and child, detailed in the table [[#Family as a Primary Influence|Family as a Primary Influence]] below.&lt;ref&gt;J. Glass, V. B. (1986). Attitude similarity in three generational families: Socialization, status inheritance, or reciprocal influence? American Sociological Review , 685-698.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Schools: Most influential of all agents, after the family, due to the child's extended exposure to a variety of political beliefs, such as friends and teachers, both respected sources of information for students.
# Mass Media: Becker (1975) argue that the media functions as a medium of political information to adolescents and young children.&lt;ref&gt;L.B. Becker, M. M. (1975). Family traditions. In S. C. (ed), Political Communication: Issues and strategies for research (pp. 126–139). New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Religion: Religious tradition can have a strong effect on someones political views.  For example, Protestants tend to be more conservative (in countries where Protestants are not great majority).
# Political Parties: Scholars such as Campbell (1960) note that political parties have very little direct influence on a child due to a contrast of social factors such as age, context, power, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. M. (1960). The American Voter. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Work Place: Many work places tend to be liberal.
