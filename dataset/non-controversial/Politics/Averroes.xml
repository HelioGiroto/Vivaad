'''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾAbū l-Walīd Muḥammad bin ʾAḥmad bin Rušd}}''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الوليد محمد بن احمد بن رشد}}), commonly known as '''Ibn Rushd''' ({{lang-ar|ابن رشد}}) or by his [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] name '''Averroës''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|v|ɛr|oʊ|.|iː|z}}; April 14, 1126 – December 10, 1198), was an [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] [[polymath]]; a master of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], [[Islamic philosophy]], [[Islamic theology]], [[Maliki]] [[Sharia|law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]], [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], [[Political aspects of Islam|politics]], [[Arabic music]] theory, and the [[Science in medieval Islam|sciences]] of [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medicine]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Geography in medieval Islam|geography]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], [[Physics in medieval Islam|physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

According to [[Ernest Renan]], Averroes was also known as ''Ibin-Ros-din'', ''Filius Rosadis'', ''Ibn-Rusid'', ''Ben-Raxid'', ''Ibn-Ruschod'', ''Den-Resched'', ''Aben-Rassad'', ''Aben-Rois'', ''Aben-Rasd'', ''Aben-Rust'', ''Avenrosdy Avenryz'', ''Adveroys'', ''Benroist'', ''Avenroyth'' and ''Averroysta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Renan]], [http://www.archive.org/details/averrosetlaver00rena ''Averroès et l'Averroïsme: essai historique''], 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|245px|right|thumb|Averroes was the preeminent philosopher in the history of [[Al-Andalus]].]]

Averroes was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] to a family with a long and well-respected tradition of legal and public service. His grandfather Abu Al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was chief [[Qadi|judge]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] under the [[Almoravid]]s. His father, Abu Al-Qasim Ahmad, held the same position until the [[Almoravid]]s were replaced by the [[Almohad]]s in 1146.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad&quot; /&gt;

Averroes' education followed a traditional path, beginning with studies in [[Hadith]], [[linguistics]], [[jurisprudence]] and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[theology]]. Throughout his life he wrote extensively on [[Philosophy]] and [[Religion]], attributes of God, origin of the universe, [[Metaphysics]] and [[Psychology]]. It is generally believed that he was perhaps once tutored by [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace). His medical education was directed under [[Abu Jafar ibn Harun of Trujillo]] in [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiller&quot;&gt;H. Chad Hillier (2006). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/ibnrushd.htm Averroes (Averroes) (1126 - 1198 CE)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Averroes began his career with the help of [[Ibn Tufail]] (&quot;Aben Tofail&quot; to the West), the author of ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' and philosophic [[vizier]] of Almohad king [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] who was an amateur of philosophy and science. It was Ibn Tufail who introduced him to the court and to [[Ibn Zuhr]] (&quot;Avenzoar&quot; to the West), the great [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Muslim physician]], who became Averroes's teacher and friend. Averroes's aptitude for [[medicine]] was noted by his contemporaries and can be seen in his major enduring work ''Kitab al-Kulyat fi al-Tibb'' (Generalities) the work was influenced by the ''Kitab al-Taisir fi al-Mudawat wa al-Tadbir'' (Particularities) of [[Ibn Zuhr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;Bynum, WF &amp; Bynum, Helen (2006), ''Dictionary of Medical Biography'', Greenwood Press, ISBN 0-313-32877-3&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes later reported how it was also Ibn Tufail that inspired him to write his famous [[commentaries on Aristotle]]:

{{quote|Abu Bakr ibn Tufayl summoned me one day and told me that he had heard the [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] complaining about the disjointedness of [[Aristotle]]'s mode of expression — or that of the translators — and the resultant obscurity of his intentions. He said that if someone took on these books who could summarize them and clarify their aims after first thoroughly understanding them himself, people would have an easier time comprehending them. &quot;If you have the energy, &quot; Ibn Tufayl told me, &quot;you do it. I'm confident you can, because I know what a good mind and devoted character you have, and how dedicated you are to the art. You understand that only my great age, the cares of my office — and my commitment to another task that I think even more vital — keep me from doing it myself. &quot;|&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 314, [[Routledge]], ISBN 0-415-13159-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Averroes also studied the works and philosophy of [[Ibn Bajjah]] (&quot;Avempace&quot; to the West), another famous [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] who greatly influenced his own [[Averroism|Averroist]] thought.

However, while the thought of his mentors Ibn Tufail and Ibn Bajjah were [[Mysticism|mystic]] to an extent, the thought of Averroes was purely [[Rationalism|rationalist]]. Together, the three men are considered the greatest Andalusian philosophers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad&quot; /&gt; Averroes devoted the last 30 years to his philosophical writings.

In 1160, Averroes was made ''[[Qadi]]'' (judge) of [[Seville]] and he served in many court appointments in Seville, Cordoba, and [[Morocco]] during his career. Sometimes during the reign of [[Yaqub al-Mansur]], Averroes' political career was abruptly ended and he faced severe criticism from the [[Faqīh|Fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot;&gt;[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]], al-Mojib fi Talkhis Akhbar al-Maghrib [The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb], pp.150-151 (1224), King Saud University&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary of Averroes, [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] writing in 1224, reported that there were secret and public reasons for his falling out of favor with Yaqub al-Mansour:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot; /&gt;
{{quote
| text=And in his days [Yaqub al-Mansur], Abu al-Walid Ibn Rushd faced his severe ordeal and there were two causes for this; one is known and the other is secret. The secret cause, which was the major reason, is that Abu al-Walid [Averroes] —may God have mercy on his soul— when summarizing, commenting and expending upon Aristotle's book &quot;[[History of Animals]]&quot; wrote: &quot;And I saw the [[Giraffe]] at the garden of the king of the Berbers&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;And that is the same way he would mention another king of some other people or land, as it is frequently done by writers, but he omitted that those working for the service of the king should glorify him and observe the usual protocol. This was why they held a grudge against him [Averroes] but initially, they did not show it and in reality, Abu al-Walid wrote that inadvertently...Then a number of his enemies in Cordoba, who were jealous of him and were competing with him both in knowledge and nobility, went to Yaqub al-Mansur with excerpts of Abu Walid's work on some old philosophers which were in his own handwriting. They took one phrase out of context that said: &quot;and it was shown that Venus is one of the Gods&quot; and presented it to the king who then summoned the chiefs and noblemen of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and said to Abu al-Walid in front of them &quot;Is this your handwriting?&quot;. Abu al-Walid then denied and the king said &quot;May God curse the one who wrote this&quot; and ordered that Abu al-Walid be exiled and all the philosophy books to be gathered and burned...And I saw, when I was in [[Fes]], these books being carried on horses in great quantities and burned&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot; /&gt;
| sign=[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]]
| source=&quot;The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb&quot;, (1224)}}

Averroes's strictly rationalist views collided with the more orthodox views of [[Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]], who therefore eventually banished Averroes, though he had previously appointed him as his personal [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]]. Averroes was not reinstated until shortly before his death in the year 1198 AD.

{{See also|List of works by Averroes}}
Averroes's works were spread over 20,000 pages covering a variety of different subjects, including [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[logic in Islamic philosophy]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic medicine]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arabic mathematics]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomy]], [[Arabic grammar]], [[Islamic theology]], [[Sharia]] (Islamic law), and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence). In particular, his most important works dealt with [[Islamic philosophy]], medicine and Fiqh. He wrote at least 67 original works, which included 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle's works and his commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Averroes|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote commentaries on most of the surviving works of Aristotle. These were not based on primary sources (it is not known whether he knew [[Greek language|Greek]]), but rather on [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations. There were three levels of commentary: the ''Jami'', the ''Talkhis'' and the ''[[Tafsir]]'' which are, respectively, a simplified overview, an intermediate commentary with more critical material, and an advanced study of Aristotelian thought in a [[Muslim]] context. The terms are taken from the names of different types of commentary on the [[Qur'an]]. It is not known whether he wrote commentaries of all three types on all the works: in most cases only one or two commentaries survive.

He did not have access to any text of Aristotle's ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. As a substitute for this, he commented on Plato's ''The Republic'', arguing that the ideal state there described was the same as the original constitution of the Arab [[Caliphate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmad&quot; /&gt; as well as the [[Almohad]] state of [[Ibn Tumart]].

His most important original philosophical work was ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa''). Al-Ghazali argued that Aristotelianism, especially as presented in the writings of [[Avicenna]], was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of [[Islam]]. Averroes' rebuttal was two-pronged: he contended both that al-Ghazali's arguments were mistaken and that, in any case, the system of Avicenna was a distortion of genuine Aristotelianism so that al-Ghazali was aiming at the wrong target. Other works were the ''Fasl al-Maqal'', which argued for the legality of philosophical investigation under Islamic law, and the ''Kitab al-Kashf'', which argued against the proofs of Islam advanced by the [[Ash'ari]]te school and discussed what proofs, on the popular level, should be used instead.

Averroes is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the [[Maliki]] school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid'' ( بداية المجتهد و نهاية المقتصد), a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework.

[[Jacob Anatoli]] translated several of the works of Averroes from Arabic into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the 13th century. Many of them were later translated from Hebrew into [[Latin]] by [[Jacob Mantino]] and [[Abraham de Balmes]]. Other works were translated directly from Arabic into Latin by [[Michael Scot]]. Many of his works in [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]] have been permanently lost, while others, including some of the longer Aristotelian commentaries, have only survived in Latin or Hebrew translation, not in the original Arabic. The fullest version of his works is in Latin, and forms part of the multi-volume Juntine edition of Aristotle published in Venice 1562-1574.{{clear}}

==Science==
===Medicine===
Averroes wrote a medical encyclopedia called ''Kulliyat'' (&quot;Generalities&quot;, i. e. general medicine), known in its Latin translation as ''Colliget''. He also made a compilation of the works of [[Galen]], and wrote a commentary on the [[Canon of Medicine]] (Qanun fi 't-tibb) of [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) (980-1037).

===Physics===
Averroes also authored three books on physics namely: Short Commentary on the Physics, Middle Commentary on the Physics and Long Commentary on the Physics.
Averroes defined and measured force as &quot;the rate at which work is done in changing the kinetic condition of a material body&quot; and correctly argued &quot;that the effect and measure of force is change in the kinetic condition of a materially resistant mass&quot;. He took a particular and keen interest in the understanding of &quot;motor force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof: oso/9780199567737.001.0001/acprof-9780199567737&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=498OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=ibn+rushd+force&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KOpxHYLx6A&amp;sig=mdfAoC-wvB0KHQ2IF0PUXIRzfnI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7oDfTtjADYPSsgafouWCCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20rushd%20force&amp;f=false |title=IBN RUSHD: AVERROES PB - Urvoy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.pk |date=1991-04-25 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Averroes also developed the notion that bodies have a (non-gravitational) inherent resistance to motion into physics. This idea in particular was adopted by Thomas Aquinas and subsequently by Johannes Kepler, who refereed to this fact as &quot;Inertia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=dIWtmfwvItkC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=ibn+rushd+inertia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c4HfTs2jCYj6sga3uNXQCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20rushd%20inertia&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science - Rushdī Rāshid, Régis Morelon - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KfoQmi4o4zcC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=ibn+rushd+inertia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c4HfTs2jCYj6sga3uNXQCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20rushd%20inertia&amp;f=false |title=Renaissance of Sciences in Islamic Countries - Abdus Salam, H. R. Dalafi, Mohamed Hassan - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Optics]] Averroes followed [[Alhazen]]'s incorrect explanation that a [[Rainbow#Scientific history|Rainbow]] is due to [[Optics#Reflections|reflection]], not [[Optics#Refractions|refraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Hüseyin Gazi Topdemir, ''Kamal Al-Din Al-Farisi's Explanation of the Rainbow'', [http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf], Humanity &amp; Social Sciences Journal 2 (1): 75-85, 2007,p77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
Regarding his studies in astronomy, Averroes argued for a strictly concentric model of the universe, and explained [[sunspots]] and scientific reasoning regarding the occasional opaque colors of the [[moon]]. He also worked on the description of the spheres, and movement of the spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ibnrushd/#H7 |title=Ibn Rushd (Averroes) [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Averroes also made some studies regarding Active intellect and Passive intellect, both of the following were formerly regarded subjects of Psychology.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophybasics. com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&amp;pg=PA826&amp;dq=ibn+rushd+psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6YHfTvLQMMjwsgbNwqzbCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ#v=snippet&amp;q=psychology&amp;f=false |title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=BqQfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=ibn+rushd+psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6YHfTvLQMMjwsgbNwqzbCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA |title=Ibn Rushd's Metaphysics: A Translation with Introduction of Ibn Rushd's ... - Averročs - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.pk |date=1986-12-31 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===The Tradition of Islamic Philosophy===
Averroes furthered the tradition of Greek philosophy in the Islamic world (''[[falsafa]]''). His commentaries removed the neo-Platonic bias of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Criticizing [[al-Farabi]]'s attempt to merge Plato and Aristotle's ideas, Averroes argued that Aristotle's philosophy diverged in significant ways from Plato's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes rejected [[Avicenna]]'s [[Neoplatonism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was partly based on the works of neo-Platonic philosophers, [[Plotinus]] and Proclus, that were mistakenly attributed to Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Popkin|editor-first=Richard H.|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy|year=1999|publisher=MJF Books|pages=184–185}}. The works in question were the [[Liber de Causis]] and [[The Theology of Aristotle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], or more exactly [[ontology]], Averroes rejects the view advanced by Avicenna that existence is merely [[accidental property|accidental]]. Avicenna holds that &quot;essence is ontologically prior to existence&quot;. The accidental, i. e. attributes that are not essential, are additional contingent characteristics. Averroes, following Aristotle, holds that individual existing [[ousia|substances]] are primary. One may separate them mentally; however, ontologically speaking, existence and essence are one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hyman|editor-first=Arthur|title=Philosophy in the Middle Ages: The Christian, Islamic, and Jewish Traditions|publisher=Hackett Publishing Co.|edition=3rd|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60384-208-2|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Leaman|2002|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fakhry,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|pp=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; this represents a change from Plato's [[theory of forms|theory of Ideas]], where ideas precede particulars, to Aristotle's theory where particulars come first and the essence is &quot;arrived at by a process of abstraction. &quot;

===Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato===
[[File:Bnf lat16151 f22.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Commentarium magnum Averrois in Aristotelis'' ''[[De Anima]] libros''. French Manuscript, third quarter of the 13th century.]]
Averroes wrote commentaries on most of the surviving works of [[Aristotle]] working from Arabic translations. He wrote three types of commentaries. The short commentary (''jami'') is generally an epitome; the middle commentary (''talkhis'') is a paraphrase; the long commentary (''tafsir'') includes the whole text with a detailed analysis of each line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=McGinnis|editor-first=Jon|title=Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources|publisher=Hackett Pub Co Inc|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87220-871-1|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the European scholars who came after him, Averroes argued that rhetoric and poetics were both part of Aristotle's work on logical thought.{{citation needed|date = September 2012}}

Averroes, not having access to Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]], substituted Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]. Averroes, following Plato's paternalistic model, advances an authoritarian ideal. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|edition=2nd|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7486-3987-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Averroes, following Plato, accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Averroes|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent philosophical works===
His most important original philosophical work was ''The Incoherence of the Incoherence'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa''). Al-Ghazali argued that Aristotelianism, especially as presented in the writings of [[Avicenna]], was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of [[Islam]]. Averroes' rebuttal was two-pronged: he contended both that al-Ghazali's arguments were mistaken and that, in any case, the system of Avicenna was a distortion of genuine Aristotelianism so that al-Ghazali was aiming at the wrong target.

Other works were the ''Fasl al-Maqal'', which argued for the legality of philosophical investigation under Islamic law, and the ''Kitab al-Kashf''.

[[Jacob Anatoli]] translated his works from Arabic to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the 13th century. Many of them were later translated from Hebrew to Latin by [[Jacob Mantino]] and others. Other works were translated directly from Arabic to Latin by [[Michael Scot]]. Many of his works in [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]] have been permanently lost, while others, including some of the longer Aristotelian commentaries, have only survived in Latin or Hebrew translation, not in the original Arabic. The fullest version of his works is in Latin, and forms part of the multi-volume Juntine edition of Aristotle published in Venice 1562-1574.

===System of philosophy===
{{main|Averroism}}
Averroes tried to reconcile Aristotle's system of thought with [[Islam]]. According to him, there is no conflict between [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], rather that they are different ways of reaching the same truth. He believed in the [[eternity]] of the [[universe]]. He also held that the [[soul]] is divided into two parts, one individual and one divine; while the individual soul is not eternal, all humans at the basic level share one and the same divine soul. Averroes has two kinds of Knowledge of Truth. The first being his knowledge of truth of religion being based in faith and thus could not be tested, nor did it require training to understand. The second knowledge of truth is philosophy, which was reserved for an elite few who had the intellectual capacity to undertake its study.

==Significance==
[[File:Averroes closeup.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Averroes, detail of the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]].]]
Averroes is most famous for his commentaries of Aristotle's works, which had been mostly forgotten in the [[Western world|West]]. Before 1150 only a few translated works of Aristotle existed in Latin Europe (i. e. excluding Greek [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]), and they were not studied much or given as much credence by monastic scholars. It was in part through the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations of Averroes's work beginning in the 12th century that the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the Latin West.

Averroes's work on Aristotle spans almost three decades, and he wrote commentaries on almost all of Aristotle's work except for Aristotle's ''Politics'', to which he did not have access. Hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on [[Jewish philosophy]]. [[Moses Maimonides]], [[Samuel ibn Tibbon|Samuel Ben Tibbon]], Juda Ben Solomon Choen, and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem Tob Ben Joseph Falaquera]] were Jewish philosophers influenced by Averroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were assimilated by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others (especially in the [[University of Paris]]) within the [[Christian]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition which valued Aristotelian logic. Famous scholastics such as Aquinas believed him to be so important they did not refer to him by name, simply calling him &quot;The Commentator&quot; and calling Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher. &quot; Averroes had no discernible influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Leaman|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death coincides with a change in the culture of Al-Andalus. In his work ''Fasl al-Maqāl'' (translated a. o. as ''The Decisive Treatise''), he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the [[Qur'an]].

==Jurisprudence and law==
Averroes is also a highly-regarded legal scholar of the [[Maliki]] school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is &quot;Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid, &quot; a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework, which is renderd in English as ''The Distinguished Jurist's Primer''&lt;ref&gt;Nyazee, The Distinguished Jurist's Primer, 2 vols. (Reading: Garnet Publishing 1994 &amp; 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;—. He is also the author of &quot;al-Bayān wa'l-Taḥṣīl, wa'l-Sharḥ wa'l-Tawjīh wa'l-Ta`līl fi Masā'il al-Mustakhraja, &quot; a long and detailed commentary based on the &quot;Mustakhraja&quot; of Muḥammad al-`Utbī al-Qurtubī.

==Cultural influences==
* Reflecting the respect which [[medieval]] [[Europe]]an scholars paid to him, Averroes is named by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' with the great pagan philosophers whose spirits dwell in &quot;the place that favor owes to fame&quot; in [[Limbo]].
* Averroes appears in a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], entitled &quot;[[Averroes's Search]]&quot;, in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words ''[[tragedy]]'' and ''[[comedy]]''. He is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] alongside [[Maimonides]]. He appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of Cordoba in [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s poem ''In Cordoba''. He is also the main character in ''Destiny'', a [[Youssef Chahine]] film.
* Averroes is also the title of a play called &quot;The Gladius and The Rose&quot;, written by Tunisian writer [[Mohamed Ghozzi]], and which had the first price in the theater festival in Charjah in 1999.
* The [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] was named in his honor. Plant genus ''[[Averrhoa]]'' was named after him.
* The Muslim pop musician [[Kareem Salama]] composed and performed a song in 2007 titled ''Aristotle and Averroes''.
* Averroes is the subject of the film [[Destiny (1997 film)|Al Massir]] by [[Youssef Chahine]].
