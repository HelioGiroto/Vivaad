The '''Islamic Thinkers Society''' is a Muslim group based in [[New York City]] that seeks the goal of restoring the [[Islam]]ic [[Caliphate]] to create what they call &quot;an ideal Islamic society.&quot; They are located mainly in [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]], [[United States]].

Islamic Thinkers Society is an offshoot of [[Al-Muhajiroun]], a pro Al-Qaeda British Islamist extremist group.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/11/n-j-suspects-attended-protests-organized-by-radical-islamic-group/ |title=N.J. suspects attended protests organized by radical Islamic group – This Just In – CNN.com Blogs |publisher=News.blogs.cnn.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
The group states they wish to see a reversal of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] and [[San Remo conference]]. They allege these agreements are part of 'Colonialist Designs' on the [[Islamic world]], and they urge Muslims to consider them illegal, null and void. The group calls for an end to what it says are &quot;Colonialist-Imposed Borders,&quot; &quot;Colonialist-Imposed States,&quot; and &quot;Colonialist-Imposed Rulers.&quot; They also show dislike for Jews, Christians, homosexuals and Shi'ites.

ITS calls on Muslims to oppose the United States, [[Christianity]] and Western society and culture, especially [[homosexuality]], which they see as Western.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} ITS is also notable for its hostility to [[Shi'ite]]s whom they view as not true Muslims.

==Controversy==
ITS is suspected of being an American offshoot of the London-based [[Al-Muhajiroun]], a group that celebrated the 9/11 attacks, referring to the hijackers as &quot;the Magnificent 19,&quot; and posted a burning picture of the [[United States Capitol]] on its website. The Islamic Thinkers Society also used to fly the Al-Muhajiroun flag and distributed Al-Muhajiroun tracts. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] called ITS &quot;a pseudonym or an offshoot of the British-based Al Muhajiroun, a now-disbanded radical Islamic group that supported terrorism and the imposition of Islamic hegemony worldwide.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] | title=Anti-Israel Protests – 2005 | date=May 13, 2005 | accessdate=September 12, 2007 | url=http://www.adl.org/main_israel/anti-israel-protests_2005.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the CNN program ''[[ParkerSpitzer]]'', the ex-leader of Al-Muhajiroun, [[Anjem Choudary]], was interviewed with the title &quot;heinous terrorist&quot; and linked to militant groups like Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2010/10/29/ps.cleric.choudary.cnn ''ParkerSpitzer'' - Anjem Choudary's &quot;henious terrorist&quot; interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Choudary however, denounced these allegations in a press release on his personal website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anjemchoudary.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=47:cnn-lies-in-attempt-to-entrap-a-muslim&amp;Itemid=7 CNN LIES IN ATTEMPT TO ENTRAP A MUSLIM]&lt;/ref&gt; The ITS organization have also published a press release in response to the CNN interview supporting Al-Muhajiroun's former leader Anjem Choudary, but denouncing links to violence in a similar fashion, stating &quot;as the struggle [of ITS] is always intellectual and political.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicthinkers.com/index/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=712&amp;Itemid=2 Press Release: CNN Lies and Spitzer's Entrapment]&lt;/ref&gt;

When they still called themselves Al-Muhajiroun, they held an event at [[Queensborough Community College]], during which a Al-Muhajiroun speaker said, &quot;We reject the U.N., reject America, reject all law and order. Don't lobby Congress or protest because we don't recognize Congress! The only relationship you should have with America is to topple it!&quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Observers such as the Intelligence Summit have called the Islamic Thinkers Society a [[Fundamentalist]] [[Islam]]ic group.

Before he founded Revolution Muslim, Yousef al Khattab was the chief ideologue of the Islamic Thinkers Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

[[Bryant Neal Vinas]], a Hispanic Catholic convert to Islam from Long Island who was convicted of participating in and supporting Al-Qaeda plots in Afghanistan and the U.S., moved in Islamic Thinkers Society circles in New York before he left the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  CNN reported that followers of the Islamic Thinkers Society helped radicalize Vinas and helped him connect with Islamist militants in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Activities==
The group is based in the largely immigrant community of the [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]] neighborhood in  [[Queens]], [[New York City]] but operates in the wider New York area. It is composed mainly of second-generation young [[Arab]], [[India]]n, [[Bangladesh]]i and [[Pakistan]]i Muslim immigrants with a few converts.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Andrea. &quot;Queens Muslim Group Says It Opposes Violence, and America.&quot; The New York Times, June 22, 2005 pB1&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
*On March 19, 2005, the organization protested the intergender Muslim service held at Synod House of the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of St. John the Divine]]. ITS members stood outside the service, irate that a woman was allowed to lead the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Andrea. &quot;With Women at the Forefront, a Muslim Service Challenges Tradition.&quot; The New York Times, March 19, 2005 pB3 col 02.&lt;/ref&gt;

*They changed their name to the Islamic Thinkers Society and held a rally against [[Israel]], co-sponsored by the [[Islamic Society of Bay Ridge]], in New York City outside the Israeli mission to the [[United Nations]] on May 6, 2005. Placards were displayed which equated Nazi and Israeli symbols; other signs were emblazoned with the symbol of the [[Hamas]] militant group, and proclaimed that &quot;Palestine is Islamic Land,&quot; &quot;Allah Will Destroy the Terrorist State of Israel,&quot; and &quot;Complete Liberation of Palestine From the Zionist Scum.&quot; One of the slogans shouted by the crowd in Arabic was the anti-Jewish slogan: &quot;Khaibar, Khaibar ya Yahud, jaysh Muhammad sawfa ya'ud!&quot; evoking the historical [[Battle of Khaybar|battle]] between the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and the [[Jews]] of the [[Khaybar]] oasis.

*On March 23, 2004 a rally to mourn the death of the militant leader [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]], the founder of the group [[Hamas]] was also held in front of the Israeli consulate. The leader of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, Imam Red Shata, who was quoted by the [[NY Daily News]], publicly stated, &quot;The lion of Palestine has been martyred.&quot; In the same speech, he condemned all violence. he stated that &quot;we don't hate Jews ...to kill one man is to kill all mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/nyregion/06imam.html?pagewanted=4&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=b3814cd1ec651da1&amp;ex=1166158800 | work=The New York Times | title=To Lead the Faithful in a Faith Under Fire | first=Andrea | last=Elliott | date=March 6, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On June 8, 2005 the ITS publicly desecrated and ripped up an American flag on the street in New York City during a rally at 74th Street and 37th Avenue in the borough of Queens. This event, which they called &quot;Operation: Desecrate American Flag&quot; was videotaped by the Islamic Thinkers Society and can be seen on the [[Internet]]. Their five-minute video begins with a man speaking in [[English language|English]], &quot;Just to show where our loyalty belongs to – you see this flag here? It's going to go on the floor [sic]. And to us, our loyalty does not belong to this flag, our loyalty belongs to Allah ... .&quot; Another speaker refers to the mandate for &quot;Islam to dominate over all other religions, to dominate the world, even though the non-[[Muslim]]s may hate it.&quot;

*The negative press reaction led the organization to issue a statement on their website stating, &quot;This flag also represents oppression, not only in the Muslim world, but also other parts of the world which includes but not limited to South America, Vietnam, Japan &amp; Africa. We would like to clarify that we DID NOT BURN THE FLAG as the rumors say. Rather, we stepped on it and ripped it. The video is evident of that. What we did was completely legal and protected by the American Constitutional Amendment.&quot; Flag desecration is allowed under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

===2006===
*On Feb 18, 2006, the Islamic Thinkers Society participated in a demonstration against [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons that portrayed the Prophet Muhammed as a terrorist]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem. &quot;More Than 1,000 Protest Cartoon Depiction of Prophet.&quot; The New York Times, Feb 18, 2006 pB3.&lt;/ref&gt; The rally, which was organized by the Muslim Leadership Council, brought over one thousand Muslims to protest the cartoons across from the Danish Consulate in Manhattan.

*On April 20, 2006, the ITS demonstrated in front of the Israeli consulate in Manhattan and publicly called for the nuclear destruction of Israel&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interview With Steve Emerson.&quot; Hannity &amp; Colmes. Televised on FOX News. 04/24/2006&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The mushroom cloud is on its way! The real [[Holocaust]] is on its way!&quot; and &quot;Israel won't last long. Indeed, Allah will repeat the Holocaust right on the soil of Israel!&quot; The demonstration included signs that read &quot;Islam will Dominate&quot; and featured a picture with an Islamic flag flying over the [[White House]]. A video of this event was also made available to the public on the Internet.

*On July 18, 2006, the ITS was again in front of the Israeli embassy with their signs, standing with a crowd that was chanting &quot;Long live Hezbollah&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
