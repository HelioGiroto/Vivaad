'''Christianity''' (from the {{lang-grc|Χριστιανός|Christianos}}&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;The term &quot;Christian&quot; ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Χριστιανός}}) was first used in reference to Jesus' [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in the city of [[Antioch]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|11:26}} about 44&amp;nbsp;AD, meaning &quot;followers of Christ&quot;. The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch, probably in derision, to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were &quot;brethren&quot;, &quot;the faithful&quot;, &quot;elect&quot;, &quot;saints&quot;, &quot;believers&quot;. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; (Greek {{lang|grc|Χριστιανισμός}}) was by [[Ignatius of Antioch]], around 100&amp;nbsp;AD. See Elwell/Comfort. ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'', pp. 266, 828.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Late Latin|Latin]] suffix ''-itas'') is a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[religion]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Monotheism&quot;&gt;Christianity's status as monotheistic is affirmed in, amongst other sources, the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (article &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]&quot;); [[William F. Albright]], ''From the Stone Age to Christianity''; [[H.

Adherents of the Christian faith are known as [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;

The mainstream Christian belief is that Jesus is the [[Son of God]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully divine and fully human]] and the [[Salvation (Christianity)|savior of humanity]]. Because of this, Christians commonly refer to Jesus as Christ or [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs&quot;&gt;Briggs, Charles A. ''The fundamental Christian faith: the origin, history and interpretation of the Apostles' and Nicene creeds.'' C. Scribner's sons, 1913. [http://books.google.com/books?id=VKMPAAAAIAAJ Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jesus' [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[crucifixion of Jesus|sacrificial death]], and subsequent [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] are often referred to as the [[Gospel]], meaning &quot;[[Good News (Christianity)|Good News]]&quot; (from the {{lang-grc-gre|εὐαγγέλιον|euangélion}}). In short, the Gospel is news of [[God]] [[God the Father|the Father's]] eternal victory over [[evil]],&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], from the Glossary in Wright’s ''For Everyone'' series, via article &quot;Gospel definitions&quot;: &quot;The idea of 'good news...'&quot; &quot;...it mean the news of [[YHWH]]’s long-awaited victory over evil and rescue of his people.&quot; http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevinwax/2008/09/04/gospel-definitions-nt-wright/&lt;/ref&gt; and the promise of [[salvation]] and [[eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] for all people, through [[divine grace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Romans]] 6:23: &quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Worldwide, the three largest groups of Christianity are the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the various denominations of [[Protestantism]]. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox [[patriarchate]]s split from one another in the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054&amp;nbsp;AD, and Protestantism came into existence during the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, splitting from the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=anagignoskomena#v=onepage&amp;q=anagignoskomena&amp;f=true |title=Orthodox and Wesleyan Scriptural understanding and practice

Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah [[Bible prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], referred to as the &quot;Old Testament&quot; in Christianity. The foundation of Christian [[theology]] is expressed in the early Christian [[ecumenical creeds]] which contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Defined to avoid the ambiguous term &quot;orthodox&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Profession (religious)|professions]] state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was [[resurrection|resurrected]] from the dead in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust him for the [[forgiveness#Christianity|remission]] of their [[Christian views on sin|sin]]s ([[salvation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sheed, Frank. ''Theology and Sanity''. (Ignatius Press: San Francisco, 1993), pp. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; They further maintain that Jesus bodily [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended]] into heaven where he rules and reigns with [[God the Father]]. Most [[Christian denomination|denominations]] teach that Jesus will [[Second Coming|return]] to [[Last Judgment|judge]] all humans, living and dead, and grant [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] to his followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/traditions/christianity |title=Christianity |work=Knowledge Resources |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the [[role model|model]] of a [[virtue|virtuous]] life, and both the [[revelation|revealer]] and physical [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath4&quot;&gt;McGrath, ''Christianity: An Introduction'', pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Apostles Creed}}
{{Wikisource|Nicene Creed}}
Though there are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible on which Christianity is based, Christians share a set of beliefs that they hold as essential to their faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olsen&quot;&gt;Olson, ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creeds ===
{{Main|Creeds}}
Creeds (from Latin ''credo'' meaning &quot;I believe&quot;) are concise doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.

Many [[evangelical]] Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the  substance of the creeds. [[Baptists|The Baptists]] have been non-creedal “in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another.”&lt;ref name=Avis&gt;Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, ISBN 0-281-05246-8 paperback&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.111}} Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the [[Restoration Movement]], such as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]] and the [[Churches of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;White, ''[http://www.appiusforum.com/restoration.html The History of the Church]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cummins | first = Duane D. | authorlink = | title = A handbook for Today's Disciples in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Revised Edition | publisher = Chalice Press | year = 1991 | location = St Louis, MO | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8272-1425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14-15}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes 2005&quot;&gt;Ron Rhodes, ''The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations'', Harvest House Publishers, 2005, ISBN 0-7369-1289-4&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123}}

The [[Apostles' Creed]] remains the most popular statement of the articles of Christian faith that are generally acceptable to most Christian denominations that are creedal. It is widely used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of [[Western Christian]] tradition, including the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Western Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]]. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan/Hotchkiss, ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main points:

* belief in [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]
* the [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Harrowing of Hell|descent into hell]], [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ
* the holiness of the [[Ecclesia (church)|Church]] and the [[communion of saints]]
* Christ's [[second coming]], the [[Day of Judgement]] and [[salvation]] of the faithful.

The [[Nicene Creed]], largely a response to [[Arianism]], was formulated at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively&lt;ref&gt;Catholics United for the Faith, [http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=191 &quot;We Believe in One God&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', &quot;Arianism&quot;.{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ratified as the universal creed of [[Christendom]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.&lt;ref name=&quot;ephesus&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm Council of Ephesus]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chalcedonian Creed]], developed at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451,&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Christianity|Christian History]] Institute, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080106201425/http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2003/10/daily-10-08-2003.shtml ''First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon''].&lt;/ref&gt; though rejected by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon|url=http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php|work=Glastonbury Review|publisher=[[British Orthodox Church|The British Orthodox Church]]|author=Peter Theodore Farrington|year=2006|month=February|issue=113|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080619122112/http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php|archivedate=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; taught Christ &quot;to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably&quot;: one divine and one human, and that both natures are perfect but are nevertheless [[Hypostatic union|perfectly united into one person]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo I, [http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/4ecumen2.htm Letter to Flavian'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Athanasian Creed]], received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: &quot;We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the [[Consubstantiality|Substance]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians ([[Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806| title = Our Common Heritage as Christians |publisher = The United Methodist Church |accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ten Commandments ====

The [[Ten Commandments]], are a set of [[biblical]] principles relating to [[ethics]] and [[worship]], which play a fundamental role in [[Judaism]] and most forms of Christianity. They include instructions to worship only [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] and to keep the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], and prohibitions against [[Idolatry in Christianity|idolatry]], [[Christ's sakes|blasphemy]], [[You shall not murder|murder]], [[You shall not steal|theft]], and [[adultery]]. Different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them. According to the synoptic gospels, Christ generalised the law into two underlying principles; The first is ''Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'' While the second is ''You shall love your neighbor as yourself.''{{bibleref2c|Matthew|22:34-40}}{{bibleref2c|Mark|12:28-33}} These are in fact quotes from {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|6:4}} and {{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:18}}. Barnes' Notes on the New Testament comments on these verses saying: &quot;These comprehend the substance of what Moses in the law, and what the prophets have spoken. What they have said has been to endeavour (sic) to win men to the love of God and each other. Love to God and man comprehends the whole [of] religion; and to produce this has been the design of Moses, the prophets, the Saviour, and the apostles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Albert|title=Barnes' New Testament Notes, Entry for  Matthew 22:40|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/barnes/ntnotes.iv.xxii.xl.html|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jesus Christ ===
{{Main|Christian views of Jesus|Christology|Jesus Christ in comparative mythology}}
[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A depiction of Jesus as a child with his mother, Mary, the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]]. 12th century, [[Russia]].]]

The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]] (Christ). The title &quot;Messiah&quot; comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word מָשִׁיחַ (''māšiáħ'') meaning ''anointed one''. The Greek translation {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christos'') is the source of the English word &quot;[[Christ (title)|Christ]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath4&quot;/&gt;

Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Messianic prophecies of Jesus|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', pp. 513, 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been many [[Christian theology|theological]] disputes over the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]] over the earliest centuries of Christian history, Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and &quot;[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]&quot; (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], &quot;God raised him from the dead&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:31–32}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40–41}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15 || 1 Cor. 15:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14 || 2 Cor. 4:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{Bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10 || 1 Thess. 11:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Heb.|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3 || 1 Pet. 1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; he [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven, is &quot;seated at the right hand of the Father&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed |title=Nicene Creed—Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will ultimately return{{bibleref2c|Acts|1:9–11}} to fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[Resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]] and final establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].

According to the [[Gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|conceived]] by the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical Gospels, however [[infancy Gospels]] were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the Gospels contained within the [[New Testament]]. The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], preaching, [[Ministry of Jesus|teaching, and deeds]].

=== Death and resurrection of Jesus ===
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}
[[File:Cristo crucificado.jpg|thumb|230px|right|''[[Christ Crucified (Velázquez)|Crucifixion]]'', representing the death of [[Jesus]] on the [[Christian Cross|Cross]], painting by [[Diego Velázquez|D. Velázquez]], 17th c.]]

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see [[1 Corinthians 15]]) and the most important event in human history.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACU-Death &amp; Resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm| title = The Significance of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus for the Christian|publisher = Australian Catholic University National|accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Got Questions-Death &amp; Resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/resurrection-Christ-important.html| title = Why is the resurrection of Jesus Christ important?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Testament Jesus was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died a physical death, was buried within a tomb, and rose from the dead three days later.{{bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30–31}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|16:1}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Mark|16:6}} The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], including &quot;more than five hundred brethren at once&quot;,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:6}} before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during [[Holy Week]] which includes [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in [[Christian Theology]], partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2 || John|3:16}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|5:24}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:39–40}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:47}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|10:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|11:25–26}}, and {{bibleref2-nb|John|17:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', works contained in the ''Book of Concord''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the [[historical Jesus]] and the proclamation of the [[early church]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Foundations of New Testament Christology'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,&lt;ref&gt;A [[Jesus Seminar]] conclusion: &quot;in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on [[vision hypothesis|visionary experiences]] of [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk. ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?''.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing [[mythology|myth]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, &quot;If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.&quot;{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:14}} &lt;ref&gt;Ball/Johnsson (ed.). ''The Essential Jesus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salvation ===
{{Main|Salvation}}

[[Paul of Tarsus]], like Jews and Roman [[pagan]]s of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity, and eternal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;remedy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |year=2004 |month=Winter |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans

''What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?'' (Oxford, 1997), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the &quot;mortal bodies&quot; of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the &quot;children of God&quot; and were therefore no longer &quot;in the flesh&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:9,11,16}} &lt;ref name=&quot;remedy&quot; /&gt;

Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be [[eternal salvation|saved]] from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary death and resurrection]]. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by [[Divine grace|God's grace]], sometimes defined as &quot;unmerited favor&quot;, even apart from baptism.

Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are [[total depravity|completely incapable of self-redemption]], but that [[irresistible grace|sanctifying grace is irresistible]].&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Confession, [http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm#chapx Chapter X]; Spurgeon, ''[http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestants believe that the exercise of [[free will]] is necessary to have faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Grace and Justification|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100815001751/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archivedate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trinity ===
{{Main|Trinity}}
[[File:Abraham-And-The-Three-Angels.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Three angels hosted by Abraham by [[Ludovico Carracci]]: The three angels represent the [[Godhead (Christianity)|three persons]] of God.]]

''Trinity'' refers to the teaching that the one God comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons; the ''[[God the Father|Father]]'', the ''Son'' (incarnate in Jesus Christ), and the ''[[Holy Spirit]]''. Together, these three persons are sometimes called the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander. ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology''. p. 514f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath. ''Historical Theology''. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 782.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the [[Athanasian Creed]], an early statement of Christian belief, &quot;the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''The Athanasian Creed''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, &quot;Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg1207&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trinity]] is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit&quot; represents both the [[immanence]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of God. God is believed to be infinite and God's presence may be perceived through the actions of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.&lt;!-- ref supports entire paragraph --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler. ''World Religions: An Introduction for Students''. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in [[Western Christian]] theology) [[Filioque|from the Son]]. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three 'persons' are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[omnipotent]].

The word ''trias'', from which ''trinity'' is derived, is first seen in the works of [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. He wrote of &quot;the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus of Antioch ''Apologia ad Autolycum'' II 15&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''De Pudicitia'' chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trinitarians ====
{{Main|Trinitarianism}}

''Trinitarianism'' denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the ''[[Trinity]]''. Almost all Christian denominations and Churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words &quot;Trinity&quot; and &quot;Triune&quot; do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as Father, God as Jesus the Son, and God as the Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply three gods, nor that each member of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God; Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.&lt;ref&gt;Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. ISBN 0-8006-2825-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nontrinitarians ====
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}

[[Nontrinitarianism]] refers to [[Christian theology|beliefs systems]] that reject the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. They are a small minority of Christians. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[adoptionism]] or [[modalism]], existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century.

=== Scriptures ===
{{Main|Bible|Development of the Christian Biblical canon}}

Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the [[Biblical canon]], the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]], as the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that, what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word used to describe inspiration in {{bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}} is ''Theopneustos'', which literally means &quot;God-breathed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation |edition=2nd |last=Virkler |first=Henry A. |editor-last=Ayayo |editor-first=Karelynne Gerber |year=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids, USA |isbn=978-0-8010-3138-0 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles &quot;[[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]&quot;. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, though none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the [[King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100909213651/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archivedate=9 September 2010}}(§105-108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another view closely related is [[Biblical infallibility]] or Limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography, or science. 
The [[Books of the Bible]], considered to be inspired, among Judaism, and the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant churches vary, thus each define the canon differently, although there is substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[traditions]] and [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Bible always includes books of the [[Tanakh]], the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This makes up what Christians regard as the Old Testament. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the [[Deuterocanonical Books]], as part of the Old Testament. These Books appear in the [[Septuagint]], but are regarded by Protestants to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament, originally written in [[Koine Greek]], contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.

==== Catholic and Orthodox interpretations ====
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Saint Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], the largest church in the world and a symbol of the [[Catholic Church]].]]
In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture [[allegory|allegorically]], while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''[[theoria]]'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 69–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115-118]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The ''spiritual'' sense is further subdivided into:

* the ''allegorical'' sense, which includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a &quot;type&quot; (sign) of baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:2}}
* the ''[[moral]]'' sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* the ''[[anagoge|anagogical]]'' sense, which applies to [[eschatology]], eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]]

Regarding [[exegesis]], following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:

* the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm &quot;Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* that scripture must be read within the &quot;living Tradition of the whole Church&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III &quot;The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture&quot; § 113]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* that &quot;the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III &quot;The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith&quot; § 85]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protestant interpretation ====

; Clarity of Scripture:Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and [[Revelation|revealed all truth]] necessary for salvation. This concept is known as ''[[sola scriptura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mathison. ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''.{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or &quot;perspicuous&quot;), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be &quot;enveloped in darkness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot; /&gt; He advocated &quot;one definite and simple understanding of Scripture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot;&gt;Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml '' Martin Luther and Scripture''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] wrote, &quot;all who...follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol45/htm/vii.iv.iv.htm '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14–18]&lt;/ref&gt; The Second [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zurich (successor to Protestant reformer [[Zwingli]]) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071211005549/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm ''Of Interpreting the Holy Scriptures; and of Fathers, Councils, and Traditions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

; Original intended meaning of Scripture:Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the [[historical-grammatical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Sproul. ''Knowing Scripture'', pp. 45–61; Bahnsen, ''[http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (article 6)].&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in [[Biblical hermeneutics]] to find the intended original meaning in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some Protestant interpreters make use of typology.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., in his [http://eword.gospelcom.net/comments/matthew/mh/matthew1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.3) [[Matthew Henry]] interprets the twin sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and [[Jewish Christians]]. For a contemporary treatment, see Glenny, ''[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eschaton ===
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}

The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the [[Great Tribulation|Tribulation]], death and the afterlife, the [[Rapture]], the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, [[Resurrection of the Dead]], Heaven and Hell, [[Millennialism]], the [[Last Judgment]], the end of the world, and the [[New Heavens and New Earth]].

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the [[eschatology|end of time]] after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Calvin | first =John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Three, Ch. 25 | work = | publisher =www.reformed.org | date = | url =http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html | doi = | accessdate =2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death and Afterlife====
Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or [[hell|eternal damnation]]. This includes the [[Last Judgment|general judgement]] at the [[Resurrection of the dead]] as well as the belief (held by Roman Catholics,&lt;ref name=&quot;CEParticularJudgement&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott&quot;&gt;Ott, ''Grundriß der Dogmatik'', p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, ''[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Collins, ''[http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and most Protestants) in a [[particular judgment|judgment particular to the individual soul]] upon physical death.

In Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_04081999_en.html |title=Audience of 4 August 1999 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have attained this goal are called ''saints'' (Latin ''sanctus'', &quot;holy&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, including Anglicans, Lutherans and Seventh-day Adventists hold to [[Christian mortalism|mortalism]], the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to [[Annihilationism]], the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, &quot;the dead are conscious of nothing.&quot; What is God's Purpose for the Earth?&quot; Official Site of Jehovah's Witnesses. ''Watchtower'', July 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worship ==
{{Main|Christian worship}}
[[File:Thebible33.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Samples of [[Catholic]] religious objects—The [[Holy Bible]], a [[Crucifix]], and a [[Rosary]].]]

[[Justin Martyr]] described 2nd century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''[[First Apology]]'' (''c''. 150) to [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:

{{quotation|And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.|Justin Martyr&lt;ref name=justin&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the Gospels. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession, and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed. The [[Eucharist]] (called [[Holy Communion]], or the Lord's Supper) is the part of liturgical worship that consists of a consecrated meal, usually bread and wine. Justin Martyr described the Eucharist:

{{quotation|And this food is called among us ''Eukaristia'' [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.|Justin Martyr&lt;ref name=justin/&gt;}}

Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

[[Image:Worship-team.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A modern Protestant worship band leading a contemporary worship session.]]
Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between &quot;[[High church|High]]&quot; [[church service]]s, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and &quot;[[Low church|Low]]&quot; services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak. Some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing, and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

=== Sacraments ===
{{Main|Sacrament}}
{{See also|Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Anglican sacraments|Lutheran sacraments}}

[[File:Fractio-panis1.JPG|right|thumb|230px|The [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]]]]

In Christian belief and practice, a '''sacrament''' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]], however, the majority of Christians recognize seven Sacraments or Divine Mysteries: Baptism, [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition), and the Eucharist, [[Holy Orders]], [[Confession (religion)|Reconciliation of a Penitent]] (confession), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Christian views of marriage|Matrimony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt; Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognised by churches in the [[High church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]] most [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt; Most Protestant [[Christian denominations]] who believe these rites do not communicate grace prefer to call them ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]''.

=== Liturgical calendar ===
{{Main|Liturgical year}}

Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a [[Liturgical year|liturgical calendar]]. This includes [[Holy Day of Obligation|holy days]], such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]. A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Christian symbolism}}
[[File:Groblje Sv. Marko2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Jesus on the Cross]]
[[File:Normandy American Cemetery.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Christian cemetery]]

The [[Christian cross|cross]], which is today one of the most widely recognised symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm |title=ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX).&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian, in his book ''De Corona'', tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.&quot; (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the [[crucifix]] did not appear in use until the 5th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;&gt;Dilasser. ''The Symbols of the Church''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'', meaning, ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savioufr''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot; /&gt;

Christians from the very beginning adorned their [[catacombs|tombs]] with paintings of Christ, of the saints, of scenes from the Bible and allegorical groups. The catacombs are the cradle of all Christian art. The first Christians had no prejudice against images, pictures, or statues. The idea that they must have feared the danger of [[Idolatry in Christianity|idolatry]] among their new converts is disproved in the simplest way by the pictures, even statues, that remain from the 1st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceimage&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Veneration of Images].&lt;/ref&gt; Other major Christian symbols include the [[Chi-Rho|chi-rho monogram]], the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolising the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;/&gt;

=== Baptism ===

[[Baptism]] is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly, on whether the act has any spiritual significance, some churches hold to the doctrine of [[Baptismal Regeneration]], which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person’s faith, and is intimately linked to salvation, this view is held by Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, while others simply acknowledge it as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods being: [[Immersion baptism|Baptism by Immersion]]; if immersion is total, Baptism by Submersion; and [[Affusion|Baptism by Affusion]] (pouring) and [[Aspersion|Baptism by Aspersion]] (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of [[Infant Baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission&quot; ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213]; &quot;Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God&quot; ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] &quot;Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ&quot; ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/overview_of_baptism.pdf An United Methodist Understanding of Baptism);]{{dead link|date=February 2012}} &quot;As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away&quot; ([http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm [[William H. Brackney]], Believer's Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prayer ===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity}}
Jesus' teaching on prayer in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged.{{bibleref2c|Mat.|6:5–15}} Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized.{{bibleref2c|Phil.|4:6}}{{bibleref2c|Jam.|5:13–19}} This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alexander, T. D., &amp; Rosner, B. S |year=2001 |title =Prayer |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Biblical Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasised, including medieval gestures such as [[genuflection]] or making the [[sign of the cross]]. [[Kneeling]], bowing and [[prostration]]s (see also [[poklon]]) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal [[commendation ceremony]]. At other times the older [[orans]] posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

''Intercessory prayer'' is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, included prayers of the [[Apostle Peter]] on behalf of sick persons{{bibleref2c|Acts|9:40}} and by [[prophet]]s of the Old Testament in favor of other people.{{bibleref2c|1Ki|17:19–22}} In the New Testament [[book of James]] no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah.{{bibleref2c|Jam|5:16–18}} The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;/&gt;

The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches. Churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |coauthors=Ferguson, S. B., &amp; Packer, J. |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was [[idolatry in Christianity|idolatrous]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]: &quot;Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/catechism/p4s1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Part Four – Christian Prayer |publisher=Va |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Common Prayer]] in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.

{{Main|Early Christianity|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}

Christianity began as a [[Jewish]] sect in the [[Levant]] of the middle east in the mid-1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Esler&quot;/&gt; Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the [[Twelve Apostles]], particularly [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle]], followed by the early [[bishop]]s, whom Christians consider the [[Apostolic Succession|successors of the Apostles]].

According to the scriptures, Christians were from the beginning subject to [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by some Jewish religious authorities, who disagreed with the apostles' teachings (See [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]). This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as [[Stephen]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:59}} and [[James, son of Zebedee]].{{bibleref2c|Acts|12:2}} Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire, first in the year 64, when [[Emperor Nero]] blamed them for the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that early Church leaders Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus]] were each martyred in Rome. Further widespread [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|persecutions]] of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]]. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[Patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen]]. However, [[Armenia]] is considered the first nation to accept Christianity in 301 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill|first=N.S.|title=Which Nation First Adopted Christianity?|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/neareast/f/1stchristian.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 October 2011|quote=&quot;Armenia is considered the first nation to have adopted Christianity as the state religion in a traditional date of c.

State persecution ceased in the 4th century, when [[Constantine I]] issued an [[Edict of Milan|edict of toleration]] in 313. On 27 February 380, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] enacted a law establishing [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] Christianity as the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2], in: Bettenson.

Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which sought to address the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]] and formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which is still used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglican Communion]], and many [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;/&gt; Nicaea was the first of a series of [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical (worldwide) Councils]] which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning [[Christology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners37&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 37f.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils, and are still separate today.

The presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st century in [[Egypt]], and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around [[Carthage]]. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity includes [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen of Alexandria]], [[Cyprian]], [[Athanasius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The later rise of [[Islam]] in [[North Africa]] reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving only the [[Coptic Church]] in Egypt and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The History of Christianity in Africa began in the 1st century when [[Mark the Evangelist]] started the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in about 43&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43&amp;nbsp;AD. &quot;Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity&quot; Otto F.A.

=== Early Middle Ages ===

With the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the [[papacy]] became a political player, first visible in [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]]'s diplomatic dealings with [[Attila the Hun|Huns]] and [[Vandals]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. Whilst arianists instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see [[Massacre of Verden]] as example), [[Catholicism]] also spread among the [[Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 238–42.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Slavic peoples]], the [[Hungarians]], and the [[Baltic peoples]]. Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of [[Western civilization]], at least since the 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge University Historical Series&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltron J.H Hayas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlandis&quot;/&gt;

Around 500, [[St. Benedict]] set out his [[Monastic Rule]], establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; [[Monasticism]] became a powerful force throughout Europe,&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Gaul]], contributing to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century.

In the 7th century [[Muslim conquests|Muslims conquered]] [[Syria]] (including [[Jerusalem]]), [[North Africa]] and [[Spain]]. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the [[Byzantine empire]] in its decades long conflict with [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of [[Carolingian]] leaders, the papacy began to find greater political support  in the [[Frankish Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, p. 93-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. [[Pope Gregory the Great]] dramatically reformed [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastical structure]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 244–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 8th century, [[iconoclasm]] became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperors. The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]] (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 278–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltron J.H Hayas&quot;&gt;Caltron J.H Hayas, ''Christianity and Western Civilization'' (1953),Stanford University Press, p.2: &quot;That certain distinctive features of our Western civilization — the civilization of western Europe and of America— have been shaped chiefly by Judaeo - Graeco - Christianity, Catholic and Protestant.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High and Late Middle Ages ===

[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]], where he preached the [[First Crusade]].]]
In the west, from the 11th century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris]], and [[University of Bologna]].) The traditional [[medieval universities]] — evolved from Catholic and Protestant church schools — then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as [[profession]]als. Prof. Walter Rüegg, editor of ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics, lawyers, civil servants, and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Rudy, ''The Universities of Europe, 1100-1914'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Originally teaching only [[theology]], these steadily added subjects including medicine, philosophy and law, becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 312, 314f..&lt;/ref&gt; 
The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, Walter: &quot;Foreword. The University as a European Institution&quot;, in: ''A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. XIX–XX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Verger|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): &quot;Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century&quot;, Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, ISBN 0-87249-376-8, pp. 126-7, 282-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the rise of the &quot;new towns&quot; throughout Europe, [[mendicant order]]s were founded, bringing the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the [[Franciscans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 310f., 316f.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[St. Dominic]] respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and the building of the great European cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 321–23, 365f.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1095 under the pontificate of [[Urban II]], the [[Crusades]] were launched.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 292–300.&lt;/ref&gt; These were a series of military campaigns in the [[Holy Land]] and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] for aid against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Riley-Smith. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a [[East-West Schism|schism]] dividing it into a so-called Latin or [[Western Christian]] branch, the Roman Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], largely Greek, branch, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical, and doctrinal issues, most notably [[papal primacy|papal primacy of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx| title = The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|publisher = Orthodox Information Centre|accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SandSp91&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various [[Eastern Catholic Churches|smaller eastern churches]].

Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against the [[Cathars|Cathar]] heresy,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 300, 304–05.&lt;/ref&gt; various institutions, broadly referred to as the [[Inquisition]], were established with the aim of suppressing [[heresy]] and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation ===

[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Opening of [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Luther's 95 Theses]]]]
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}

The 15th-century [[Renaissance]] brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], resulted in the splintering of the Western Christendom into several [[Christian denominations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 [[95 Theses|protested]] against the sale of [[indulgences]] and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic [[doctrine]]. Others like [[Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called [[Protestantism]], which repudiated the [[papal primacy|primacy of the pope]], the role of tradition, the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]], and other doctrines and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 39, 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] began in 1534, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had himself [[Act of Supremacy|declared head]] of the [[Church of England]]. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolved]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama&quot;&gt;Schama. ''A History of Britain''. pp. 306–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Torture Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Two priests demand a heretic to repent as he is tortured]]
Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] or Catholic Reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter242&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'', pp. 242–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon3&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 109–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Throughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe: [[Lutheranism]] in parts of Germany and in Scandinavia and [[Anglicanism]] in England in 1534. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples. These events intensified the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689''.&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity has played a role in shaping of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge University Historical Series&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltron J.H Hayas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst Hutter‏&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fred Reinhard Dallmayr‏&quot;/&gt;

=== Post-Enlightenment ===

[[File:View from Stpeters.jpg|center|900px|thumb|[[360-degree view]] from the dome over the Vatican and out into Rome]]
In the era known as the [[Great Divergence]], when in the West the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Scientific revolution]] brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]] such as versions of [[socialism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Michael|title=Catholic social thought and liberal institutions: Freedom with justice|year=1988|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-0-88738-763-0|page=63|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7pb1GDmxA1UC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events ranged from mere [[anti-clericalism]] to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|Dechristianisation]] during the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Civil War]], and general hostility of [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements, especially [[Russian Revolution (1917)|the Russian Revolution]].

Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of [[nation states]] after the [[Napoleonic era]]. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political, and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], and to some extent [[Austria]], religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in [[Poland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Switzerland]], all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and [[Italy]], countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20. Jahrhundert|year=2007|publisher=Kohlhammer|isbn=978-3-17-019977-4|pages=15–34|editor=Urs Altermatt, Franziska Metzger|accessdate=10 August 2010|language=[[German language{{!}}German]]|chapter=Katholizismus und Nation: Vier Modelle in europäisch-vergleichender Perspektive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined factors of the formation of nation states and [[ultramontanism]], especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in [[England]] (to a much lesser extent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heimann|first=Mary|title=Catholic Devotion in Victorian England|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-820597-X|pages=165–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;), often forced Catholic churches, organizations, and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the [[Kulturkampf]], where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.

Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | work=BBC News | title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says | date=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=図録▽世界各国の宗教 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general, with the [[western civilization]] no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity.

Some Europeans (including diaspora), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples' historical folk religions. (see [[Neo-paganism]], [[Native Americans in the United States#Religion]]) Approximately 7.1 to 10% of [[Arabs]] are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christians]]&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |doi= |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |author= ed. by Andrea Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.

These groups are sometimes classified under [[Christian denomination|denominations]], though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom ({{Clarify|date=August 2008}}, p. 381.) characterized [[denominationalism]] in America as &quot;a virtual ecclesiology&quot; that &quot;first of all repudiates the insistences of the Roman Catholic church, the churches of the 'magisterial' Reformation, and of most sects that they alone are the true Church.&quot; For specific citations, on the Roman Catholic Church see the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §816; other examples: Donald Nash, [http://www.crownhillchurch.com/Why_the_Churches_of_Christ_Are_Not_A_Denomination.pdf#search=%22church%20of%20christ%20not%20a%20denomination%22 Why the Churches of Christ are not a Denomination]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}; Wendell Winkler, [http://www.thebible.net/introchurch/ch4.html Christ's Church is not a Denomination]; and David E.

[[File:Christianity Branches.svg|659px|thumb|center|A simplified chart of historical developments of major groups within Christianity.  However, one should note that Christianity was never a unified movement.  There were many diverse Christian communities with wildly different Christologies, eschatologies, soteriologies, and cosmologies that existed alongside the &quot;Early Church&quot; which is itself a projected concept to indicate which communities were &quot;proto-orthodox,&quot; in that their views would become dominate.  In many ways, the first three centuries of Christianity was significantly more diverse than modern Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Bart D.|last=Ehrman|authorlink=Bart D.

[[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] comprises those churches in communion with the Patriarchal Sees of the East, such as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1199&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', p. 1199.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through [[Apostolic succession]] and has an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] structure, though the [[autocephaly|autonomy]] of the individual, mostly national churches is emphasized. A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity, with over 200&amp;nbsp;million adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|History of Protestantism}}
In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and [[John Calvin]] inaugurated what has come to be called [[Protestantism]]. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the [[Reformed|Reformed Tradition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners251&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 251–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Protestant traditions branch out from the Reformed tradition in some way. In addition to the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation, there is [[Anglicanism]] after the [[English Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history.

The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], followed in many cases by further divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners251&quot;/&gt; For example, the [[Methodist Church]] grew out of Anglican minister [[John Wesley]]'s [[Evangelism|evangelical]] and [[Holiness Movement|revival movement]] in the [[Anglican Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Methodist Central Hall Westminster—Methodism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.methodist-central-hall.org.uk/history/WhatisMethodism.htm| title = About The Methodist Church|publisher = Methodist Central Hall Westminster|accessdate = 2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Pentecostal]] and non-denominational Churches, which emphasize the cleansing power of the [[Holy Spirit]], in turn grew out of the Methodist Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;FYW—Pentecostalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.findingyourwayinc.org/christianity.htm| title = Christianity: Pentecostal Churches|publisher = Finding Your Way, Inc.|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Methodists, Pentecostals, and other [[evangelicals]] stress &quot;accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CUMC Accepting Christ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cambridgechristumc.com/statementofbelief.htm| title = Statement of Belief|publisher = Cambridge Christ United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from [[John Wesley]]'s emphasis of the [[New Birth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC GBGM-The New Birth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/45/| title = The New Birth by John Wesley (Sermon 45)|publisher = The United Methodist Church GBGM|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often refer to themselves as being [[Born again Christianity|born-again]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC GBGM-Grace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/wesley/walk.stm| title = God's Preparing, Accepting, and Sustaining Grace|publisher = The United Methodist Church GBGM|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren Wilson College—Total Experience of the Spirit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/christianity/index/pentecostal/essay.shtml| title = Total Experience of the Spirit|publisher = Warren Wilson College|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, partly because of the difficulty in determining which denominations should be placed in these categories, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism in number of followers (although the Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot; /&gt; Often that number is put at 800 million. Protestantism, along with the Orthodox Church (appx. 200 million) and the Catholic Church (appx. 1.1 billion) form a total of 2.1 billion Christianity followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/glossary/qt/Protestantism.htm |title=Protestantism - Definition of Protestantism |publisher=Christianity.about.com |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the [[Church of England]] and organised in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes/Booty/Knight. ''The Study of Anglicanism'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Anglicans consider their church a [[Branch theory|branch of the &quot;One Holy Catholic Church&quot;]] alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hallam, ''[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Mathewes-Green, &quot;[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]&quot;, ''Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim'' Vol. 2, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot; or &quot;[[born-again]] Christians&quot;. They typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and/or [[creed]]alism of other Christian communities&lt;ref&gt;Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to describe &quot;the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.&quot; (MacCulloch, ''The Reformation: A History'', p. xxiv.)&lt;/ref&gt; by calling themselves &quot;[[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]]&quot;. Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-appendix3.pdf |title = Classification of Protestant Denominations|publisher = Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|accessdate = 2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Trinitarian ===
{{Main|Non-Trinitarianism}}
[[Non-Trinitarianism]] includes all [[Christian]] [[Christian theology|belief systems]] that reject, wholly or partly, the [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]], namely, the teaching that God is three distinct yet coeternal and coequal ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]]'' who are indivisibly united in one essence.&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title =Do You Believe in a Devil? | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/doyoubelieve.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15047a.htm The dogma of the Trinity]'' at 'Catholic Encyclopedia', ed. Kevin Knight at New Advent website&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, sporadically in the Middle Ages, and again following the Reformation until today, differing views existed concerning the Godhead from those of Trinitarians and the related traditional [[Christology]]. Though diverse, these views may be generally classified into those that hold Christ to be only divine and not differing from the Father [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostatically]]; those that hold Christ to be less fully God than the Father; in other forms being completely human and a messenger as the perfect created human.&lt;ref&gt;John 6:14 Jesus identified as a prophet. The greater Moses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Unitarians, see: UUA.org, [http://www.uua.org/re/reach/fall01/curriculum/unitarian_views_of_jesus.html ''Unitarian Views of Jesus'']; on connection with Socinianism, see: sullivan-county.com, [http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2000/unitarian1.htm ''Socinianism: Unitarianism in 16th-17th century Poland and Its Influence''] (Note that the icon at the top of the page expresses Trinitarian theology with a symbolic hand gesture); on this matter they parallel the ancient [[Ebionites]], see: J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'' pp. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Esoteric Christianity}}
'''Esoteric Christianity''' is a term which refers to an ensemble of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] currents which regard Christianity as a [[Western esotericism|mystery religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion: Selected Papers Presented at the 17th Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Besant 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Besant | first = Annie | title = Esoteric Christianity or the Lesser Mysteries | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | location = City | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-4021-0029-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and profess the existence and possession of certain [[Esotericism|esoteric]] doctrines or practices,&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek ἐσωτερικός (esôterikos, &quot;inner&quot;). The term [[esotericism]] itself was coined in the 17th century. (Oxford English Dictionary Compact Edition, Volume 1,Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 894.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Antoine Faivre, Roelof van den Broek, Jean-Pierre Brach, Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism, Brill 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of &quot;enlightened&quot;, &quot;initiated&quot;, or highly educated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/esotericism |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: esotericism |publisher=Webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/esoteric |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: esoteric |publisher=Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special characteristic common in these mystical denominations is the belief in  [[reincarnation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
Some of the esoteric Christian institutions include the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], the [[Anthroposophical Society]] and the [[Martinism]].

The [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival that occurred in the [[United States|U.S.]] during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of [[Jesus Christ]] rather than reforming one of the existing churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 91f.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the [[Great Apostasy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Religious Tolerance—Restorationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/chrrest.htm| title = The Restorationist Movements|publisher = Religious Tolerance|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Got Questions Ministries—Restorationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/restorationism.html| title = What is Restorationism?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early-19th century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventist|Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement (with 7&amp;nbsp;million members),&lt;ref&gt;JW-Media.org [http://www.jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm#Jehovah%Witness%Membership%2005 Membership 2005]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. Others, including the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]], which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the [[Christadelphians]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest denomination of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] with over 14 million members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Statistics|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=14 June 2012}} The Church counts all members who were ever baptized, who have neither been excommunicated nor asked to have their names removed from church records. Independent surveys estimate that about 50% of people on LDS Church rolls do not identify with the religion. See John Dart, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_17_124/ai_n20525201/ Counting Mormons: study says LDS numbers inflated]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}, Christian Century, August 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

=== Cultural Christian ===

[[Cultural Christian]] is a broad term used to describe people with either ethnic or religious [[Christian]] heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the [[Christian pop culture|culture]], [[Christian art|art]], [[Christian music|music]], and so on related to it.

Many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians, due to the predominance of the Christian faith in [[Western culture]], as well as widely celebrated religious holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.

=== Western Culture ===
Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|coauthors=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman empires]], as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the [[Catholic Church]] was the only consistent force in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=9780884892984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=The Age of Enlightenment|isbn=9780884892984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|coauthors=Glenn Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecumenism ==
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
[[File:ChristianFlagEtc CovenantPresbyterianLongBeach20050213 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Christian Flag]] displayed next to the [[pulpit]] on the [[chancel]] of a church sanctuary.]]
Most [[Church body|churches]] have long expressed ideals of being reconciled with each other, and in the 20th century Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 581–84.&lt;/ref&gt; One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] which includes Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;/&gt;

The other way was institutional union with new [[United and uniting churches]]. [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian]] churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 413f.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and [[Reformed Church|Reformed]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission]] (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]] and Roman Catholic churches signing The [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation. In 2006, the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist church]] adopted the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranworld.org/What_We_Do/OEA/Methodist-Statement-2006-EN.pdf |title=Methodist Statement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of ecumenism is the invention of and growing usage of the [[Christian Flag]], which was designed to represent all of [[Christendom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prayer Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prayerfoundation.org/christian_flag.htm|title =The Christian Flag|publisher = Prayer Foundation|quote=The flag's most conspicuous symbol is the Christian cross, the most universal symbol for Christianity. The red color represents the blood of Christ and brings to mind his crucifixion.  Christians believe that Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is the means God uses to save believers from their sins. The cross and blood have been used since earliest Christianity to symbolize salvation through Jesus; in the words of the Apostle Paul, &quot;And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself;&quot; -Colossians 1:20. The white field draws on symbolism throughout the Bible equating white clothes with purity and forgiveness.  People who have been &quot;washed white as snow&quot; in the Bible have been cleansed from their sins (Isaiah 1:18; Psalm 51:2).  In conventional vexillology (the study of flags, their history and sybolism), a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description Jesus' non-violence and surrender to God's will. The symbolism behind the blue canton has been interpreted to represent Heaven, truth, or the Christian ritual of Baptism in water.|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag has a white [[flag terminology|field]], with a red [[Latin cross]] inside a blue [[flag terminology|canton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prayer Foundation&quot;/&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Main|Criticism of Christianity}}
Criticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the [[Apostolic age]], with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the [[Pharisees]] and [[scribes]] (e.g. Mark 7:1-23 and Matthew 15:1-20).&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 ISBN 0802837824 page 175&lt;/ref&gt; In the second century Christianity was criticized by the Jews on a various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the [[Hebrew Bible]] could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'' by James D. G. Dunn 1999 ISBN 0802844987 pages 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; By the third century criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it, and the 15 volume ''Adversus Christianos'' by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] was written as a comprehensive attack on Christianity, in part building on the pre-Christian concepts of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 1'' by George Thomas Kurian and James Smith 2010 ISBN 081086987X page 527&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Apologetic Discourse and the Scribal Tradition'' by Wayne Campbell Kannaday 2005 ISBN 9004130853 pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (i.e., [[Rabbi]] [[Moses Maimonides]]) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus who had a physical body.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary Of Jewish-Christian Relations'' by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005 ISBN 0521826926 page 168&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Nietzsche]] began to write a series of attacks on the &quot;unnatural&quot; teachings of Christianity (e.g. avoidance of temptations), and continued anti-Christian attacks to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'' by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996 ISBN 0521367670 pages 90-93&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his criticism of Christianity in ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999 ISBN 0415180910 pages 77-87&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] theologians criticize the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three Gods, running against the basic tenet of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity: An Introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 ISBN 1405108991 pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;
