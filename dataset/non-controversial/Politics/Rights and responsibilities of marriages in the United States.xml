      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8084">According to the [[United States]] [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), there are 1,138&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf 2004 updated report of the GAO [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]&lt;/ref&gt; statutory provisions in which marital status is a factor in determining benefits, rights, and privileges. These rights and responsibilities apply to only [[male]]-[[female]] couples, from the 1996 [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

Prior to the enactment of DOMA, the [[General Accounting Office]] (as the GAO was then called) identified 1,049&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/og97016.pdf General Accounting Office's 1997 report [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]&lt;/ref&gt; federal statutory provisions in which benefits, rights, and privileges are contingent on [[marital status]] or in which marital status is a factor.  An update was published in 2004 by the GAO covering the period between September 21, 1996 (when DOMA was signed into law) and December 31, 2003.  The update identified 120 new statutory provisions involving [[marriage|marital]] status, and 31 statutory provisions involving marital status repealed or amended in such a way as to eliminate marital status as a factor.  

See below for a partial list of these provisions of federal law.

* [[Marriage penalty]]/bonus
* Someone cannot change beneficiaries in a retirement plan or from waiving the joint and survivor annuity form of retirement benefit, without the written consent of his or her spouse
* Wages can be garnished at a maximum of 60% (instead of the normal 25% limit) if the garnishing is for [[alimony]] or [[child support]]

== States ==
In addition, community-property states frequently have forms of ownership that allow a full basis step-up on one's own share of [[community property]] on the death of a spouse (in addition to the normal step-up on spouse's assets).

==Legal remedies enacted following the GAO report==
Following the 2004 GAO report at least one bill, the [[Uniting American Families Act]], has been proposed to attempt to remedy some of the differences in rights between same-sex partnerships and marriages.
