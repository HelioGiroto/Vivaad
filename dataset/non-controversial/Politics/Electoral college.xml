An '''electoral college''' is a set of [[Voting|elector]]s who are selected to elect a [[candidate]] to a particular office. Often these represent different organizations or [[entity|entities]], with each organization or entity represented by a particular number of electors or with [[vote]]s weighted in a particular way. Many times, though, the electors are simply important people whose [[wisdom]] would ideally provide a better choice than a larger body. The system can ignore the wishes of a general membership.

==Origins of electoral colleges==
[[Early Germanic law]] stated that the German king led only with the support of his nobles.  Thus, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]] needed to be elected by his [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] nobles before becoming king of [[Asturias]], and so did [[Pepin the Short]] by Frankish nobles in order to become the first Carolingian king.  While most other Germanic nations had developed a strictly hereditary system by the end of the first millennium, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] did not, and the King of the Romans, who would become Holy Roman Emperor or at least Emperor-elect, was selected by the college of [[prince-elector]]s from the [[late Middle Ages]] until 1806 (the last [[Imperial election|election]] actually took place in 1792).

[[Christian Church|Church]], both the clergy and [[laity]], elected the bishop or presiding [[presbyter]]. However, for various reasons, such as, perhaps, a desire to reduce the influence of the state or the laity in ecclesiastical matters, electoral power became restricted to the clergy and, in the case of the Church in the West, exclusively to a college of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the cathedral church. In the Pope's case, the system of people and clergy was eventually replaced by a college of the important clergy of Rome, which eventually became known as the [[College of Cardinals]]. Since 1059, it has had exclusive authority over papal selection.

In the 19th century and beyond, it was usual in many countries that voters did not directly vote the members of parliament. In [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] for example, in 1849–1918 the voters were ''Urwähler'' (original voters), appointing with their vote a ''Wahlmann'' (elector). The group of electors in a district elected the deputy for the Prussian [[Prussian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Such [[indirect election|indirect suffrage]] was a means to steer the voting, to make sure that the electors were &quot;able&quot; persons. For electors, the requirements were usually higher than for the original voters. The left wing opposition was very much opposed against the indirect suffrage, although 

Even today in the Netherlands, the deputies of the First Chamber are elected by the provincial parliaments. Those provincial parliaments form the electoral colleges for the First Chamber elections; the lists of candidates are national.

==Modern electoral colleges==

Countries with complex regional electorates may elect a [[head of state]] by means of an electoral college rather than a [[direct election|direct popular election]]. The United States is the only current example of an [[indirectly elected]] [[executive president]], with an [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] comprising electors representing the [[US states|50 states]] and the [[federal district]]. Each state has a number of electors equal to its Congressional representation (in both houses), with the non-state [[District of Columbia]] receiving three electors and other non-state territories having no electors. The electors generally cast their votes for the winner of the popular vote in their respective states. However, there are several states where this is not required by law. In the United States, 270 electoral votes are required to win the presidential election.

Similar systems are used or have been used in other presidential elections around the world. The [[President of Finland]] was elected by an electoral college between 1919 and 1987. In Germany the members of the federal parliament together with an equal number of people elected from the state parliaments constitute the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]], that exists for the only purpose of electing the (non-executive) head of state. Similarly, in India the members of the lower house of Parliament together with weighted votes from the state parliaments elect the head of state. In Italy the presidential electoral college is composed of the members of both houses of Parliament and three members elected by each of the regional assemblies.

During [[Brazil]]'s military rule period, the president was elected by an electoral college comprising senators, deputies, state deputies, and lawmakers in the cities. [[Argentina]] had an electoral college established by its original 1853 constitution, which was used to elect its president during that country's periods of democracy. The constitution was reformed in 1994 and the electoral college was replaced with a direct election by popular vote with [[Two-round system|runoff round]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Other countries with electoral college systems include [[Burundi]], Estonia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/constitution.php?gid=81910 Constitution of Estonia, section 79] – retrieved on 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/Art1-242%20(1-88).doc Constitution of India, articles 54 and 66] – retrieved on 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; France (for the [[French Senate]]), the [[Republic of Ireland]] (for [[Seanad Éireann]]), [[Kazakhstan]], Madagascar, [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Pakistan]], Trinidad and Tobago &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttparliament.org/Docs/constitution/ttconst.pdf Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago, section 28] – retrieved on 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanuatu]]. Within China, both [[Macau]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and Hong Kong each have an [[Election Committee]] which functions as an electoral college for selecting the Chief Executive and formerly (in the case of Hong Kong) for selecting some of the seats of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]].

Another type of Electoral College is used by the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] to choose its leader.  The college consists of three equally weighted sections: the votes of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s; the votes of [[affiliated trade union]]s and [[socialist societies]]; and the votes of individual members of [[Constituency Labour Parties]].&lt;ref&gt;Labour Party Rule Book rule 4B.2c – quoted in [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03938.pdf House of Commons Research Note SN/PC/3938: Labour Party Leadership Elections] retrieved 6 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecclesiastic]]al electoral colleges abound in modern times, especially among Protestant and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]]. In the Eastern rite churches, all the bishops of an [[autocephalous]] church elect successor bishops, thus serving as an electoral college for all the [[episcopal see]]s.
