'''Authority''' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[auctoritas]]'') is a [[rights|right]] conferred by recognized [[social position]]. Authority often refers to [[Power (politics)|power]] vested in an [[individual]] or [[organization]] by the [[State (polity)|state]].  Authority can also refer to recognized [[expert|expertise]] in an area of academic knowledge.  An Authority (capitalized) refers to a governing body upon which certain authority (with lower case ''a'') is vested.

==Authority in various settings==
===Politics===
In [[government]], authority is the scope of an entity's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] power (Cline n.d.) when acting on behalf of the government.  This power is conferred through officially recognized channels within the government, and represents a portion of the government's overall power.  For example, a government might have the authority to execute criminals.  The government could then contain a jury authorized to determine if a citizen is a criminal or a non-criminal; a judge authorized to sentence criminals to execution; and an executioner authorized to kill criminals who have been sentenced to execution.  In contrast, a mob of citizens might have the power to do all of the above things, but still lack the authority because the actions would not be legitimate.

Political authority can also be seen in situations that are typically considered apolitical. (Agarwal n.d.)  In truth bestowing authority is a function of any [[social institution]].  A corporation, for example, must hire employees as a standard function of its existence.  However, most of the corporation's members are not authorized to hire employees.  This authority is passed down through the corporation to specific individuals without government involvement.  This same phenomenon can be found in religious organizations, charities, fraternities, etc.

===Religion===
Recognizing when God has indicated His will requires the ability to understand how authority is expressed by a higher power. Direct statements and commands are most easily recognized as expressed authority. Seeing an example of someone acting in a way that meets with approval is helpful. Oftentimes, directions from the author require some inferring as the author implies what is required.

===Philosophy===
One should distinguish between power and authority. Both are involved with the use of agreement, power can relate to an armed criminal while authority may relate to a wise guru. The guru has authority but no power, while a criminal has power but no authority.  If a military force loses their control, then they will lose authority.&lt;ref&gt; A. H Lesser. Journal of Medical Ethics; Analysis: An Introduction to Ethical Concepts. (1975). 193&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Academia===
A person (or group) could be considered an &quot;authority&quot; on a subject matter if their expertise is well established.  This means that any statements the person makes, with regard to their field of expertise, will have the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] in their favor.  That is, if a professor of [[mathematics]] makes a statement about numbers, it will be assumed to be true in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  This will also overrule any unsupported objections by an individual without such expertise.  Professional scholars are common examples of this, but they are not the only examples.  A carpenter might be considered an authority on wood, for example.

===Governmental agencies===
Every state has a number of institutions which exercise authority based on longstanding practices.  Apart from this, every state sets up agencies which are competent in dealing with one particular matter. All this is set up within its charter. One example would be a [[port authority]] like the [[Port of London]]. They are usually created by special legislation and are run by a [[board of directors]]. Several agencies and institutions are created along the same lines and they exercise authority in certain matters. They are usually required to support themselves through [[property tax]]es or other forms of collection or fees for services.

===Psychology===
The [[Milgram experiment]] of 1961 demonstrated that people will follow an authority figure regardless of consequent effects on other people. Participants followed the orders of experimenters who represented the authority, and continued to give electric shocks to the learner who gave wrong answers to questions, even though the participants themselves were not required to administer the shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Heth|title=Psychology the Science od Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Social Psychology|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;
