'''Debeaking''', also called '''beak trimming''' is the partial removal of the [[beak]] of [[poultry]], especially [[chicken|layer hens]] and [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] although it may also be performed on [[quail]] and [[ducks]]. Most commonly, the beak is shortened permanently, although regrowth can occur. The trimmed lower beak is somewhat longer than the upper beak. USA's [[United Egg Producers|UEP]] guidelines suggest that in egg laying strains of chickens, the length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils which remains following trimming, should be 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;United Egg Producers Animal Husbandry Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] stated ''&quot;The accepted procedure is to remove not more than one third of the upper and lower beaks or not more than one third of the upper beak only&quot;'' but then went on to recommend ''&quot;Where beak trimming is carried out, it should, wherever possible, be restricted to beak tipping; that is the blunting of the beak to remove the sharp point which can be the cause of the most severe damage to other birds.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/pdf/beak-trimming.pdf|title=FAWC opinion on beak trimming, 2007|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term &quot;debeaking&quot; implies that the entire beak is removed during the trimming process, though in reality only half or less of the beak is removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glatz, (2005)&quot;&gt;Glatz, P.C., (2005). ''Poultry Welfare Issues: Beak Trimming.'' Nottingham University Press, Nottingham, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beak trimming is most common in egg-laying strains of chickens.  In some countries such as the United States, turkeys are routinely beak trimmed, however, in the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAWC turkeys&quot;&gt;[http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/turkeys/turkr025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimming is a preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as [[Cannibalism (poultry)|cannibalism]], [[feather pecking]] and [[vent pecking]], and thereby improve livability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)&quot; /&gt;  Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins.  However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent damage during mating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentle and McKeegan, (2007)&quot;&gt;Gentle, M.J. and McKeegan, D.E.F., (2007). Evaluation of the effects of infrared beak trimming in broiler breeder chicks. Veterinary Record, 160: 145–148&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, beak trimming is done as a last resort where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate.  Beak trimming has been banned in Switzerland since 1992.

In close confinement, [[Cannibalism (birds)|cannibalism]], feather pecking and aggression are common among turkeys, [[duck]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[quail]], and egg laying strains of chickens of many breeds (including both heritage breeds and modern [[Sex link|hybrids]]). The tendency to cannibalism and feather pecking varies among different strains of chickens, but does not manifest itself consistently. Some flocks of the same breed may be entirely free from cannibalism, while others, under the same management, may have a serious outbreak.  Mortalities mainly due to cannibalism can be up to 15% in egg laying flocks housed in aviaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, (1986)&quot;&gt;Hill, J.A., (1986). Egg production in alternative systems - a review of recent research in the UK. Research and Development in Agriculture, 3:13-18&lt;/ref&gt; straw yards,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson et al., (1988)&quot;&gt;Gibson, S.W., Dun, P. and Hughes, B.O., (1988). The performance and behaviour of laying fowls in a covered strawyard system.  Research and Development in Agriculture, 5: 153-163&lt;/ref&gt; and free-range systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeling et al., (1988)&quot;&gt;Keeling, L.J., Hughes, B.O. and Dun P., (1988). Performance of free range laying hens in a polythene house and their behaviour on range. Farm Building Progress, 94:21-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because egg laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in caged systems, cannibalism is reduced &lt;ref name=&quot;Appleby and Hughes, (1991)&quot;&gt;Appleby, M.C. and Hughes B.O., (1991). Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects. World's Poultry Science Journal, 47: 109-128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrahamsson and Tauson, (1995)&quot;&gt;Abrahamsson, P. and Tauson, R. (1995). Aviary systems and conventional cages for laying hens - effects on production, egg quality, health and bird location in 3 hybrids.  Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica Section A-Animal Science,  45: 191-203&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems.  Cannibalism among flocks is highly variable and when it is not problematic, then mortalities among production systems are similar. &lt;ref name=&quot;Appleby and Hughes, (1991)&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
Beak trimming was developed at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennard, (1937)&quot;&gt;Kennard, D.C. (1937). ''Chicken vices'' Bimonthly Bullentin. 184. Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station. 22:33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original form was temporary, cutting approximately 1/4&quot; off the beak. It was thought that the tip of the beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.

Cannibalism is a serious management problem dating back to the periods before intensive housing of poultry became popular. Poultry books written before [[corporate farming|vertical integration of the poultry industry]] describe the vices of poultry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chicks and adult birds' picking at each other until blood shows and then destroying one another by further picking is a source of great loss in many flocks, especially when kept in confinement .... The recommendation of the Ohio Experiment Station of cutting back the tip of the upper beak has been found to be effective until the beak grows out again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jull, (1938)&quot;&gt;Jull, M.A., (1938). ''Poultry Husbandry'', 2nd Edition. McGraw Hill, New York., page 346.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cannibalism has two peaks in the life of a chicken; during the brooding period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets most of the attention. The temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be adequate.

===Current methods (2011)===
In recent years, the aim has been to develop more permanent beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using  electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut.  There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including [[scissors]] or [[secateurs]]), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and [[infrared]].  The latter two methods usually remove only the tip of the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches such as the use of lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/beak_trimming_bgnd.pdf|title= AVMA beaktrimming|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips.  The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glatz, (2005)&quot; /&gt;  The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate; and that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for the turkeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAWC turkeys&quot;/&gt;

In the UK, beak trimming of layer hens normally occurs at 1-day of age as the chick is being sexed and vaccinated.  

==Costs and benefits of beak trimming==
===Costs===
The costs of beak trimming relate primarily to welfare concerns.  These include acute stress, and acute,  possibly chronic, [[pain]] following trimming. A bird’s ability to consume feed is impaired following beak trimming because of the new beak shape and pain.  Most studies report reduced body weights and feed intake following beak trimming, however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)&quot;&gt;Hester, P.Y. and Shea-Moore, M., (2003). Beak trimming egg-laying strains of chickens. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 59:458-474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gustafson et al., (2007)&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagana et al., (2011)&quot; /&gt;  Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchant-Forde and Cheng, (2011)&quot;&gt;Marchant-Forde, R.M. and Cheng, H.W., (2011). Different effects of infrared and one-half hot blade beak trimming on beak topography and growth.  Poultry Science, 89: 2559-2564. {{doi|10.3382/ps.2010-00890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The pain of beak trimming====
[[File:ChickBeingDebeaked.jpg|thumb|A chick being beak-trimmed without anesthetics, by the use of a heated blade.]] 
Whether beak trimming causes pain is a hotly debated concern.  It is a complex issue as it may involve acute and/or chronic pain, and depends on the age it is performed, the method of trimming and the length of beak that is removed.
Beak trimming in the poultry industry usually occurs without [[anaesthetic]] at 1-day of age or when the chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated occasions.

===== Acute pain =====
The beak is a complex, functional organ with an extensive nervous supply including [[nociceptors]] that sense pain and noxious stimuli.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breward, (1984)&quot;&gt;Breward, J., (1984).  Cutaneous nociceptors in the chicken beak. Proceedings of the Journal of Physiology, London 346: 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentle, (1992)&quot;&gt;Gentle, M.J., (1992). Pain in birds. Animal Welfare, 1:235-247&lt;/ref&gt;  These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentle et al., (1982)&quot;&gt;Gentle M.J., Hughes B.O. and Hubrecht R.C., (1982). The effect of beak-trimming on food-intake, feeding behaviour and body weight in adult hens. Applied Animal Ethology, 8: 147–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan et al., (1989)&quot;&gt;Duncan I.J.H., Slee G.S., Seawright E. and Breward J., (1989). Behavioural consequences of partial beak amputation (beak trimming) in poultry. British Poultry Science, 30: 479–488&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentle et al., (1991)&quot;&gt;Gentle M.J., Hunter L.N. and Waddington D., (1991). The onset of pain related behaviours following partial beak amputation in the chicken. Neuroscience Letters, 128: 113–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Gentle et al., (1997)&quot;&gt;Gentle, M.J., Hughes, B.O., Fox, A. and Waddington, D., (1997). Behavioural and anatomical consequences of two beak trimming methods in 1- and 10-d-old domestic chicks. British Poultry Science, 38: 453-463&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Japanese quail]], beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lagana et al., (2011)&quot;&gt;Lagana, C., Pizzolante, C.C., Togashi, C.K., Kakimoto, S.K., Saldanha, E.S.P.B. and Alvares, V., (2011).  Beak trimming method and drinking system and their effect on the performance and egg quality of japanese quails. Revista Brasileira De Zootecnia-Brazilian Journal Of Animal Science, 40: 1217-1221&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimmed [[Muscovy ducks]] spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gustafson et al., (2007)&quot;&gt;Gustafson, L.A., Cheng, H.W., Garner, J.P., Pajor, E.A. and Mench, J.A., (2007). Effects of bill-trimming Muscovy ducks on behavior, body weight gain, and bill morphopathology.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 103: 59-74&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes and Gentle, (1995)&quot;&gt;Hughes, B.O. and Gentle, M.J., (1995). Beak trimming in poultry: Its implications for welfare. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 51: 51–61&lt;/ref&gt;  Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens&lt;ref name=&quot;Freire et al., (2008)&quot;&gt;Freire, R., Glatz, P. and Hinch, G., (2008). Self-administration of an analgesic does not alleviate pain in beak trimmed chickens. Asian-australas. Journal of Animal Science, 21: 443–448&lt;/ref&gt; possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friere et al., (2011)&quot;&gt;Freire, R., Eastwood, M.A. and Joyce, M., (2011).  Minor beak trimming in chickens leads to loss of mechanoreception and magnetoreception.  Journal Animal Science, 89: 1201-1206&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chronic pain=====
Severe beak trimming, or beak trimming birds at an older age, may cause chronic pain.  Following beak trimming of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show abnormal patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breward, (1984)&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breward, (1985)&quot;&gt;Breward, J., (1985). ''An electrophysiological investigation of the effects of beak trimming in the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus).''

World’s Poultry Science Journal, 42: 268-275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breward and Gentle, (1985)&quot;&gt;Breward, L. and Gentle, M.J., (1985).

Pain Syndromes in Neurology., edited by H.L. Fields, Butterworths, London, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the healed stumps of birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunam et al., (1996)&quot;&gt;Lunam, C.A., Glatz, P.C. and Hsu, Y-J., (1996).

Australian Veterinary Journal, 74: 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuromas have been associated with [[phantom pain]] in human amputees and have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds.  If beak trimming is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience [[chronic pain]], although this has been debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuenzel, (2007)&quot;&gt;Kuenzel, W.J. (2001).  Neurobiological basis of sensory perception: welfare implications of beak trimming. Poult. Sci., 86: 1273-1282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
{{Main|Feather pecking}}
The benefits of beak trimming relate to welfare advantages, some of which directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production.  These include reduced feather pecking and cannibalism, better feather condition, less fearfulness and nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambton et al., (2010)&quot;&gt;Lambton, S.L., Knowles, T.G., Yorke, C. and Nicol, C.J., (2010).  The risk factors affecting the development of gentle and severe feather pecking in loose housed laying hens.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 123: 32–42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to beak trimming==
A range of options have been proposed as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, as simple objects hung in a habitat can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to [[Vent pecking|cloacal cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Glatz, (2005)&quot; /&gt;
