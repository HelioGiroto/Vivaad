{{History of France}}
{{Governments of France}}

During the [[French Revolution]], the '''National Convention''' or '''Convention''', in France, comprised the constitutional and legislative [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] which sat from 20 September 1792 to 26 October 1795 (the 4th of Brumaire of the year IV under the [[French Republican Calendar]] adopted by the Convention). It held [[executive power]] in France during the first years of the [[French First Republic]]. It was succeeded by the [[French Directory|Directory]], commencing 2 November 1795. Prominent members of the original Convention included &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Maximilien Robespierre]]&lt;/span&gt; of the [[Jacobin Club]], &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Jean-Paul Marat]]&lt;/span&gt; (affiliated with the Jacobins, though never a formal member), and &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Georges Danton]]&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Cordeliers]]&lt;/span&gt;. From 1793 to 1794, executive power was ''de facto'' exercised by the Convention's [[Committee of Public Safety]].

France, like the rest of Europe, has never again used an elected [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to draft its constitutions, instead relying on the executive or legislative branches to draft successive constitutions before usually (but not always) submitting them to the electorate for approval in referendums.

== Formation ==

During [[10 August (French Revolution)|the insurrection]] of 10 August 1792, when the populace of Paris stormed the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Tuileries]]&lt;/span&gt; and demanded the abolition of the monarchy, the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] decreed the provisional suspension of King &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]&lt;/span&gt; and the convocation of a &quot;national convention&quot; which should draw up a constitution. At the same time it was decided that deputies to that [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] should be elected by all Frenchmen 25 years old or more, domiciled for a year and living by the product of their labor. The National Convention was therefore the first French assembly elected by universal male suffrage, without distinctions of class. The age limit of the electors was further lowered to 21, and that of eligibility was fixed at 25 years.

The first session was held 20 September 1792. The following day, the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|French monarchy was abolished]]. A little over a year later, 22 September would become the base date of the new [[French Revolutionary Calendar]], the beginning of the [[Year One|Year I]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture13a.html The Stage, 1792–1794]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary government ==
The Convention lasted for three years and came after the National Assembly and Legislative Assembly. [[French Revolutionary Wars|The country was at war]], and it seemed best to postpone the implementation of the new constitution until peace should be concluded. At the same time, as the Convention prolonged its powers, it extended them considerably in order to meet the pressing dangers which menaced the Republic. 

Although it was a legislative assembly, it took over the [[executive branch|executive power]], entrusting it to its own members. This &quot;confusion of powers&quot;, contrary to the philosophical theories – those of &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]&lt;/span&gt; especially – which had inspired the Revolution at first, was one of the essential characteristics of the Convention. The series of exceptional measures by which that confusion of powers was created constitutes the &quot;Revolutionary government&quot; in the strict sense of the word, a government which was principally in vigour during the [[Reign of Terror]]. There is thus a distinction to be made, discussing the Convention, between these temporary expedients and those measures intended to be permanent.

The first years of the Convention were the height of the importance of the revolutionary political clubs such as the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Jacobins&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Cordeliers&lt;/span&gt;; the informally constituted &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Girondist]]s&lt;/span&gt;, although past the peak of their power, were also an important factor. By the end of the Convention, most prominent members of all of these groups were dead, the bulk of them victims either of the Terror or of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] that brought the Terror to an end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/67/1004.html The National Convention: The Revolution's Most Radical Phase. 2001. The Encyclopedia of World History]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and membership ==
The Convention held its first session in a hall of the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Tuileries&lt;/span&gt;, then it sat in the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Salle du Manège]]&lt;/span&gt;, and finally from 10 May 1793 in that of the [[Hall of Spectacles|Spectacles]] (or Machine), an immense hall in which the deputies were but loosely scattered. This last hall had [[tribune]]s for the public, who often influenced the debate by interruptions or by applause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/natcon.html The National Convention] 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Convention came from all classes of society, but the most numerous were lawyers. Seventy-five members had sat in the [[National Constituent Assembly]], 183 in the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. The full number of deputies was 749, not counting 33 from the colonies, of whom only some arrived in Paris. Besides these, however, the newly formed &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''[[département in France|départements]]''&lt;/span&gt; annexed to France from 1792 to 1795 were allowed to send deputations. Many of the original deputies died or were exiled during the Convention, but not all their places were filled by &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''suppléants''&lt;/span&gt;. Some members proscribed during the Terror returned after the legislative coup of 9 &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Thermidor&lt;/span&gt; began the Thermidorian Reaction. Finally, many members were sent away, either to the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''départments''&lt;/span&gt; or to the armies, on missions which lasted sometimes for a considerable length of time. For all these reasons it is difficult to find out the number of deputies present at any given date, for votes by roll-call were rare. During the Terror the number of those voting averaged only 250.

According to its own ruling, the Convention elected its president every fortnight. He was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative the Convention used [[committee]]s, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws. The most famous of these committees included the [[Committee of Public Safety]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''Comité de salut public''&lt;/span&gt;), the [[Committee of General Security]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''Comité de sûreté générale''&lt;/span&gt;), and the [[Committee of Education]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''Comité de l’instruction''&lt;/span&gt;).

== Legacy ==
The article on the Convention in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] concludes, &quot;The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (''Museum'', &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''[[École Polytechnique]]''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''[[École Normale Supérieure]]''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''[[École des langues orientales]]''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''[[Conservatoire]]''&lt;/span&gt;), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;''Grand Livre de la Dette publique''&lt;/span&gt;, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.&quot; By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluviôse) it also ratified and expanded to the whole [[French colonial empire]] the 1793 [[abolition of slavery]] on [[Saint-Domingue]] by civil commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax|Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel|Polverel]], though this did not affect [[Martinique]] or [[Guadeloupe]] and was abolished by the [[law of 20 May 1802]].
