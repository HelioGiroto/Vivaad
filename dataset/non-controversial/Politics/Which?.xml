'''''Which?''''' is a product-testing and consumer campaigning [[Charitable organization|charity]] with a [[magazine]], [[website]] and various other services run by Which? Ltd (also known as the '''Consumers' Association''', still the official name of the charity). 

Based in the United Kingdom, it engages in [[advocacy]] campaigns on various [[consumer protection]] issues and aims to promote informed [[consumer]] choice in the purchase of goods and services, by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of [[consumer rights]] and offering independent advice. 

The organisation exists to make individuals as powerful as the organisations they have to deal with in their daily lives and maintains its independence by not accepting advertising or freebies. ''Which?'' receives no government funding.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/who-we-are/overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of ''Which?'s'' income comes from subscriptions to its products and services. Profits are used to fund advocacy activity and inform the public on consumer issues.

In the past, ''Which?'' used prize draws - similar to ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' - to gain additional subscribers, but following some criticism of this method, the organisation discontinued prize draws in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Which? annual report 2004-2005 http://www.which.co.uk/documents/pdf/annual-report-2004-2005-111742.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New subscribers are attracted via free mini-guides and trial offers.

''Which?'' also holds legislative powers to take action on behalf of consumers, including the ability to bring a [[super-complaint]] to the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT), a power first used to call for an investigation into private dentistry in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/super-complaints/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, ''Which?'' is the largest [[consumer organisation]] in the UK, with over 1.2 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Which? annual report 2009-2010 http://www.which.co.uk/documents/pdf/annual-report-2009-2010-233892.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and background ==

'''1950s: beginnings'''

The organisation was set up in 1957 as a response to the changing values and concerns of the post-war era, at a time of rapid changes in product markets and consumer behaviour - and a corresponding growth in sharp trading practices. 

To combat this, [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]], research director for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], proposed setting up a 'Consumer Advisory Service' to be considered for the party's 1950 manifesto, only to be rejected by [[Harold Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7029593.stm|title=Which? The Golden Years|publisher=BBC | date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the efforts of [[Dorothy Goodman|Dorothy and Ray Goodman]] in the [[United States]], Young continued to push the idea and in October 1957 the first ''Which?'' magazine was published from a converted garage in [[Bethnal Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Which? magazine, October 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Its central aim was to improve the standard of goods and services available to the public in the UK.

The publication started as a small 32-page magazine that included reports on electric kettles, sunglasses, aspirin, cake-mixes, scouring powders, no-iron cottons and British cars. 

By 1959, membership reached 150,000 and a membership services office in Hertford.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;&gt;''50 years of Which?'' supplement. Which? magazine, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1960–1970:''' 

In 1960, ''Which?'' helped to found the International Organisation of Consumer Unions, later [[Consumers International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/who-we-are/overview/the-history-of-which/ |title=The history of Which? - What is Which? - Who we are - About Which? |publisher=Which.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As circulation of ''Which? magazine'' increased, new premises were found in 1961 at 14, Buckingham Street, WC2. This collection of tiny offices and cubby holes, handily placed above the basement Gordon’s wine bar in Villiers Street, remained the centre for editorial, research and publishing activities until 1987.

In 1962, coverage expands with the launch of the first quarterly ''Which? car'' supplement, which becomes ''Motoring Which?'' in 1965, followed by ''Money Which?'' in 1968.

'''1970 - 1980:'''

In 1970, ''Which?'' bought a set of buildings in [[Harpenden]], Hertfordshire, to set up labs to test products including domestic appliances, DIY equipment, and consumer electronics. Previously, the work had been contracted out.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

The 1970s saw ''Which?'' taking a greater campaigning role, and it began to adopt a more aggressive stance on issues such as lead poisoning and aircraft noise. In 1971, for example, ''Which?'' published the first league table on the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

''Handyman Which?'' was launched in 1971, followed by ''Holiday Which?'' in 1974, and there was a deeper foray into book publishing throughout the decade. Guides on gardening, DIY and personal finance were launched in a book series called ''Which? Way''.

The organisation also dabbled in high street consumer advice centres during the 1970s. There were more than 120 such centres operating in 1977-8, with many of them funded by local councils. The centres closed as funding was withdrawn by the government in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

'''1980–1990:'''

In 1982, another ''Which?'' title launched - ''Gardening Which?'' - which coincided with the organisation's silver jubilee celebrations. A year later, ''Handyman Which?'', ''Money Which?'' and ''Motoring Which?'' titles were merged into a revamped full-colour ''Which? magazine''.

''Which?'' continued campaigning on consumer safety issues, with its car safety test results strengthening calls to legislate car manufacturers to fit seat belts in all new cars, helping to make it compulsory to [[Clunk Click Every Trip]] in 1983.

In 1986, ''Which?'' acquired health title Self Health&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt; which later becomes ''Health Which?''.

In 1987, the 300-strong employees moved to 2, [[Marylebone Road]], W1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/contact-us/ |title=Contact us - About Which? |publisher=Which.co.uk |date=20 March 2006 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to consolidating these functions in one properly-designed building. That the new space was too small to include the 60 staff of the Marketing Department, who occupied a different building in [[Euston Road]] for a number of years afterwards, was a minor oversight.

'''1990–2000:'''

In 1992, ''Which?'' launched another satellite publication, this one aimed at youngsters aged 11–15, called Check It Out!. The magazine failed to take off and closed in June 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

In 1995 testing facilities were moved to [[Milton Keynes]] where they remained until 2002, when the majority of the ''Which?'' testing activities were contracted out.

''Which?'' Online, the first incarnation of the Which? website, was launched in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;'See WayBack Archives http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.which.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''Computing Which?'' was published in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Which? Computing magazine, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2000–present day:'''

The whole organisation, including its charitable arm, formerly the Consumers' Association is rebranded as ''Which?'' in 2004.

Following the deregulation of the gas and electricity industry, ''Which?'' launched a free online energy comparison service called ''Switch with Which?'' in 2005, to help consumers compare energy tariffs and switch to a different supplier. The service was awarded [[Energywatch]] Confidence Code accreditation in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/news/2006/12/switch-with-which-gets-seal-of-approval-104612/ |title=Switch with Which? gets seal of approval - December - 2006 - Which? News |publisher=Which.co.uk |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital development continues throughout the decade: a new-look ''Which?'' website is launched in 2006 and again in 2010. In 2007 the organisation celebrated its 50th anniversary, and released a nostalgic supplement looking back at its first half century. More than 20 years after its first incarnation as ''Money Which?'', a new money-themed magazine called ''Which? Money'' is unveiled in February 2007.

In the 2010 Superbrands index, ''Which?'' is ranked 5th in the &quot;Media — Newspapers and Magazines&quot; category and 256th overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superbrands.uk.com/Pages/DocumentManager/ConsumerTop500_2010.pdf |title=Superbrands Official Top 500 2010 |publisher=Superbrands UK |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion-led blog tackling the ‘consumer issues of the day’, ''Which? Conversation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversation.which.co.uk/about/ |title=About Which? Conversation &amp;#124; Which? Conversation |publisher=Conversation.which.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an online mobile comparison and switching service, ''Which? Mobile'', both launch in 2010.

== Product testing ==

''Which?'' carries out systematic testing of consumer products and [[financial services]], the results of which are published in reports in its flagship publication, ''Which? magazine'', and on the ''Which?'' website. 

Tests are carried out on consumer items like electrical and white goods, [[cars]], and [[computers]], as well as [[health]] and financial and tradespeople services, and [[supermarkets]].  Testing highlights issues such as [[reliability engineering|reliability]], performance, safety, energy efficiency and value-for-money.

Top-rated products are awarded the ''Which?'' 'Best Buy' status logo,&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/what-we-offer/best-buy-scheme/&lt;/ref&gt; an accreditation well recognised by [[industry]] and consumers. ''Which?'' first used the phrase in its second magazine edition in 1958, to describe Boots 365 talcum powder.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt; Conversely, the worst performing products are labelled 'Don’t Buys'.

The ''Which?'' website has six topic-led sections: Technology, Home &amp; Garden, Cars, Money, Baby &amp; child and Energy. Each of the six sections includes a combination of subscription-only access to reviews and free advice articles about products and services Which? tests, reviews and investigates.

'''''Which?'' awards'''

The Which? Awards is an annual event to 'celebrate the UK’s best products and services, from cars and restaurants to supermarkets and financial services'.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/what-we-offer/which-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Award winners are selected by Which? staff, based on test findings and feedback from Which? members throughout the year. Winners include [[Hyundai]], [[First Direct]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Philips]].

Which? identifies where consumers are experiencing problems and provides practical policy solutions. Which? regularly briefs MPs, Peers, AMs, MLAs, MSPs and MEPs on consumer issues, addressing consumer detriment at a National, European and International level.

'''UK Government'''

Which? is in regular communication with politicians of all political parties in order to deliver positive change for UK consumers. For example, Which? successfully lobbied to put an end to the '65 day rule' that allowed energy companies to wait 65 days before informing their customers of a price change.&lt;ref&gt;The Times http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article7027970.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said Which?'s 'campaigns and magazines have transformed the world in which we live'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Which? magazine&quot;, May 2009. P.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Which? joined forces with Rt Hon [[David Davis (British politician)]] MP, Rt Hon [[John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith|John McFall]] MP and Dr [[Vince Cable]] MP, to form The Future of Banking Commission, which launched its recommendations in June 2010.

'''Scotland'''

In January 2002, Which? established an office in Edinburgh to strengthen lobbying work with members of the Scottish parliament.

'''European Union'''

Which? aims to put itself at the heart of [[EU]] policy and decision-making processes to ensure the voices of UK consumers are heard and, where necessary, influence international negotiations. 

It works with the European umbrella organisation, the [[European Consumers' Bureau|European Consumers' Association]] (BEUC)&lt;ref&gt;BEUC website http://www.beuc.org/Content/Default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; which brings together over forty consumer organisations from across Europe to represent common consumer interests within the EU institutions.

==Legal powers==

'''Super-complaints''' 

The Enterprise Act of 2002 enabled consumer organisations such as Which? to issue [[super-complaint]]s to the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT). 

Which? is one of eight organisations able to issue a super-complaint. The Consumers' Association was among the first groups granted these new powers. A super-complaint can be made about any market that is not working properly for consumers. As consumers are not in the position to overcome the issue themselves, Which? can issue a super-complaint on consumers' behalf. 
 
The OFT has 90 days in which to assess the complaint and decide what to do about it. It can reject the complaint in part or as a whole, it can launch a market investigation, take action under competition law or consumer law, or refer the market to the Competition Commission for further investigation. 

Which? made its first super complaint about private dentistry in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/super-complaints/dentistry&lt;/ref&gt; It has since made complaints about care homes, the Northern Ireland banking sector and [[credit card interest]] calculation methods. 

Its latest super complaint&lt;ref name=&quot;oft.gov.uk&quot;&gt;See http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/super-complaints/which-payment-surcharges&lt;/ref&gt; (March 2011) relates to unfair debit and credit card payment surcharges issued by retailers.
The OFT upheld the super-complaint in June 2011, described as a 'victory for consumers' by Which? chief executive, Peter Vicary Smith.&lt;ref name=&quot;which.co.uk&quot;&gt;See http://www.which.co.uk/news/2011/06/consumer-victory-as-oft-uphold-which-super-complaint--257422/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal action against rogue traders'''

In 2005 Which? was granted legal powers to bring rogue traders to account for their actions under Part 8 of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]]. 

'''Unfair contract terms'''

Which? has statutory powers under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]. Which? can seek an [[injunction]] to restrain the use of an unfair contract term by a trader against consumers.

'''Competition Appeals Tribunal'''

Which? is one of the 'specified bodies' who, under the Enterprise and Competition Acts, may bring proceedings before the Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) on behalf of two or more consumers for damages. 

Which? was granted specified body status on October 1, 2005 by the Ministers of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. In April 2007 Which? launched its first representative action on behalf of consumers unlawfully overcharged for football shirts due to price fixing.

==Organisational structure==

The Consumers’ Association is made up of a board who report to a council of trustees. The corporate management group, who run the day-to-day management of Which? Ltd, report to the Consumers Association and ensure the organisation is properly run in the charity's interest.

'''Council and members'''

The organisation is governed by a Council of 12 elected and six co-opted members. 
Patrick Barwise is the current chairman.

Any Which? member can stand for the Council, with Which? subscriber Roger Pittock elected in 2003, for instance. None of the Council or Board members are paid, although they are entitled to claim reasonable expenses.

==Which? campaigns==

The Which? campaigns website&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.which.co.uk/campaigns/&lt;/ref&gt; explains the organisation's latest lobbying positions, documents progress and explains how consumers can get involved.

In February 2011, ''Which?'' used its powers to launch a super-complaint against excessive credit card surcharges and fees.&lt;ref name=&quot;oft.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; The OFT upheld the super-complaint in June 2011, described as a 'victory for consumers' by ''Which?'' chief executive, Peter Vicary Smith.&lt;ref name=&quot;which.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

== Online services ==

'''''Which.co.uk'''''

The ''Which?'' website is the online arm of ''Which? magazine''. The website is used to regularly publish product reviews following independent testing, which only subscribing ''Which?'' customers are able to log in and view. The website also offers free, impartial advice content across a range of consumer interest areas, including Technology, Home &amp; Garden, Money, Cars, Baby &amp; Child and Environment &amp; Saving Energy.

Free videos and initial 'first look' product reviews are available for all readers to access. The website is also used to keep readers informed of ''Which?''’s latest campaigning work.

''Which?'' also has several 'spin-off' website services:

* '''''Which? Local''''': a subscription-only website for ''Which?'' customers which lists customer recommended local service providers and reviews – from builders to electricians to pubs.
* '''''Which? Conversation''''': a community-based blog site tackling topical consumer issues and inviting the general public and other organisations to join the debate.
* '''''Which? Switch''''': a free-to-use comparison service to help consumers compare energy tariffs and switch to a different supplier, accredited by [[Consumer Focus]], the industry watchdog.
