The '''stem cell controversy''' is the ethical debate primarily concerning the creation, treatment, and destruction of human embryos incident to research involving [[embryonic stem cells]]. Not all [[stem cell]] research involves the creation, use, or destruction of human embryos.  For example, [[adult stem cells]], [[amniotic stem cells]] and [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] do not involve human embryos at all.

==Background==
{{main|Stem cell}}

Since stem cells have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell, they offer something in the development of medical treatments for a wide range of conditions. Treatments that have been proposed include treatment for physical trauma, degenerative conditions, and genetic diseases (in combination with [[gene therapy]]). Yet further treatments using stem cells could potentially be developed thanks to their ability to repair extensive tissue damage.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060329083653.htm Stem Cells for Tissue Regeneration and Joint Repair]'' ''[[Science Daily]]'' 29th march 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Great levels of success and potential have been shown from research using adult stem cells. In early 2009, the FDA approved the first human clinical trials using embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are [[pluripotent]], and thus can become any other cell type excluding the placenta. Adult stem cells, however, are generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. However, some evidence suggests that adult stem cell plasticity may exist, increasing the number of cell types a given adult stem cell can become. In addition, embryonic stem cells are considered more useful for nervous system therapies, because researchers have struggled to identify and isolate [[nerve cell|neural progenitors]] from adult tissues. Embryonic    stem cells, however, might be rejected by the immune system - a problem which wouldn't occur if the patient received his or her own stem cells.

Some stem cell researchers are working to develop techniques of isolating stem cells that are as potent as embryonic stem cells, but do not require a human embryo.

Some believe that human skin cells can be coaxed to &quot;de-differentiate&quot; and revert to an embryonic state. Researchers at [[Harvard University]], led by [[Kevin Eggan]], have attempted to transfer the nucleus of a somatic cell into an existing embryonic stem cell, thus creating a new stem cell line.&lt;ref name=&quot;eggan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cowan CA, Atienza J, Melton DA, Eggan K |title=Nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells after fusion with human embryonic stem cells |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5739 |pages=1369–73 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16123299 |doi=10.1126/science.1116447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in August 2006 also indicates that differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state by introducing four specific factors, resulting in [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Takahashi K and Yamanaka S | title = Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | pages = 663–676 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Advanced Cell Technology, led by [[Robert Lanza]], reported the successful derivation of a stem cell line using a process similar to [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], in which a single [[blastomere]] is extracted from a [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lanza&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klimanskaya I, Chung Y, Becker S, Lu SJ, Lanza R |title=Human embryonic stem cell lines derived from single blastomeres |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7118 |pages=481–5 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=16929302 |doi=10.1038/nature05142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=3307505 ABC News: ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lanza announced that his team had succeeded in producing three new stem cell lines without destroying the parent embryos. &quot;These are the first human embryonic cell lines in existence that didn't result from the destruction of an embryo.&quot; Lanza is currently in discussions with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to determine whether the new technique sidesteps U.S. restrictions on federal funding for ES cell research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedcell.com/recent-news-item/reuters-us-company-says-grows-embryo-safe-stem-cells ScienceNOW - REUTERS: U.S. Company Says Grows Embryo-Safe Stem Cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Atala of [[Wake Forest University]] says that the fluid surrounding the fetus has been found to contain stem cells that, when utilized correctly, &quot;can be differentiated towards cell types such as fat, bone, muscle, blood vessel, nerve and liver cells&quot;. The extraction of this fluid is not thought to harm the fetus in any way. He hopes &quot;that these cells will provide a valuable resource for tissue repair and for engineered organs as well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Viewpoints ==
The status of the human [[embryo]] and human embryonic stem cell research is a [[controversial]] issue as, with the present state of technology, the creation of a human embryonic [[stem cell line]] requires the destruction of a human embryo. Stem cell debates have motivated and reinvigorated the [[pro-life]] movement, whose members are concerned with the rights and status of the embryo as an early-aged human life. They can believe that embryonic stem cell research instrumentalizes and violates the [[sanctity of life]] and some also view it as tantamount to [[murder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush&quot;&gt;&quot;The stated reason for President Bush's objection to embryonic stem cell research is that 'murder is wrong'&quot; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5197926.stm (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental assertion of those who oppose embryonic stem cell research is the belief that human life is inviolable, combined with the belief that human life begins when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell to form a single cell.

A portion of stem cell researchers use embryos that were created but not used in [[In vitro fertilization|in vitro fertility]] treatments to derive new stem cell lines. Most of these embryos are to be destroyed, or stored for long periods of time, long past their viable storage life. In the United States alone, there have been estimates of at least 400,000 such embryos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss2003&quot;&gt;Weiss, Rick. (May 8, 2003) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A27495-2003May7 &quot;400,000 Human Embryos Frozen in U.S.,&quot;] ''Washington Post''. Retrieved August 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  See also [[Embryo donation]].

Medical researchers widely submit that stem cell research has the potential to dramatically alter approaches to understanding and treating diseases, and to alleviate suffering. In the future, most medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat a variety of diseases and impairments. Spinal cord injuries and Parkinson's disease are two examples that have been championed by high-profile media personalities (for instance, [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Michael J. Fox]], who have lived with these conditions, respectively). The anticipated medical benefits of stem cell research add urgency to the debates, which has been appealed to by proponents of embryonic stem cell research.

In August 2000, The U.S. National Institutes of Health's Guidelines stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...research involving human pluripotent stem cells...promises new treatments and possible cures for many debilitating diseases and injuries, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, burns and spinal cord injuries. The NIH believes the potential medical benefits of human pluripotent stem cell technology are compelling and worthy of pursuit in accordance with appropriate ethical standards.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2000/od-23.htm
|title= NIH Publishes Final Guidelines for Stem Cell Research|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]|year= 2000|accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, researchers at Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Massachusetts, succeeded in obtaining stem cells from mouse embryos without destroying the embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/healthnews.php?newsid=50329|title= Deriving Stem Cells Without Killing Embryo|publisher= Medical News Today|year=2006|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this technique and its reliability are improved, it would alleviate some of the ethical concerns related to embryonic stem cell research.

Another technique announced in 2007 may also defuse the longstanding debate and controversy.  Research teams in the United States and Japan have developed a simple and cost effective method of reprogramming human skin cells to function much like embryonic stem cells by introducing artificial viruses.  While extracting and cloning stem cells is complex and extremely expensive, the newly discovered method of reprogramming cells is much cheaper. However, the technique may disrupt the DNA in the new stem cells, resulting in damaged and cancerous tissue.  More research will be required before non-cancerous stem cells can be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/autocodes/countries/japan/new-stem-cell-breakthrough-$1169327.htm|title= New stem cell breakthrough|publisher=inthenews.co.uk|year=2007|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/science/06cnd-cell.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title= Biologists Make Skin Cells Work Like Stem Cells|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-12-26 | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060601345.html|title= Scientists Use Skin To Create Stem Cells|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2007-12-26 | first=Rick | last=Weiss | date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june07/stemcell_06-07.html|title= Scientists Convert Mouse Skin Cells to Stem Cells|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|year= 2007|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Update article to include 2009/2010 current stem cell usages in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01162915?term=stem+cells+covington&amp;rcv_d=14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01046786?term=China+Spinal+Cord+Injury+Network&amp;rank=4&lt;/ref&gt; The planned treatment trials will focus on the effects of oral lithium on neurological function in people with chronic spinal cord injury and those that have received umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell transplants to the spinal cord. The interest in these two treatments derives from recent reports indicating that '''umbilical cord blood stem cells''' may be beneficial for spinal cord injury and that lithium may promote regeneration and recovery of function after spinal cord injury. Both lithium and umbilical cord blood are widely available therapies that have long been used to treat diseases in humans.

=== Endorsement ===

* Embryonic stem cells have the potential to grow indefinitely in a laboratory environment and can differentiate into almost all types of bodily tissue. This makes embryonic stem cells a prospect for [[cell therapy|cellular therapies]] to treat a wide range of diseases.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spinneypress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Spinneypress|year=2006|url=http://www.spinneypress.com.au/178_book_desc.html |title=Arguments For Stem cell Research|accessdate=2007-12-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080201224807/http://www.spinneypress.com.au/178_book_desc.html |archivedate = 2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human potential and humanity====

This argument often goes hand-in-hand with the [[utilitarian]] argument, and can be presented in several forms:

* Embryos are not equivalent to human life while they are still incapable of surviving outside the womb (i.e. they only have the potential for life).

* More than a third of [[zygotes]] do not implant after conception.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J. Devettere. [http://books.google.com/books?id=TYsgz49FrQ8C&amp;pg=PA177 Practical Decision Making in Health Care Ethics]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Stassen Berger.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=JsfgHiWqWeYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116 The Developing Person Through the Life Span]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, far more embryos are lost due to chance than are proposed to be used for embryonic stem cell research or treatments.
* Blastocysts are a cluster of human cells that have not differentiated into distinct organ tissue; making cells of the inner cell mass no more &quot;human&quot; than a skin cell.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spinneypress&quot;&gt;Spinneypress.(2006) [http://www.spinneypress.com.au/178_book_desc.html &quot;Arguments For Stem cell Research,&quot;] '''Stem Cell Research'''. Retrieved August 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some parties contend that embryos are not humans, believing that the life of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' only begins when the heartbeat develops, which is during the 5th week of pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Marjorie. “[http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,9851,00.html Dr. Spock.com]&quot;.  Retrieved 2007-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; or when the brain begins developing activity, which has been detected at 54 days after conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;&gt;Singer, Peter. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312144016&amp;id=d5W1xE1GM2EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA104&amp;lpg=RA1-PA104&amp;ots=kG4PXGCQDG&amp;dq=%22human+life+must+be+protected+from+fifty-four+days%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=PWH7KEPjVWhxAkFWTAwd3DWuyB0#PRA1-PA104,M1 Rethinking life &amp; death: the collapse of our traditional ethics]'', page 104 (St. Martins Press 1996).  Retrieved 2007-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Efficiency====

* [[In vitro fertilization]] (IVF) generates large numbers of unused embryos (e.g. 70,000 in Australia alone).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt; Many of these thousands of IVF embryos are slated for destruction. Using them for scientific research uses a resource that would otherwise be wasted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* While the destruction of human embryos is required to establish a stem cell line, no new embryos have to be destroyed to work with existing stem cell lines. It would be wasteful not to continue to make use of these cell lines as a resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Abortions are legal in many countries and jurisdictions. The argument then follows that if these embryos are being destroyed anyway, why not use them for stem cell research or treatments?

====Superiority====

This is usually presented as a counter-argument to using adult stem cells as an alternative that doesn't involve embryonic destruction.

* Embryonic stem cells make up a significant proportion of a developing embryo, while adult stem cells exist as minor populations within a mature individual (e.g. in every 1,000 cells of the bone marrow, only 1 will be a usable stem cell). Thus, embryonic stem cells are likely to be easier to isolate and grow [[ex vivo]] than adult stem cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Embryonic stem cells divide more rapidly than adult stem cells, potentially making it easier to generate large numbers of cells for therapeutic means.  In contrast, adult stem cell might not divide fast enough to offer immediate treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Embryonic stem cells have greater plasticity, potentially allowing them to treat a wider range of diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Adult stem cells from the patient's own body might not be effective in treatment of genetic disorders. [[Allograft|Allogeneic]] embryonic stem cell transplantation (i.e. from a healthy donor) may be more practical in these cases than [[gene therapy]] of a patient's own cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* DNA abnormalities found in adult stem cells that are caused by toxins and sunlight may make them poorly suited for treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Embryonic stem cells have been shown to be effective in treating heart damage in mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinneypress&quot;/&gt;

* Embryonic stem cells have the potential to cure chronic and degenerative diseases which current medicine has been unable to effectively treat.

====Individuality====

* Before the [[primitive streak]] is formed when the embryo attaches to the uterus at approximately 14 days after fertilization, a single fertilized egg can split in two to form [[Twin#Semi-identical twins|identical twins]], or a pair of embryos that would have resulted in [[Twin#Fraternal.2FSororal .28dizygotic.29 twins|fraternal twins]] can fuse together and develop into one person (a [[Chimera (genetics)#Tetragametic_chimerism|tetragametic chimera]]).  Since a fertilized egg has the potential to be two individuals or half of one, some believe it can only be considered a ''potential'' person, not an actual one.  Those who subscribe to this belief then hold that destroying a blastocyst for embryonic stem cells is ethical.&lt;ref name = &quot;AtIssueEthicsofGE&quot;&gt;West, Michael D.(2005) The Ethics of Genetic Engineering (At Issue Series). (pp 100-107) USA: Thomson Gale&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viability====

* [[Viability (fetal)|Viability]] is another standard under which embryos and fetuses have been regarded as human lives. In the United States, the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' concluded that viability determined the permissibility of [[abortion]]s performed for reasons other than the protection of the woman's health, defining ''viability'' as the point at which a fetus is &quot;potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe&quot;&gt;''Roe v. Wade'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;page=113 410 U.S. 113] (1973). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved 2007-05-15&lt;/ref&gt; The point of viability was 24 to 28 weeks when the case was decided and has since moved to about 22 weeks due to advancement in medical technology. Embryos used in medical research for stem cells are well below development that would enable viability.

===Moral and ethical concerns===

*Many questions arise of this concern, Julian Savulescu &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Medical Ethics (April 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; lists several arguments.
*It is liable to abuse.  It violates a person's right to individuality, autonomy, self-hood.  It allows eugenic selection.
*His journal goes into details of the advantages of using stem cell lines mainly for therapeutic reasons with great emphasis on control.  The main reason is that if this regeneration practice goes un-checked, there will be someone out there that will be &quot;playing God.&quot;

=== Objection ===
====&quot;Better alternatives&quot;====

This argument is used by opponents of embryonic destruction as well as researchers specializing in adult stem cell research.

Pro-life supporters often claim that the use of adult stem cells from sources such as umbilical cord blood has consistently produced more promising results than the use of embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prentice&quot;&gt;Prentice, David. (October 17, 2005) [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/october/24.71.html &quot;Live Patients &amp; Dead Mice&quot;.] ''Christianity Today''. Retrieved on August 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, adult stem cell research may be able to make greater advances if less money and resources were channeled into embryonic stem cell research.&lt;ref name=&quot;CARE&quot;&gt;The Coalition of Americans for Research Ethics. [http://www.stemcellresearch.org/polisci/index.html &quot;The &quot;Political Science&quot; of Stem Cells&quot;.] Retrieved on July 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryonic stem cells have never produced therapies (to date, adult stem cells have been used in treatment).&lt;ref&gt;Accessed: 11/1/10 | First person treated in milestone stem cell trial | 17:59 11 October 2010 by Andy Coghlan | http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19570-first-person-treated-in-milestone-stem-cell-trial.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, there have been many advances in adult stem cell research, including a recent study where pluripotent adult stem cells were manufactured from differentiated fibroblast by the addition of specific transcription factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cyranoski D |title=Simple switch turns cells embryonic |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7145 |pages=618–9 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17554270 |doi=10.1038/447618a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly created stem cells were developed into an embryo and were integrated into newborn mouse tissues, analogous to the properties of embryonic stem cells.

This argument remains hotly debated on both sides. Those critical of embryonic stem cell research point to a current lack of practical treatments, while supporters argue that advances will come with more time and that breakthroughs cannot be predicted.

==Ethical theories==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
The main  ethical theories used by opponents and supporters  in this controversy  are consequentialism (utilitarianism) and deontological ethics.  Consequentialism is the ethical theory that assess the rightness or wrongness of a certain action based on the desirability of the results or the consequences of the action. In this theory good actions are actions that brings happiness or pleasure to the largest number of people. Unlike consequentialism, deontological ethics primary concern is the action in its self. The word Deon is a Greek word that means duty or obligation. This ethical theory judges the wrongness or rightness of an action based on the conformity of that action with certain norms or principals.  [[Immanuel Kant]], a German philosopher expressed his deontological theory using the categorical imperatives. These categorical imperatives are principles that serve to guide the conduct of people.  One of Kant’s categorical imperatives says, “always treat persons as ends in themselves and not merely as means to some other end.” If we give to the human embryo the moral status of a person, then under this principle it will be wrong to destroy the human embryo to save the lives of others.

In 1973, [[Roe v. Wade]] legalized abortion in the United States. Five years later, the first successful human ''in vitro'' fertilization resulted in the birth of [[Louise Brown]] in England. These developments prompted the federal government to create regulations barring the use of federal funds for research that experimented on human embryos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlsna&quot;&gt;

In response to the panel's recommendations, the Clinton administration, citing moral and ethical concerns, declined to fund research on embryos created solely for research purposes,&lt;ref name = &quot;stemcellclinton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did agree to fund research on left-over embryos created by ''in vitro'' fertility treatments. At this point, the Congress intervened and passed the [[Dickey Amendment]] in 1995 (the final bill, which included the Dickey Amendment, was signed into law by Bill Clinton) which prohibited any federal funding for the Department of Health and Human Services be used for research that resulted in the destruction of an embryo regardless of the source of that embryo.

In 1998, privately funded research led to the breakthrough discovery of Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC). This prompted the Clinton Administration to re-examine guidelines for federal funding of embryonic research. In 1999, the president's National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended that hESC harvested from embryos discarded after ''in vitro'' fertility treatments, but not from embryos created expressly for experimentation, be eligible for federal funding.&lt;!-- Apparently stale link: [http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/nbac/execsumm.pdf] --&gt; Though embryo destruction had been inevitable in the process of harvesting hESC in the past (this is no longer the case&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/full/nature05142.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19112879|year=2008|last1=Kao|first1=CF|last2=Chuang|first2=CY|last3=Chen|first3=CH|last4=Kuo|first4=HC|title=Human pluripotent stem cells: Current status and future perspectives|volume=51|issue=4|pages=214–25|journal=The Chinese journal of physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedcell.com/news-and-media/cellular-therapy-press-releases/nih-approves-advanced-cell-technologys-stem-cell-line-for-federal-funding/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedcell.com/documents/0000/0254/Press_Release_MA135_approval_-_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), the Clinton Administration had decided that it would be permissible under the Dickey Amendment to fund hESC research as long as such research did not itself directly cause the destruction of an embryo. Therefore, HHS issued its proposed regulation concerning hESC funding in 2001. Enactment of the new guidelines was delayed by the incoming [[George W. Bush]] administration which decided to reconsider the issue.

President Bush announced, on August 9, 2001 that federal funds, for the first time, would be made available for hESC research. However, the Bush Administration chose to limit taxpayer funding to then-existing hESC cell lines, thereby limiting federal funding to research in which &quot;the life-and-death decision has already been made&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html The White House, Press Release, August 9, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration's guidelines differ from the Clinton Administration guidelines which did not distinguish between currently existing and not-yet-existing hESC. Both the Bush and Clinton guidelines agree that the federal government should not fund hESC research that directly destroys embryos.

Neither Congress nor any administration has ever prohibited private funding of embryonic research. Public and private funding of research on adult and cord blood stem cells is unrestricted.

=====U.S. Congressional response=====
In April 2004, 206 out of 500 members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed a letter urging President Bush to expand federal funding of embryonic stem cell research beyond what Bush had already supported.

In May 2005, the House of Representatives voted 238-194 to loosen the limitations on federally funded embryonic stem-cell research — by allowing government-funded research on surplus frozen embryos from [[in vitro fertilization]] clinics to be used for stem cell research with the permission of donors — despite Bush's promise to veto the bill if passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,67627,00.html|title=A Step Closer to Stem-Cell Heaven|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2008-02-28|date=May 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 2005, [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist|William H. Frist]] (R-[[Tennessee|TN]]), announced that he too favored loosening restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.&lt;ref name = &quot;stemcell14&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2006, the Senate passed three different bills concerning stem cell research.  The Senate passed the first bill ([[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]]), 63-37, which would have made it legal for the Federal government to spend Federal money on embryonic stem cell research that uses embryos left over from ''in vitro'' fertilization procedures.&lt;ref name = &quot;stemcell3&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 2006 President Bush vetoed this bill. The second bill makes it illegal to create, grow, and abort fetuses for research purposes.  The third bill would encourage research that would isolate pluripotent, i.e., embryonic-like, stem cells without the destruction of human embryos.

In 2005 and 2007, Congressman [[Ron Paul]] introduced the Cures Can Be Found Act,&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 457, 110th Congress&lt;/ref&gt; with 10 cosponsors. With an [[income tax]] credit, the bill favors [[stem-cell research|research]] upon non embryonic stem cells obtained from [[placenta]]s, [[umbilical cord]] [[blood]], [[amniotic fluid]], humans after birth, or unborn human offspring who died of natural causes; the bill was referred to committee. Paul argued that hESC research is outside of federal jurisdiction either to ban or to subsidize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronpaullibrary.org/document.php?id=839|title=Rights of Taxpayers is Missing Element in Stem Cell Debate|publisher=The Ron Paul Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush vetoed another bill, the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act|Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|110|S.|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have  amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to provide for human embryonic [[stem cell research]]. The bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on April 11 by a vote of 63-34, then passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] on June 7 by a vote of 247-176. President Bush vetoed the bill on July 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3031459 &quot;Senate Approves Embryonic Stem Cell Bill&quot;], David Espo, [[Associated Press]], April 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2009, President Obama removed the restriction on federal funding for newer stem cell lines.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/09/obama.stem.cells/index.html &quot;Obama overturns Bush policy on stem cells&quot;] [[CNN]], March 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after Obama removed the restriction, the President then signed the [[Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009]], which still contained the long-standing [[Dickey Amendment|Dickey-Wicker]] provision which bans federal funding of &quot;research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/14/obamas-approval-stem-cell-research-needs-congressional-action/ Obama's Stem Cell Policy Hasn't Reversed Legislative Restrictions], Fox News, March 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the Congressional provision effectively prevents federal funding being used to create new [[stem cell line]]s by many of the known methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlsna&quot; /&gt; So, while scientists might not be free to create new lines with federal funding, President Obama's policy allows the potential of applying for such funding into research involving the hundreds of existing stem cell lines as well as any further [[Stem cell line|lines]] created using private funds or state-level funding.  The ability to apply for federal funding for [[stem cell line]]s created in the private sector is a significant expansion of options over the limits imposed by President Bush, who restricted funding to the 21 viable stem cell lines that were created before he announced his decision in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
The ethical concerns raised during Clinton's time in office continue to restrict hESC research and dozens of stem cell lines have been excluded from funding, now by judgment of an administrative office rather than Presidential or legislative discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/about/director/06212010statement_stemcell.htm &quot;Statement from the Director on the Addition of New Lines to the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry&quot;] [[NIH]], June 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Funding=====
In 2005 the NIH funded $607 million worth of stem cell research, of which $39 million was specifically used for hESC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/fundingresearchareas.htm|title=Estimates of Funding for Various Diseases, Conditions, Research Areas|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigrid Fry-Revere]] has argued that private organizations, not the federal government, should provide funding for stem-cell research, so that shifts in public opinion and government policy would not bring valuable scientific research to a grinding halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8205|title=Best Hope Lies in Private Stem-Cell Funding|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the State of California took out 3 billion dollars in bond loans to fund embryonic stem cell research in that state.&lt;ref&gt;http://cirm.ca.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia====

[[China]] has one of the most permissive human embryonic stem cell policies in the world. In the absence of a public controversy, human embryo stem cell research is supported by policies that allow the use of human embryos and therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalogue.lse.ac.uk/Record/1250034&quot;] &quot;Kerstin Klein, Illiberal Biopolitics, Human Embryos and the Stem Cell Controversy in China, 2010&quot;] [[LSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Iran has banned embryonic stem cell lines.

===Religious views===
{{see also|Christian views on cloning}}

====Christianity====

=====Baptists=====
The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] opposes human embryonic stem cell research on the grounds that &quot;Bible teaches that human beings are made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27; 9:6) and protectable human life begins at fertilization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBC—Stem Cell Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=620| title = Resolution On Human Embryonic And Stem Cell Research|publisher = [[Southern Baptist Convention]]|accessdate = 2007–06–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it supports adult stem cell research as it does &quot;not require the destruction of embryos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBC—Stem Cell Research&quot;/&gt;

=====Catholicism=====
In regards, to [[embryonic stem cell research]], the [[Catholic Church]] affirms that &quot;the killing of innocent human creatures, even if carried out to help others, constitutes an absolutely unacceptable act.&quot; The deliberate destruction of a human embryo is incompatible with [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] doctrine, according to which, [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] has stated that human blastocysts are inherently valuable and should not be voluntarily destroyed as they are &quot;from the moment of the union of the gametes&quot; human subjects with well defined identities. The Church supports research that involves stem cells from adult tissues and the umbilical cord, as it &quot;involves no harm to human beings at any state of development.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RCC—Stem Cell Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/bioethic/bishopsESCRstmt.pdf| title = On Embryonic Stem Cell Research|publisher = [[USCCB Publishing]]|accessdate = 2007–06–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodism=====
In regards, to [[embryonic stem cell research]], the [[United Methodist Church]] stands in &quot;opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research&quot; as &quot;a human [[embryo]], even at its earliest stages, commands our reverence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Stem Cell Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=6560| title = Ethics of Embryonic Stem Cell Research |publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate = 2007–06–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it supports [[adult stem cell research]], stating that there are &quot;few moral questions&quot; raised by this issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Stem Cell Research&quot;/&gt;

=====Pentecostalism=====
The [[Assemblies of God]] opposes &quot;the practice of cultivating stem cells from the tissue of aborted fetuses&quot; because it &quot;perpetuates the evil of [[abortion]] and should be prohibited.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AG—Stem Cell Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ag.org/top/beliefs/position_papers/pp_downloads/pp_4196_sanctity_human_life.pdf| title = Sanctity of Human Life Including Abortion and Euthanasia |publisher = [[Assemblies of God]]|accessdate = 2007–06–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints=====
“The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not taken a position regarding the use of embryonic stem cells for research purposes. The absence of a position should not be interpreted as support for or opposition to any other statement made by Church members, whether they are for or against embryonic stem cell research.”&lt;ref name=&quot;LDS—Stem Cell Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://newsroom.lds.org/official-statement/embryonic-stem-cell-research| title = Embryonic Stem-cell Research |publisher = [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate = 2011–10–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
Thus, Islam’s obligation towards knowledge coupled with its tradition towards not allowing surrogate parenting or embryo adoption, leads many Islamic scholars to believe that the Qur'an can be used to support stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfaith.org/islam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
According to Rabbi Levi Yitschak Halperin of the Institute for Science and Jewish Law in Jerusalem, embryonic stem cell research is permitted so long as it has not been implanted in the womb. Not only is it permitted, but research is encouraged, rather than wasting it.

{{cquote|As long as it has not been implanted in the womb and it is still a frozen fertilized egg, it does not have the status of an embryo at all and there is no prohibition to destroy it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However in order to remove all doubt [as to the permissibility of destroying it], it is preferable not to destroy the pre-embryo unless it will otherwise not be implanted in the woman who gave the eggs (either because there are many fertilized eggs, or because one of the parties refuses to go on with the procedure - the husband or wife - or for any other reason). Certainly it should not be implanted into another woman.... The best and worthiest solution is to use it for life-saving purposes, such as for the treatment of people that suffered trauma to their nervous system, etc.|||Rabbi Levi Yitschak Halperin|Ma'aseh Choshev vol. 3, 2:6}}

Similarly, the sole Jewish majority state, [[Israel]], permits research on embryonic stem cells.
