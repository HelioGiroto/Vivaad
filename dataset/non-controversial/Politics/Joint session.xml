A '''joint session''' or '''joint convention''' is, most broadly, when two normally-separate [[Decision making|decision]]-making groups meet together, often in a [[special session]] or other extraordinary meeting, for a specific purpose.

Most often it refers to when both houses of a [[bicameral]] [[legislature]] sit together. A joint session typically occurs to receive foreign or domestic [[diplomat]]s or [[leader]]s, or to allow both houses to consider [[bill (law)|bill]]s together.

Some Constitutions give special power to a joint session, voting by majority of all Members of the Legislature regardless of which House/ chamber they belong to. For example, in Switzerland a joint session of the two houses elects the members of the Federal Council (cabinet). In [[India]], disputes between Houses are resolved by a joint sitting but without an intervening election.&lt;ref name=&quot;President summons joint sitting of Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=President summons joint sitting of Parliament|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-03-22/news/27358290_1_rajya-sabha-joint-session-anti-terrorism-bill|accessdate=31 July 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=Mar 22, 2002|agency=PTI|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69YZE2vx4|archivedate=31 July 2012|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia, if a Bill is deadlocked, then following a [[double dissolution]] of both Houses, and if the new Parliament is still unable to pass the Bill, then the Bill may be passed by an absolute majority of a joint sitting. The only such example of this occurring was the [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974]] under the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government.

== Canada ==
The [[Canadian government]] procedure is called a [[joint address (Canada)|joint address]], with the members of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] attending the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] as guests. There is no procedure in Canada for both chambers of the [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] to sit in a true joint session.

Various [[government agencies]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s may also meet jointly to handle problems which each of the involved parties has a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stake]] in.

== France ==
The [[Congress of France]] is an assembly of both houses of the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]], convened at the [[Palace of Versailles]], which can approve certain amendments to the [[Constitution of France|constitution]] by a three-fifth majority of all members. Since 2008, the Congress may also be convened to hear an address from the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].

== India ==
In [[India]], if a [[bill (law)|bill]] has been rejected by the [[upper house]] ([[Rajya Sabha]]) of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and more than six months have lapsed, the [[President of India|President]] may summon a joint session for passing the bill. The bill is passed by simple majority of a joint sitting. Since the [[lower house]] ([[Lok Sabha]]) has more than twice the members in upper house,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rajya Sabha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=RAJYA SABHA - AN INTRODUCTION|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/about_parliament/rajya_sabha_introduction.asp|publisher=rajyasabha.nic.in|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lok Sabha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lok Sabha|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/introls.htm|publisher=parliamentofindia.nic.in|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; group commanding majority in lower house i.e. [[Govt of India]] can get such a bill passed although it was rejected by the upper house.

Until now, only three [[bill (law)|bill]]s namely the [[Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961]], the [[Banking Service Commission Repeal Bill, 1978]] and the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002]] have been passed at joint sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;President summons joint sitting of Parliament&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;782 MPs await novel joint session&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=782 MPs await novel joint session |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-03-23/news/27343982_1_rajya-sabha-joint-session-controversial-anti-terrorism-bill |accessdate=31 July 2012 |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=Mar 23, 2002 |agency=TNN |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}
The [[State of the Union Address]] of the [[president of the United States]] is traditionally made before a &quot;joint session&quot; of the [[United States Congress]]. Many states refer to an analogous event as a &quot;joint convention&quot;.  Such assemblies are typically held in the chamber of the [[lower house]] as the larger body.  

[[State constitution (United States)|State constitutions]] of [[U.S. state]]s may require joint conventions for other purposes; for example [[Tennessee]]'s requires such to elect the [[Tennessee secretary of state|secretary of state]], the state treasurer, and the [[comptroller]] of the [[treasury]].

== United Kingdom ==
A similar event is the [[speech from the throne]] upon the state opening of Parliament in [[Commonwealth Realm]]s is made before a joint sitting of the both Houses. In most cases this event occurs in the Upper Chamber, due to the British [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the monarch never enters the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] chamber. An exception was the [[Governor-General's Address to Dáil Éireann|Governor-General's Address]] in the [[Irish Free State]], which was made to [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|the lower house]], with [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senators]] invited to attend.
