An '''electoral wipeout''' occurs when a major party receives far fewer votes or seats in a Legislature than their position justifies. It is the opposite of a [[landslide victory]]; the two frequently going hand in hand.

Note that the use of the phrase generally assumes that the returns were the product of a legitimate election; [[show elections]] to fraudulent legislatures regularly produce incredibly strong majorities for the ruling party(s).

== Australia ==
Between 1901 and 1949, the upper house of the [[Australian Senate]] was elected by a system of majoritarian or &quot;winner-take-all&quot; voting. Each state had 3 of its 6 Senators retiring at each half-senate election. Each voter had 3 votes at each election, whether by first-past-the-post ([[FPTP]]) 1901-1918, or the [[alternative vote]]. It was often the case that the 3 seats all went the same way, leading to lopsided results in the six states such as 36-0 or 3-33. These results brought the parliament into some disrepute.

In 1948, the [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV) was introduced. At the same time, the number of senators per state was increased from 6 to 10, with 5 instead of 3 retiring at each triennial election. The increased number of vacancies per election would have exacerbated the &quot;landslide/wipeout&quot; effect if the old winner-take-all system had been retained. Instead, having more seats ''increased'' the degree of proportionality between votes received and seats won by parties.

Since the introduction of STV in the Senate, the parties have generally been evenly balanced, with minor parties and independents holding the balance of power. While frustrated, the government in the lower house has had a lot of different people to negotiate with.

In the 2004 election, the government did the nearly impossible and gained the 57% of the vote in one state to obtain a majority in its own right in the senate from July 2005, when the new senators take up their seats. The number of quotas required to win a majority (four) of six seats, at 57% (four-sevenths of the votes), is so high because there are an even number of seats.

In the lower house, FPTP was changed to preferential voting in 1918.

In the 1974 Queensland state election, using single-member electorates and [[full-preferential voting]], the Labor opposition was reduced to a &quot;[[cricket]] team&quot; of eleven MPs, against the National Country Party/ Liberal Party Coalition government with 69 seats (and 2 Independents).

* In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011]], the [[Bloc Québécois]] was reduced to 4 seats.
*In the [[British Columbia general election, 2001]] the governing NDP was reduced to two seats, with the other 77 being won by the Liberals.

==New Zealand==
Until it moved to a [[proportional representation]] system in 1996, general elections in New Zealand were also prone to the possibility of wipeouts, though these in general involved the likelihood of third parties getting few or no seats rather than one of the two major parties being massively underrepresented. This former circumstance occurred most starkly in the [[New Zealand general election, 1981|1981 general election]], in which the [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|Social Credit Party]] gained 16.1% of the vote yet gained only two seats in the 92-seat parliament.

The [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 general election]] did, however, see a major party wipeout, and led to the creation of a new major party. In the 1935 election, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] gained 46.1% of the vote to the [[United/Reform Coalition]]'s 32.9%, but won 53 seats to the United/Reform's 19. As a result of this election the two coalition parties merged to form the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]], which remains a major force is current New Zealand politics.

== Elsewhere ==
* [[Philippine Senate election, 1955]]: With the 24-seat [[Senate of the Philippines]] elected via nationwide [[plurality-at-large voting]] (8 votes per voter) and on [[staggered election]]s, the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]'s seven seats were lost when none of their candidates finished eighth place or higher, despite having 29% of the vote. After the election, the [[Nacionalista Party]] then had 21 seats, and two minor parties having 3 seats with one seat vacant.
* In the 2000 Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] Election, the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] overturned a large majority for the Democratic Union, winning 72 out of the 76 seats contested.
