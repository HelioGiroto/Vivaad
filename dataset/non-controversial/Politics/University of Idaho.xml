The '''University of Idaho''' (officially abbreviated '''UI,''' but commonly referred to as the '''U of I''') is the State of [[Idaho]]'s oldest public university located in the rural city of [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] in [[Latah County, Idaho|Latah County]] in the [[North Central Idaho|northern portion]] of the state. UI is the state's primary research [[university]], and enrolls more national merit scholars than all other institutions in the state combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provost.uidaho.edu/documents/University%20of%20Idaho%20Mission%20statement.pdf&amp;pid=102669&amp;doc=1 Mission Statement approved by the Idaho State Board of Education, August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uidaho.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.uidaho.edu/about/pointsofpride Points of Pride-About U-Idaho-University of Idaho&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the university enrolled the highest number of National Merit Scholars of any school in the Northwest; more than the other flagship institutions in the region with significantly larger enrollments.&lt;ref name=&quot;uidaho.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=university-of-idaho-enrolls-highest-number-of-new-national-merit-scholars-in-nw-46420&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Idaho was the state's sole university for 71 years, until [[Idaho State University|1963]], and hosts the [[University of Idaho College of Law]], which was established in 1909, accredited by the [[American Bar Association|ABA]] in 1925, and remained until 2012 the only law school in the state.

The university was formed by the territorial legislature of Idaho on January 30, 1889, and opened its doors on October 3, 1892 with an initial class of 40 students.  The first graduating class in 1896 contained two men and two women. The university presently has an enrollment exceeding 12,000, with over 11,000 on the Moscow campus.  The university offers 142 degree programs, from [[accountancy]] to [[Wildlife management|wildlife resources]], including [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|master's]], [[Doctorate|doctoral]], and specialists' degrees.  Certificates of completion are offered in 30 areas of study.  At 25% and 53%, its 4 and 6 year graduation rates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/communications_center/documents/publications/2012_higher_ed_factbook.pdf Idaho State Board of Education 2012 Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; are the highest of any public university in Idaho, and it generates 74 percent of all research money in the state, with research expenditures of $100 million in 2010 alone.

As a rural [[land-grant university]], UI has the largest campus in the state, located in the rolling hills of the [[Palouse]] region at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|2600|ft|m|-1}} [[AMSL|above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=12&amp;Z=11&amp;X=624&amp;Y=6468&amp;W=2&amp;qs=%7cMoscow%7cID%7c Topographic map] from [[USGS]] ''[[The National Map]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The school is home to the [[Idaho Vandals]], who compete on the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] (formerly I-A) level. The land-grant institution for the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Washington State University|WSU]], is located eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) west in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]]. In addition to the main campus in Moscow, the UI has branch campuses in [[Coeur d'Alene]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]].  It also operates a research park in [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uidaho.edu/uirp uidaho.edu] - UI Research Park - accessed 2011-08-31&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of extension offices statewide.

== Timeline ==
[[Timeline of University of Idaho]]

== Campus ==
UI has one of the most scenic campuses in the western [[United States|U.S.]]. The master plan for the UI campus was originally designed in 1908 by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] of [[Massachusetts]], the sons of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]; their [[landscape architecture]] firm designed the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] grounds, [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], and many other notable college campuses, particularly in the West.  The [[Palouse]] region has rolling hills with rivers and lakes, with mountains nearby, offering a wide variety of recreational opportunities.

[[File:Adm 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|The original Administration building (1899) was destroyed by fire in 1906. It was replaced in 1909 by the existing brick [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] structure.]]
[[File:University of Idaho Administration Building - north side.jpg|thumb|200px|Administration Building.]]
According to the UI Facts Books, the [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] campus is an {{convert|1585|acre|km2}} including 253 buildings with a replacement value of $812 million, {{convert|10|mi|km}}, {{convert|49|acre|ha}} of parking lots, {{convert|1.22|mi|km}} of bike paths, 22 computer labs, an 18-hole [[University of Idaho Golf Course|golf course]] on {{convert|150|acre|ha}}, {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of arboreta, and {{convert|860|acre|km2}} of farms.

There are several distinctive areas on campus.

===Administration Building===
The east-facing Administration Building, with its {{convert|80|ft|0|sing=on}} clock tower and [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]]-style structure, was built from 1907â09 and has become an [[Secular icon|icon]] of the university.  The building holds classrooms, an auditorium, and administrative offices, including the offices of the [[List of University of Idaho people#Presidents of the University of Idaho|President]] and [[Provost (education)|Provost]].  Multiple expansions were made, with the north wing added in 1912, the south wing in 1916 (extended in 1936 for the library), and the functional annex in 1950, incorporated into the Albertson addition of 2002. The UI library was housed in the Admin. building until 1957, when the Library building was completed.

The original Administration Building, with a single tall [[spire]] reaching to {{convert|163|ft}}, was constructed through the decade of the 1890s and ultimately finished in 1899. Unfortunately, it was reduced to embers on March 30, 1906&lt;ref name=sdc06fire&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-KlXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7vMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5816%2C6424636|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|title=Idaho's university is a heap of ashes now|date=March 30, 1906|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spr06firea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D6hXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mfMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6212%2C4652738|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|title=Administration building, Idaho university, burns; loss $200,000 |date=April 3, 1906|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/1-51-24.jpg photo]); the cause of the fire, which began in the basement, was never precisely determined, but was likely accidental.&lt;ref name=lmt61admin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-MBeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gzEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1936,4313248|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Allen|first=Margaret D.|title=55 years ago: University starts life anew after fire destroys building |date=March 26, 1961|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire, there was debate whether to rebuild from the remains or start from scratch; the remaining structure 
([http://contentdm.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/spec_uihp&amp;CISOPTR=9&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8 photo]) was eventually deemed infeasible to recover and was demolished with [[dynamite]] ([http://contentdm.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/spec_uihp&amp;CISOPTR=10&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=6 photo]).  The original building's steps were saved and currently climb the small hill immediately southeast of the south wing.

In the meantime, classes were held at various sites in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]]; the [[Carnegie library]], the Methodist church, and local lodge halls.  Insurance policies paid $135,000, but the new building cost twice that.  To appease the state legislature, the UI Regents decided to build Morrill Hall first, use it for classrooms, and finance the new administration building over three years.

The new Admin. building was designed by prominent Boise [[architect]] [[John E. Tourtellotte]].  He designed the state's [[Roman Revival]] [[Idaho State Capitol|capitol building]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and other buildings, both public and private. Tourtellotte modeled the new UI structure after the venerable [[Hampton Court Palace]] in England, and construction began in 1907.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://www.ucm.uidaho.edu/default.aspx?pid=86022 About the UI - A Brief UI History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1909 Administration Building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978, at age 69.&lt;ref name =&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years out of office, former U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] spoke outside the main east entrance of the new building on April 9, 1911, on a platform built of [[Palouse]] [[wheat]] ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Roosevel.jpg photo]).

===Hello Walk===
[[File:Hellowalkuniversityofidaho.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Hello Walk.]]

&quot;Hello Walk&quot; is one of the best-known and traveled pathways on the Idaho campus. But more than being surrounded by trees and grass, it navigates through a rich history of statues, landmarks and traditions. It includes Presidential Grove, where historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt and his wife, planted trees; the Spanish War memorial statue who had his hands cut off but reconstructed by a handless sculptor and Administration Lawn that was designed by the same brothers who designed Central Park in New York City.

The walk was named after Alfred Upham, the president of the university in the 1920s. Upham insisted on saying &quot;hello&quot; to all those he passed on his walk from his house â on the site now occupied by the Campus Christian Center â to his office in the Administration Building. He requested that this act of kindness be required of all students and faculty on campus, which is how the walk acquired its name.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Hello Walk is still used, but the hellos that used to be mandatory are now not often vocalized to strangers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081015204110/http://www.uiargonaut.com/content/view/6241/48/ LOST AND FOUND: University of Idaho's traditions have come and gone since its opening], University of Idaho Argonaut (archived from http://www.uiargonaut.com/content/view/6241/48/ the original] on 2008-10-15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idaho Commons===
The Idaho Candlewalk Commons, completed on January 10, 2000, is the heart of campus and contains a food court, copy center, bagel and coffee shop (Einstein's Bagels), Credit Union, and convenience store.  Additionally, there is study space, wireless internet, laptop checkout, and many student services such as the offices of the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI), Academics Assistance, the University of Idaho Writing Center, and Student Support.

With the completion of the Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) at the beginning of the fall semester of 2005, the second phase, the Commons gained classrooms and completed the vision of a common area where students could learn, study, relax and get university services all in one place.

===Student Union Building===
The Student Union Building houses Financial Aid, Admissions, New Student Services, the Registrar's Office, the office of the Graduate &amp; Professional Student Association(GPSA) and student meeting rooms. There is also wireless access, laptops available for check-out, a student computer lab, and a movie theater. This SUB wa the primary student area until the Commons was opened in 2000. The SUB was originally the Blue Bucket Inn, purchased by the UI in 1936.  The UI Bookstore, built in 1989 on a former parking lot, is located directly across the street to the east, formery adjacent to the south.

===ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center===
[[File:Kibbiedomeui.jpg|thumb|250px|Kibbie Dome in 2006]]
UI's multi-purpose &quot;[[Kibbie Dome]]&quot; is the home to Vandal athletics; it is the venue for [[College football|football]], [[College basketball|basketball]], [[tennis]], and indoor track &amp; field. Its Trus-Dek roof system, constructed in 1975, uses natural [[wood]] arches to span {{convert|400|ft|0}} at a height of {{convert|150|ft|0}} over the field's hashmarks. Built when Idaho was a member of the [[Big Sky Conference]], the Kibbie Dome is the smallest stadium (as of December 2010) in Division I [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] football.

Previously on this site was [[Neale Stadium]], which opened in 1937 as an earthen [[horseshoe]] with wooden sideline grandstands. After 32 seasons, its bleachers were condemned for structural inadequacies due to erosion in the summer of 1969.  After an idle 1969 football season, it was destroyed (by suspected [[arson]]) on November 22, 1969. After two years away at nearby [[Rogers Field (Washington State)|Rogers Field]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], the new outdoor &quot;Idaho Stadium&quot; opened on October 9, 1971, with [[concrete]] grandstands; the [[1971 Idaho Vandals football team|1971 Vandals]] responded with a victory over [[Idaho State University|Idaho State]], an 8-3 season,  and the [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] title.

Tartan Turf, similar to [[AstroTurf]], was installed in 1972 with the roll-up mechanism; the arched roof and vertical end-walls were completed in time for the 1975 football home opener on September 27, enclosing the stadium to become the [[Kibbie Dome]]. The [[seating capacity]] is 16,000 for football games, 7,000 for basketball games (in a configuration known as the &quot;Cowan Spectrum&quot; since 2001), and 7,500 for concerts. Its innovative roof won the Outstanding Structural Engineering Achievement award from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] in 1976.

The original Tartan Turf was replaced with AstroTurf in 1990 and lasted until 2007, when it was replaced with &quot;Real Grass Pro,&quot; an infilled synthetic turf (similar to [[FieldTurf]]). In [[2009 Idaho Vandals football team|2009]], the Kibbie Dome began a multi-phase renovation with millions of dollars of improvements, primarily for safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uidaho.edu/kibbie uidaho.edu/kibbie]&lt;/ref&gt; The primary change was the entire west wall; its aged dry plywood panels were replaced with non-flammable [[translucent]] plastic (upper) and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[aluminum]] (lower).  New field-level exits were also installed.  The east wall was replaced in [[2011 Idaho Vandals football team|2011]] and a new press box was built above the north grandstand; the former press box area above the south grandstand was converted to premium seating (Litehouse Center).

===UI Golf Course===
The [[University of Idaho Golf Course|UI Golf Course]] was established in 1933 on the southwest edge of campus, and opened as nine holes in 1937. It was expanded to 18 holes in 1970 and its current clubhouse was built in 1969. Due to its demanding rolling terrain and southwesterly summer winds, the par-72 course's moderate length of {{convert|6637|yd}} from the back tees yields a challenging slope of 135 with a scratch rating of 72.4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://63.240.106.223/natcrsrating/courseTeeInfo.aspx?assocID=572&amp;crsCourseID=872 USGA golf course rating] - accessed 2010-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arboretum and Botanical Garden===
[[File:UofIArboretumGreenery.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Arboretum and Botanical Garden trail and pond.]]
[[File:UIArboretum.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Southern section of Arboretum with view of iconic &quot;Red Barn.&quot;]]
Referred to as &quot;Tree City&quot; or &quot;The Arb&quot; by UI students, the [[Arboretum]] is a {{convert|65|acre|ha|adj=on}} site adjacent to the golf course which features display gardens, ponds, and a variety of trees and plants from [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]].

The original Shattuck Arboretum was conceived in 1910 by Charles H. Shattuck, the head of the forestry department. His efforts gradually turned a treeless slope southwest of the Administration Building into a dense forest grove. The aboretum was named for Shattuck in 1933, two years after his death. Until the late 1960s, this area provided the background for left &amp; center field of the MacLean baseball field, whose infield was displaced by the construction of the new College of Education buildings, which were completed in 1968.

The newer portion of the arboretum complex is south of the Shattuck area, in the valley below the president's residence (1967), along the eastern edge of the [[University of Idaho Golf Course|campus' 18-hole golf course]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uidaho.edu/arboretum/about.html About UI Arboreta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation Student Recreation Center]===
Opened in April 2002, the {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} [http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation Student Recreation Center] boasts a {{convert|55|ft|sing=on}} freestanding [http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/climbing-center climbing wall], as well as a weight training area, cardio, {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|0}} of climbing area, jogging track, and two full-size gyms. The Rec Center [http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/hours hours] are set to meet the schedules of users including students, faculty and staff. The Student Recreation Center offers a number of [http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/wellness/wellness-schedule wellness classes] including zumba, [http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/wellness/wellness-classes/TRX TRX], cycling, gravity, belly dancing and yoga. The planned Phase Two of the project includes adding a swimming pool, but has been delayed due to funding problems.

The recreation center is [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+of+idaho+campus+rec&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=university+of+idaho+campus+rec&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=m&amp;z=17 located] on the corner of Paradise Creek Street and Line Street north of the Theophilus Tower dormitory, an area which formerly housed maintenance buildings.

===UI Library===
The UI Library is the state's largest, with more than 1.4 million books, periodicals, government documents, maps, videorecordings, and special collections.  Included are those for [[Sir Walter Scott]], and many famous Idahoans, including [[Ezra Pound]], [[Vardis Fisher]], [[Psychiana|Frank Bruce Robinson]], and [[Carol Ryrie Brink]] of Moscow.

Directly north of the [[Memorial Gymnasium (University of Idaho)|Memorial Gymnasium]] and built on the former site of tennis courts, the library opened in 1957, relocating from the south wing of the Administration Building. The UI post office station was formerly housed in its lower northwest corner; it was moved to the new UI bookstore in 1990. The UI Library was expanded by 50% in the early 1990s and rededicated in 1994.

===Memorial Gymnasium===
[[File:UI-memorial-gym-moscow-id-us.png|200px|right|thumb|Memorial Gym Tower]]
The [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style [[Memorial Gymnasium (University of Idaho)|Memorial Gymnasium]] is another UI [[Secular icon|icon]], known for its whimisical athletic [[gargoyle]]s perched along the brick building's ledges.  The multi-purpose &quot;Mem Gym&quot; has a modest [[seating capacity]] of only 1,500. Opened in 1928 to honor the Idaho citizens who died in [[World War I]] (1917â18), the heavily [[buttress]]ed  structure was designed by the chairman of the university's architecture department, David C. Lang&lt;ref&gt;[https://admin.xosn.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;ATCLID=1349875 Memorial Gym - University of Idaho Athletics Official Site â GoVandals.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial Gym was the primary venue for men's basketball until the [[Kibbie Dome]] was enclosed in September 1975. The women's team hosted its home games in the gym until 2001, when the Cowan Spectrum (inside the Kibbie Dome) was completed.  The gym is still in active use today as the home court for the women's [[volleyball]] team, and several early season basketball games. It is also used extensively for [[Intramural sports|intramurals]] and open recreation, as well as for [[Reserve Officers Training Corps|ROTC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#M lib.uidaho.edu] - UI Buildings - M - accessed 2010-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The MacLean baseball field was located directly south of the Memorial Gym, until its infield was displaced by the construction of the College of Education building in 1967. The catcher and batter faced southwest (towards the pitcher's mound); the right field line was just south of the gym, running east-west.  The background of left and center field was the Shattuck Arboretum. The new baseball field (Guy Wicks Field) was relocated northwest, to the vast intramural fields near the [[Idaho State Highway 8|Moscow-Pullman Highway]], northwest of the Wallace Complex dormitories.  The batter and catcher now faced southeast, toward campus, an unorthodox configuration resulting in a difficult sun field for the left side of the defense (the recommended alignment is east-northeast).  Due to budget constraints, varsity baseball was dropped following the 1980 season,&lt;ref name=basdro&gt;''[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z5NfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FDEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5789%2C4625804 Lewiston Monrning Tribune]'' - UI drops baseball, but booster group mounts fund drive - 1980-05-13 - p.C1&lt;/ref&gt; but continued for a while as a club sport. MacLean was also the venue for [[college football|football]] until the opening of [[Neale Stadium]] in 1937.

The swim center and physical education building (formerly known as the &quot;Women's Gym&quot;), which both opened in 1970, are adjacent to the south side of the gym.

In 1977, the Memorial Gymnasium was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] after only 49 years.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

===Under the Elms===
Rare [[Camperdown Elm|Camperdown elms]] line the walkway between the Music building, Child Development Center and Administration Building. These &quot;upside-down&quot; trees have been on campus for over 80 years and are among few of their kind in the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest]]. The weeping branches and knotty trunk are formed by being grafted upwards.

===Steam Plant===
Built in 1926, the steam plant provides heat to UI buildings from a single location. Originally designed to burn coal, then oil, then natural gas, the plant was modified in 1986 to burn waste wood chips leftover from local sawmills. The use of wood has significantly reduced the emissions of the plant, as well as cut costs to heat the campus. The plant is shut down twice a year for cleaning and maintenance. As a side benefit of the heat generation, the steam pipes are routed underneath campus walkways and provide clean (and ice free) walkways throughout the [[North Central Idaho|north Idaho]] winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090307223722/http://www.uiargonaut.com/content/view/7298/48 UIâs steam plant heats up=](28 January 2009), [http://www.uiargonaut.com/ the Argonaut] (archived from [http://www.uiargonaut.com/content/view/7298/48 the original] on 2009-03-07).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student housing===
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
Student housing facilities that have students with dependent children include South Hill Apartments and South Hill Vista Apartments.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.uidaho.edu/universityhousing/communities/apartmentfamilyhousing/southhillapartments South Hill Apartments].&quot; University of Idaho. Retrieved on February 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.uidaho.edu/universityhousing/communities/apartmentfamilyhousing/South%20Hill%20Vista%20Apartments South Hill Vista Apartments].&quot; University of Idaho. Retrieved on February 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moscow School District]] serves residents. [[Moscow High School]] is the district's sole traditional high school.

== Student life ==
UI is a rural, residential campus, with four residence hall communities to choose from on campus, as well as 27 housed [[Fraternity|fraternities]] and [[Sorority|sororities]]. On campus residence is currently required for freshmen, and many other upperclassmen choose to live on campus in the Greek system or the residence halls.

Apartments on campus are available for families, married couples, graduate students, law students, and non-traditional students. The &quot;Law Cluster&quot; is a group of apartments reserved for law students, allowing for a community close to campus for law students, facilitating study groups.

===Transportation===
[[File:UI-fountain-moscow-id-us.png|thumb|250px|East entrance to campus (built 2001)&lt;br&gt;at Sweet Ave. &amp; S. Main St.]]
All students are permitted to have cars on campus, which is also served by public transportation. The nearest airport, [[Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport|Pullman-Moscow Regional]], is {{convert|5|mi|km}} west, east of [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]].  Other nearby airports are [[Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport|Lewiston]] (34 miles (55&amp;nbsp;km) south), and [[Spokane International Airport|Spokane International]], {{convert|90|mi|km}} north. The nearest passenger train station ([[Amtrak]]) is in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], and the nearest bus station is in downtown Moscow.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Student organizations===
Many students participate in a wide variety of clubs and organizations. Clubs range anywhere from the sports to faith based, and everything in between. Palousafest is a fair that brings clubs and students together, and is a way for students to find out more about how to get involved with extracurricular activities. The fair is usually the weekend just before the fall semester starts.  The prominent [[literary journal]] [[Fugue (magazine)|Fugue]] is published at the university.

===Fraternity and Sorority Life===
The University of Idaho is home to 17 housed [[Fraternity|fraternities]], 10 housed [[Sorority|sororities]], and 6 [http://www.uidaho.edu/greeklife/chapterinfo/multicultural-greek-chapters multicultural Greek] organizations that make up more than 20% of the student population, and over 44% of the students who live on campus (around 1,800 students). This fraternity and sorority community is unique in that it's one of the few that allow freshmen to move in first semester as a living option, as opposed to waiting until second semester or sophomore year. This system works very well for the University and the students, with the Greeks having the highest GPA for 9 consecutive semesters as of Spring 2011.

==Fight song==

'''Go, Vandals, Go''' is the official [[fight song]] of the University of Idaho.

The song was originally written by J.M. &quot;Morey&quot; O'Donnell, a freshman at Idaho who later became a prominent attorney in the state.  He submitted it for a contest held by the school's student government to choose a new fight song.  Previously, the Vandals had used a variation of ''[[On, Wisconsin]]''' as its fight song.

Most fight songs are hard to sing because of the fast beat used to make them sound spirited.  However, O'Donnell wrote the song almost entirely with [[whole note]]s and [[half note]]s to make it easy for a large football crowd to sing.  He also added a heavy drumbeat to carry the spirit.

For many years, it has been cited as one of the top fight songs in the United States.  For example,  2002, Norm Maves, Jr. of ''[[The Oregonian|The (Portland) Oregonian]]'' described it as &quot;the once and future king of college fight songs, with a fanfare lead-in that could motivate a successful infantry charge.&quot;

'''Go Vandals'''

Came a tribe from the North brave and bold,&lt;br&gt;
Bearing banners of silver and gold,&lt;br&gt;
Tried and true to subdue all their foes,&lt;br&gt;
Go Vandals! Go mighty Vandals!

Go Vandals go,&lt;br&gt;
Fight on with hearts brave and bold,&lt;br&gt;
Foes will fall before your silver and your gold,&lt;br&gt;
The victory cannot be withheld from thee,&lt;br&gt;
So, all bear down for Idaho,&lt;br&gt;
Come on old Vandals, go!

I-D-A-H-O,&lt;br&gt;
Idaho, Idaho, Go! Go! Go!

The victory cannot be withheld from thee,&lt;br&gt;
So, all bear down for Idaho,&lt;br&gt;
Come on old Vandals, go!&lt;br&gt;
Let's go!
