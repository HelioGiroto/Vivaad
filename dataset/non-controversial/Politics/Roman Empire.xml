The '''Roman Empire''' ({{lang-la|&lt;small&gt;IMPERIVM ROMANVM&lt;/small&gt;}}) was the post-[[Roman Republic|Republican]] period of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman civilization]], characterised by an [[autocracy|autocratic]] form of government and large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Roman Empire&quot;, Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 500-year-old [[Roman Republic]], which preceded it, had been destabilized through a series of [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]]. Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire, including [[Julius Caesar]]'s appointment as perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC); the [[Battle of Actium]] ({{Nowrap|2 September}} 31&amp;nbsp;BC); and the granting of the [[honorific]] ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' to [[Octavian]] by the [[Roman Senate]]  ({{Nowrap|16 January}} 27&amp;nbsp;BC).

The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] (&quot;Roman Peace&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pax Romana&quot;. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of [[Trajan]] (98–117 AD). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a [[Crisis of the Third Century|crisis]] that threatened its existence, but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors [[Aurelian]] and [[Diocletian]]. Christians rose to power in the 4th century, during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin West and Greek East]]. After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse of central government in the West]] in the 5th century, the eastern half continued as what would later be known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed, particularly Europe, and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Roman Empire}}
{{See also|Campaign history of the Roman military}}

Rome had begun annexing [[Roman province|provinces]] in the 3rd century BC, four centuries before reaching its greatest territorial extent, and in that sense was an &quot;empire&quot; while still governed as a republic.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Kelly, ''The Roman Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 4ff.; Claude Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics in the Early Roman Empire'' (University of Michigan Press, 1991, originally published in French 1988), pp. 1, 15; [[T. Corey Brennan]], ''The Praetorship in the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 605 ''et passim''; [[Clifford Ando]], &quot;From Republic to Empire,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Republican provinces were administered by former [[Roman consul|consuls]] and [[praetor]]s, who had been elected to one-year terms and held ''[[imperium]]'', &quot;right of command&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The amassing of disproportionate wealth and military power by a few men through their provincial commands was a major factor in the transition from republic to imperial autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics in the Early Roman Empire'', pp. 1, 15; Olivier Hekster and Ted Kaizer, preface to''Frontiers in the Roman World. Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Durham, 16–19 April 2009)'' (Brill, 2011), p. viii; [[Andrew Lintott]], ''The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 114; W. Eder, &quot;The Augustan Principate as Binding Link,&quot; in ''Between Republic and Empire'' (University of California Press, 1993), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the position of power held by the emperor was expressed as ''imperium''.&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson, &quot;''Fines provinciae'',&quot; in ''Frontiers in the Roman World,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word is the origin of English &quot;empire,&quot; a meaning it began to acquire only later in Rome's history.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, &quot;''Fines provinciae'',&quot; in ''Frontiers in the Roman World,'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'' (early 1st century AD)]]
As the first emperor, Augustus took the official position that he had saved the Republic, and carefully framed his powers within [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|republican constitutional principles]]. He rejected titles that Romans associated with monarchy, and instead referred to himself as the ''[[princeps]]'', &quot;leading citizen&quot;. [[Consul]]s continued to be elected, [[tribune|tribunes of the people]] continued to put forth legislation, and senators still debated in the [[curia]]. It was Augustus, however, who established the precedent that the emperor controlled the final decisions, backed up by military force.

The reign of Augustus, lasting more than 40 years, was portrayed in [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]] and art as a new &quot;[[Golden Age]].&quot; Augustus laid out an enduring ideological foundation for the three centuries of the Empire known as the [[Principate]] (27 BC–284 AD), the first 200 years of which is traditionally regarded as the [[Pax Romana]]. But even during the Pax Romana, numerous uprisings were put down, as in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Jewish–Roman wars|Judea]].

The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] lasted for four more emperors—[[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], [[Claudius]], and [[Nero]]—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn [[Year of Four Emperors]], from which [[Vespasian]] emerged as victor.

Vespasian became the founder of the brief [[Flavian dynasty]], to be followed by the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]] which produced the &quot;[[Five Good Emperors]]&quot;: [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and the philosophically inclined [[Marcus Aurelius]]. In the view of the Greek historian [[Dio Cassius]], a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor [[Commodus]] in 180 AD marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;—a famous comment which has led some historians, notably [[Edward Gibbon]], to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

In 212, during the reign of [[Caracalla]], [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. But despite this gesture of universality, the [[Severan dynasty]] was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], a period of invasions, civil strife, economic depression, and plague.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, P., The World of Late Antiquity, London 1971, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In defining [[periodization|historical epochs]], this crisis is sometimes viewed as marking the transition from [[Classical Antiquity]] to [[Late Antiquity]]. The emaciated illusion of the old Republic was sacrificed for the sake of imposing order: [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284–305) brought the Empire back from the brink, but declined the role of ''princeps'' and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as ''dominus'', &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworth, ''How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower'' (Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 405–415.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Absolute monarchy|autocratic absolutism]] that resulted is the [[Dominate]], which endured till the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476. Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of [[early Christianity|Christianity]], the [[Diocletianic Persecution|&quot;Great&quot; Persecution]].

[[File:Solidus with Roma and Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|left|Rome and Constantinople [[personification|personified]], clasping hands on the reverse of a gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' from the mid-4th century AD]]
The unity of the Roman Empire was from this point a fiction, as graphically revealed by Diocletian's division of authority among four &quot;co-emperors&quot;, the [[Tetrarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David. The Roman Empire at Bay. 296–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Order was shaken again soon after, but was restored by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who became the first emperor to [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|convert to Christianity]], and who established [[Constantinople]] as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the [[Constantinian dynasty|Constantinian]] and [[Valentinian dynasty|Valentinian dynasties]], the Empire was divided along an east-west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], who attempted to restore [[Religion in ancient Rome|Classical Roman]] and [[Hellenistic religion]], only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. [[Theodosius&amp;nbsp;I]], the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official state religion.&lt;ref&gt;Chester G. Starr, ''A History of the Ancient World, Second Edition.'' Oxford University Press, 1974. pp. 670–678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 4th century, the Empire began to disintegrate as [[barbarian]]s from the north overwhelmed the control of Christian Rome. Most chronologies place the end of the Western empire in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus Augustus]] was forced to abdicate to the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warlord [[Odoacer]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov. ''Asimov's Chronology of the World.'' Harper Collins, 1989. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire in the East—known today as the [[Byzantine Empire]], but referred to in its time as the &quot;Roman Empire&quot; or by various other names—ended in 1453 with the death of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine&amp;nbsp;XI]] and the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, and the only empire to have encompassed territories in northern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''The Roman Empire,'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin phrase ''imperium sine fine'' (&quot;empire without end&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics in the Early Roman Empire'', p. 29; translated as &quot;power without end&quot; in Pat Southern, ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'' (Routledge, 2001), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In [[Vergil]]'s epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]],'' limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Aeneid'' 1.278; Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics,'' p. 29; David J. Mattingly, ''Imperialism, Power, and Identity: Experiencing the Roman Empire'' (Princeton University Press, 2011), p. 15; G. Moretti, &quot;The Other World and the 'Antipodes': The Myth of Unknown Countries between Antiquity and the Renaissance,&quot; in ''The Classical Tradition and the Americas: European Images of the Americas'' (Walter de Gruyter, 1993), p. 257; Southern, ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prudentius]] (348–413) in particular Christianizes the theme in his poetry, as noted by Marc Mastrangelo, ''The Roman Self in Late Antiquity: Prudentius and the Poetics of the Soul'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), pp. 73, 203. [[St. Augustine]], however, distinguished between the secular and eternal &quot;Rome&quot; in ''[[De Civitate Dei|The City of God]].'' See also [[J. Rufus Fears]], &quot;The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology,&quot; ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.1 (1981), p. 136 ''et passim'', on how Classical Roman ideology influenced Christian Imperial doctrine; Peter Fibiger Bang, &quot;The King of Kings: Universal Hegemony, Imperial Power, and a New Comparative History of Rome,&quot; in ''The Roman Empire in Context: Historical and Comparative Perspectives'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011); and the Greek concept of globalism ''([[ecumene|oikouménē]]).''&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD, when Roman dominion in Europe, Africa and Asia was strengthened. During the reign of Augustus, a &quot;global map of the known world&quot; was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the composition of the most comprehensive work on [[political geography]] that survives from antiquity, the ''Geography'' of the [[Pontus|Pontic]] Greek writer [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics,'' pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; When Augustus died, the commemorative account of his achievements ''([[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]])'' prominently featured the geographical cataloging of peoples and places under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics,'' pp. 9, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Geography, the [[Roman census|census]], and the meticulous keeping of written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Space, Geography, and Politics,'' pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris, &quot;Trade,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the classical historian Christopher Kelly has described it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the empire stretched from [[Hadrian's Wall]] in drizzle-soaked [[northern England]] to the sun-baked banks of the [[Euphrates]] in [[Syria]]; from the great [[Rhine]]-[[Danube]] river system, which snaked across the fertile, flat lands of Europe from the [[Low Countries]] to the [[Black Sea]], to the rich plains of the [[North Africa]]n coast and the luxuriant gash of the [[Nile Valley]] in [[Egypt]]. The empire completely circled the [[Mediterranean]] … referred to by its conquerors as ''mare nostrum''—'our sea'.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''The Roman Empire'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders ''(fines)'' were marked, and the frontiers ''([[limes]])'' patrolled.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine,'' pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Hekster and Ted Kaizer, preface to ''Frontiers in the Roman World.

==Languages==
{{Main|History of Latin|History of Greek}}
The language of the Romans was [[Latin]], which [[Vergil]] emphasizes as a source of Roman unity and [[mos maiorum|tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Aeneid'' 12.834 and 837: &quot;they will keep the speech ''(sermo)'' and ''[[mos maiorum|mores]]'' of their fathers … and I will make them all [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] with one mode of expression ''(uno ore,'' literally &quot;with one mouth&quot;), in a speech attributed to Rome’s supreme deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; Bruno Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; translated by James Clackson, in ''A Companion to the Latin Language'' (Blackwell, 2011), pp. 549, 563; J.N. Adams, &quot;''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,&quot; ''Classical Quarterly'' 53.1 (2003), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the time of [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222–235), the [[Birth registration in Ancient Rome|birth certificates]] and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, &quot;''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,&quot; pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin was the language of the law courts in the West and of the military throughout the Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 554, 556.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 549; Charles Freeman, ''The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World'' (New York: Penguin, 1999), pp. 389–433.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] observed that Romans preferred for Latin to be adopted ''per pacem societatis'', through a [[social contract|social pact]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'' 19.7.18, as cited by Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy contrasts with that of [[Alexander the Great]], who aimed to impose [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] throughout his empire as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 549, citing [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' 47.6.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Alexander’s conquests, [[koine Greek]] had become the [[lingua franca]] around the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''A Greek Roman Empire: Power and Belief under Theodosius&amp;nbsp;II (408–450)'' (University of California Press, 2006), p. 279; Warren Treadgold, &quot;A History of the Byzantine State and Society&quot; (Stanford University Press, 1997), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;linguistic frontier&quot; dividing the Latin West and the Greek East passed through the [[Balkan peninsula]], creating a bilateral [[monolingualism]] in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P.Ryl. I 61.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|left|A 5th-century [[papyrus]] showing a parallel Latin-Greek text of a speech by [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[In Catilinam]]'' 2.15, [[Rylands Papyri|P.Ryl.]] I 61 &quot;[[recto]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Romans who received an elite education studied Greek as a [[literary language]], and most men of the governing classes could speak Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 550–552.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] emperors encouraged high standards of correct Latin ''(Latinitas)'', a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as [[Classical Latin]], and favored Latin for conducting official business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochette p. 552&quot;&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius]] tried to limit the use of Greek, and on occasion revoked the citizenship of those who lacked Latin, but even in the Senate he drew on his own bilingualism in communicating with Greek-speaking ambassadors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochette p. 552&quot;/&gt; [[Suetonius]] quotes him as referring to &quot;our two languages,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Claudius'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and the employment of two imperial secretaries, one for Greek and one Latin, dates to his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 553; Lee I. Levine, ''Jerusalem: Portrait of the City in the Second Temple Period (538 B.C.E. – 70 C.E.)'' (Jewish Publication Society, 2002), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern empire, laws and official documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 553–554.&lt;/ref&gt; The everyday interpenetration of the two languages is indicated by bilingual inscriptions, which sometimes even switch back and forth between Greek and Latin. The epitaph of a Greek-speaking soldier, for instance, might be written primarily in Greek, with his rank and unit in the Roman army expressed in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 556; Adams, &quot;''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,&quot; p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; After all freeborn inhabitants of the empire were universally [[wikt:enfranchise|enfranchised]] in 212 AD, a great number of Roman citizens would have lacked Latin, though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge, and Latin remained a marker of &quot;Romanness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, &quot;''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,&quot; pp. 185–186, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other reforms, the emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284–305) sought to renew the authority of Latin, and the Greek expression ἡ κρατοῦσα διάλεκτος ''(hē kratousa dialektos)'' attests to the continuing status of Latin as &quot;the language of power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar [[Libanius]] (4th century) regarded Latin as causing a decline in the quality of Greek rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 560; A.H.M. Jones, ''The Decline of the Ancient World'' (Longmanns, 1966), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 6th century, the emperor [[Justinian]] engaged in a quixotic effort to reassert the status of Latin as the language of law, even though in his time Latin no longer held any currency as a living language in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local languages===
[[File:Inscription Theatre Leptis Magna Libya.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Bilingual Latin-Punic inscription at the theatre in [[Leptis Magna]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] (present-day Libya)]]
References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages other than Greek and Latin, particularly in Egypt, where [[Coptic language|Coptic]] predominated, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman [[jurist]]s also show a concern for local languages such as [[Punic language|Punic]], [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], and [[Aramaic]] in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Africa (Roman province)|province of Africa]], Punic was used for legends on coins during the time of [[Tiberius]] (1st century AD), and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Miles, &quot;Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power,&quot; in ''Experiencing Power: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 200), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the importance of Latin in gaining access to the ruling power structure caused the rapid extinction of inscriptions in scripts that had been used to represent local languages on the [[Iberian peninsula]] ([[Roman Spain]]) and in [[Gaul]]. Among other aspects of a distinctive [[Gallo-Roman culture]] was the creation of Gallo-Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, &quot;Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power,&quot;pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the written use of Latin had replaced [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and [[Oscan language|Oscan]] by the end of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, &quot;Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power,&quot; p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominance of Latin among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, &quot;Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power,&quot; pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babatha|Babatha Archive]] is a suggestive example of multilingualism in the Empire. These [[papyri]], named for a Jewish woman in the [[Arabia (Roman province)|province of Arabia]] and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and Latin influences; a petition to the [[Roman governor]], however, was written in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; pp. 553–555.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narbonensis|Mediterranean Gaul]] had become trilingual (Greek, Latin, Gaulish) by the mid-1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]] as quoted by [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'' 15.1.63, ''trilingues quod et graece loquantur et latine et gallice''; Edgar C. Polomé, &quot;The Linguistic Situation in the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire,&quot; ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II (De Gruyter, 1983), p. 527; Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'' (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic legacy===
In the Western Empire, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as [[Vulgar Latin]], gradually replaced [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Italic languages|Italic]] languages that were related to it by a shared [[Proto-Indo-European|Indo-European origin]]. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, &quot;Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire,&quot; p. 550; Stefan Zimmer, &quot;Indo-European,&quot; in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 961; Leonard A. Curchin, &quot;Literacy in the Roman Provinces: Qualitative and Quantitative Data from Central Spain,&quot; ''American Journal of Philology'' 116.3 (1995), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basque language|Basque]], not an Indo-European language, survived in the region of the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Karmele Rotaetxe, &quot;Basque as a Literary Language,&quot; in ''A Comparative History of Literatures in the Iberian Peninsula'' (John Benjamins, 2010), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; After the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally into branches that became the [[Romance languages]], such as [[History of Spanish|Spanish]], [[History of the Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[History of French|French]], [[History of Italian|Italian]] and [[History of Romanian|Romanian]]. As an international language of learning and literature, Latin itself continued as an active medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with [[Renaissance humanism]] up to the 17th century, and for [[legal Latin|law]] and the [[Church Latin|Roman Catholic Church]] to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Waquet, ''Latin, Or, The Empire of the Sign: From the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Century'' (Verso, 2001; originally published 1998 in French), pp. 1–2; Kristian Jensen, &quot;The Humanist Reform of Latin and Latin Teaching,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1996, 2003), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Greek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire, linguistic distribution in the East was more complex. A Greek-speaking majority lived in the [[Greek peninsula]] and [[Greek islands|islands]], western [[Anatolia]], major cities, and some coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Greek and Latin, the [[Thracian language|language of the Thracians]] was of Indo-European origin, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia such as [[Galatian language|Galatian]], [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], [[Pisidian language|Pisidian]], and [[Cappadocian language|Cappadocian]], attested by Imperial-era inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, &quot;Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power,&quot; p. 58; Treadwell, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Afroasiatic languages]]—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia—were never replaced by Greek. [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] soldiers even used their [[Palmyrene dialect|dialect of Aramaic]] for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, &quot;''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,&quot;  p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The international use of Greek, however, was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
[[File:Pompeii family feast painting Naples.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A multigenerational banquet depicted on a wall painting from [[Pompeii]] (1st century AD)]]

The Roman Empire was remarkably multicultural, with &quot;a rather astonishing cohesive capacity&quot; to create a sense of shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples within its political system over a long span of time.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Peachin, introduction to ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman attention to creating public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as [[Forum (Roman)|forums]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheaters]], [[circus (building)|racetracks]] and [[thermae|baths]]—helped foster a sense of &quot;Romanness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peachin, introduction to ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman society had multiple, overlapping social hierarchies that modern concepts of &quot;[[social class|class]]&quot; in English may not represent accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Peachin, introduction to ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' p. 9, citing particularly [[Géza Alföldy]], ''Römische Sozialgeschichte'' (first published 1975) on &quot;the innate, potent, and widely institutionalized hierarchic character of Roman society,&quot; and pp. 21–22 (note 45 on the problems of &quot;class&quot; as a term).&lt;/ref&gt; The two decades of civil war from which Augustus rose to sole power left traditional society in Rome in a state of confusion and upheaval,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey and Richard Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'' (University of California Press, 1987), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not effect an immediate [[redistribution of wealth]] and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes, a peak was merely added to the social pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos F. Noreña,''Imperial Ideals in the Roman West: Representation, Circulation, Power'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal relationships—[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]], friendship ''(amicitia)'', family, [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]]—continued to influence the workings of politics and government, as they had in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Peachin, introduction to ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Nero]], however, it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen, or an [[equestrian order|equestrian]] who exercised greater power than a senator.&lt;ref&gt;Aloys Winterling, ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German), pp. 11, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blurring or diffusion of the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased [[social mobility]] under the Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Saller, ''Personal Patronage under the Early Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982, 2002), pp. 123, 176, 183 ''et passim''; Anne Duncan, ''Performance and Identity in the Classical World'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; both upward and downward, to an extent that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyer Reinhold]], ''Studies in Classical History and Society'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 25ff. and 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Saller, &quot;Status and patronage&quot;, ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire, A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and [[confraternity|confraternities]] (''[[collegium|collegia]]'' and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|sodalitates]]'') formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Peachin, introduction to ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' pp. 17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; performing arts troupes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], &quot;Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 73 (1983), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[burial society|burial societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Carroll, ''Spirits of the Dead: Roman Funerary Commemoration in Western Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
{{Main|Status in Roman legal system|Roman citizenship }}
According to the [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]], the essential distinction in the Roman &quot;[[legal personality|law of persons]]&quot; was that all human beings were either free ''(liberi)'' or slaves ''(servi)''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004), p. 14; [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], ''Institutiones'' 1.9 = ''Digest'' 1.5.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of free persons might be further defined by their citizenship. In the early Empire, only a relatively limited number of men held full rights of Roman citizenship that allowed them to vote, run for office, and enter state priesthoods. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the ''[[ius Latinum]],'' &quot;Latin right&quot;), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by those who lacked citizenship. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, held status as ''[[peregrinus (Roman)|peregrini]]'', non-Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook of Family Law,'' pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 212 AD, by means of the edict known as the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', the emperor [[Caracalla]] extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism would have required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that had distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women as legal entities====
{{Main|Women in ancient Rome}}
Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ''ex duobus civibus Romanis natos'' (&quot;children born of two Roman citizens&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The ''civis'' (&quot;citizen&quot;) stands in explicit contrast to a ''[[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrina]]'', a foreign or non-Roman woman: [[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268; Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''. In the form of legal marriage called ''conubium,'' the father's legal status determined the child's, but ''conubium'' required that both spouses be free citizens. A soldier, for instance, was banned from marrying while in service, but if he formed a long-term union with a local woman while stationed in the provinces, he could marry her legally after he was discharged, and any children they had would be considered the offspring of citizens—in effect granting the woman retroactive citizenship. The ban was in place from the time of Augustus until it was rescinded by [[Septimius Severus]] in 197 AD. See Sara Elise Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers (13 B.C.–A.D. 235): Law and Family in the Imperial Army'' (Brill, 2001), p. 2, and Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman woman kept her own [[Roman naming conventions|family name]] ''(nomen)'' for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, &quot;The Roman Family,&quot; in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze young girl reading CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statuette (1st century AD) of a young woman reading]]
The archaic form of [[manus marriage|''manus'' marriage]] in which the woman had been subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140–141; J.P. Sullivan, &quot;Martial's Sexual Attitudes,&quot; ''Philologus'' 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, &quot;The Roman Family,&quot; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband had no legal power over her.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was a point of pride to be a &quot;one-man woman&quot; ''(univira)'' who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Divorce|divorce]], nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage: ''Iusti Coniuges'' from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258–259, 500–502 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, '' A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Chapter IV; Yan Thomas, &quot;The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law,&quot; in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman mother's right to own property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Severy, ''Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Empire'' (Routledge, 2002; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, [[Leges Iuliae|moral legislation]] attempted to regulate the conduct of women as a means of promoting &quot;[[family values]]&quot;. [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|Adultery]], which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized,&lt;ref&gt;Severy, ''Augustus and the Family,'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defined broadly as an illicit sex act ''([[stuprum]])'' that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband.&lt;ref&gt;That is, a [[double standard]] was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute, slave, or person of marginalized status. See Thomas McGinn, &quot;Concubinage and the Lex Iulia on Adultery,&quot; ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 121 (1991), p. 342; [[Martha C. Nussbaum]], &quot;The Incomplete Feminism of Musonius Rufus, Platonist, Stoic, and Roman,&quot; in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 305, noting that custom &quot;allowed much latitude for personal negotiation and gradual social change&quot;; [[Elaine Fantham]], &quot;''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome,&quot; in ''Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 124, citing [[Papinian]], ''De adulteriis'' I and [[Modestinus]], ''Liber Regularum'' I.

Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business,&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law,'' p. 461; W.V. Harris, &quot;Trade,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt; including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honor women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the [[Arch of the Sergii]] was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honored, and the largest building in the forum at [[Pompeii]] was funded by [[Eumachia]], a priestess of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret L.

====Slaves and the law====
{{Main|Slavery in ancient Rome}}

At the time of Augustus, as many as 35 percent of the people in [[Roman Italy|Italy]] were slaves,&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; making Rome one of five historical &quot;slave societies&quot; in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;The others are [[Slavery in ancient Greece|ancient Athens]], and in the modern era [[Slavery in Brazil|Brazil]], the [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|Caribbean]], and the [[Slavery in the United States|United States]]; Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants, in addition to the majority of slaves who provided trained or unskilled labor in households or workplaces. [[Roman agriculture|Agriculture]] and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves made up on average an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the population, sparse in [[Roman Egypt]] but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries would have affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;W.V. Harris, &quot;Demography, Geography and the Sources of Roman Slaves,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89 (1999) 62–75, especially p. 65 on Roman Egypt. For background on pre-Roman slavery in some areas brought under provincial rule, see Timothy Taylor, &quot;Believing the Ancients: Quantitative and Qualitative Dimensions of Slavery and the Slave Trade in Later Prehistoric Eurasia,&quot; ''World Archaeology'' 33.1 (2001) 27–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarcofago avvocato Valerius Petrnianus-optimized.jpg|thumb|Slave holding writing tablets for his master ([[relief]] from a 4th-century sarcophagus)]]
Laws pertaining to slavery were &quot;extremely intricate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook of Family Law,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Roman law, slaves were considered property and had no [[Person (law)|legal personhood]]. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual exploitation]], torture, and [[summary execution]]. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped, since rape could be committed only against people who were free; a slave's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the [[Lex Aquilia|Aquilian Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 314; Jane F. Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'' (Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called ''[[Marriage in ancient Rome|conubium]]'', but their unions were sometimes recognized, and if both were freed they could marry.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Law,'' pp. 31, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Servile Wars]] of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Fuhrmann, ''Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 21–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, a slave could not own property,&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law,'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual account or fund ''(peculium)'' that he could use as if it were his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and cooperation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the ''peculium'' he managed to other slaves of his household.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gamauf, &quot;Slaves Doing Business: The Role of Roman Law in the Economy of a Roman Household,&quot; in ''European Review of History'' 16.3 (2009) 331–346.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'', pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes in ancient Rome]] were often slaves.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law'', p. 288ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The burgeoning trade in [[eunuch]] slaves in the late 1st century AD prompted legislation that prohibited the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Castration and circumcision|castration]] of a slave against his will &quot;for lust or gain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ra'anan Abusch, &quot;CIrcumcision and Castration under Roman Law in the Early Empire,&quot; in ''The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite'' (Brandeis University Press, 2003), pp. 77–78; Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman slavery was not based on &quot;[[Race (human classification)|race]]&quot; in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook of Family Law,'' p. 15; Stefan Goodwin, ''Africa in Europe: Antiquity into the Age of Global Expansion'' (Lexington Books, 2009), vol. 1, p. 41 (&quot;Roman slavery was a nonracist and fluid system&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of Republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the [[Roman Greece|conquest of Greece]] brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves into Rome. Slaves were also traded in markets, and sometimes sold by [[Cilician pirates|pirates]]. [[Child abandonment|Infant abandonment]] and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;Demography, Geography and the Sources of Roman Slaves,&quot; p. 62 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vernae'', by contrast, were &quot;homegrown&quot; slaves born to female slaves within the urban household or on a country estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his ''vernae'' faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of his ''familia'', the family household, and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, &quot;Children in the Roman ''Familia'',&quot; in ''The Family in Ancient Rome&quot; New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986, 1992), pp. 186–188, 190; K.R. Bradley, &quot;On the Roman Slave Supply and Slavebreeding,&quot; in,''Classical Slavery'' (Frank Cass, 1987), p. 72, and ''Slavery and Society at Rome'', p. 34, 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly skilled or educated slaves might accumulate a large enough ''peculium'' to justify their freedom, or be [[manumission|manumitted]] for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law ''([[Lex Fufia Caninia]])'' limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedmen====
[[File:DM Tiberius Claudius Chryseros.jpg|thumb|[[Urn#Cremation urns|Cinerary urn]] for the freedman Tiberius Claudius Chryseros and two women, probably his wife and daughter]]
Rome differed from [[Greek city-states]] in allowing freed slaves to become citizens. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed not only passive freedom from ownership, but active political freedom ''(libertas)'', including the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan, 1998, 2002), pp. 23, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave who had acquired ''libertas'' was a ''libertus'' (&quot;freed person,&quot; [[grammatical gender|feminine]] ''liberta'') in relation to his former master, who then became his patron ''([[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronus]])'': the two parties continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. As a social class generally, freed slaves were ''libertini'', though later writers used the terms ''libertus'' and ''libertinus'' interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''The Freedman in the Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 36; Adolf Berger, entry on ''libertus'', ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philological Society, 1953, 1991), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''libertinus'' was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a [[Augustales|priestly role]] in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult of the emperor]]. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that [[Hadrian]] limited their participation by law.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, entry on ''libertinus'', ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'', p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.

The rise of successful freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by [[:Commons:Category:Liberti and libertae in Ancient Roman inscriptions|inscriptions throughout the Empire]], and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at [[Pompeii]], such as the [[House of the Vettii]]. The excesses of ''[[nouveau riche]]'' freedmen were satirized in the character of [[Trimalchio]] in the ''[[Satyricon]]'' by [[Petronius]], who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.

===Census rank===
{{See also|Senate of the Roman Empire|Equestrian order|Decurion (administrative)}}
The Latin word ''ordo'' (plural ''ordines'') refers to a social distinction that is translated variously into English as &quot;class, order, rank,&quot; none of which is exact. One purpose of the [[Roman census]] was to determine the ''ordo'' to which an individual belonged. The two highest ''ordines'' in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, the [[decurion (administrative)|decurions]], also known as ''[[curiales]]'' (Greek ''bouleutai''), were the top governing ''ordo'' of an individual city.

[[File:0 Sarcophage d'Acilia - Pal. Massimo alle Terme.JPG|thumb|left|Fragment of a sarcophagus depicting [[Gordian III]] and senators (3rd century)]]
&quot;Senator&quot; was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|executive magistrate]]. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million [[sestertii]], as determined by the [[Roman census|census]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, &quot;Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, pp. 217–218; [[Ronald Syme]], ''Provincial At Rome: and Rome and the Balkans 80 BC-AD 14'' (University of Exeter Press, 1999), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Nero made large gifts of money to a number of senators from old families who had become too impoverished to qualify. Not all men who qualified for the ''ordo senatorius'' chose to take a Senate seat, which required [[Domicile (law)|legal domicile]] at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,&quot; pp. 215, 221–222;  Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 88. The standard complement of 600 was flexible; twenty [[quaestor]]s, for instance, held office each year and were thus admitted to the Senate regardless of whether there were &quot;open&quot; seats.&lt;/ref&gt; A senator's son belonged to the ''ordo senatorius'', but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate itself. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards: he was prohibited, for instance, from marrying a freedwoman or fighting in the arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, Empire and City, p. 88&quot;&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Nero, senators were still primarily from Rome and other parts of Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added in the time of Vespasian.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,&quot; pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; The first senator from the most eastern province, [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], was admitted under Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;His name was Tiberius Claudius Gordianus; Eck, &quot;Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,&quot; p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland ''(patria)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, Empire and City, p. 88&quot;/&gt;

Senators had an aura of prestige and were the traditional governing class who rose through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', the political career track, but equestrians of the Empire often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome's early days, ''equites'' or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors (the &quot;public horse&quot;), but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;The relation of the equestrian order to the &quot;public horse&quot; and Roman cavalry parades and demonstrations (such as the ''[[Lusus Troiae]]'') is complex, but those who participated in the latter seem, for instance, to have been the ''equites'' who were accorded the high-status (and quite limited) seating at the theatre by the ''[[Lex Roscia theatralis]]''. Senators could not possess the &quot;public horse.&quot; See [[T.P. Wiseman]], &quot;The Definition of ''Eques Romanus'',&quot; ''Historia'' 19.1 (1970) 67–83, especially pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, &quot;The Definition of ''Eques Romanus'',&quot; pp. 71–72, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at [[Cadiz]] and [[Padua]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Gades, in Roman Spain, and Patavium, in the Celtic north of Italy, were atypically wealthy cities, and having 500 equestrians in one city was unusual. [[Strabo]] 3.169, 5.213; Wiseman, &quot;The Definition of ''Eques Romanus'',&quot; pp. 75–76, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Equestrians rose through a military career track ''([[tres militiae]])'' to become highly placed [[prefect]]s and [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]]s within the Imperial administration.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fear, &quot;War and Society,&quot; in ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Rome from the Late Repblic to the Late Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), vol. 2, pp. 214–215; Julian Bennett, ''Trajan: Optimus Princeps'' (Indiana University Press, 1997, 2001, 2nd ed.), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the first three centuries of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later [[European nobility]], a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188; Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the ''ordines'' brought distinction and privileges, but also a number of responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services ''(munera)'', rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Liebeschuetz, &quot;The End of the Ancient City,&quot; in ''The City in Late Antiquity'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' (&quot;worth, esteem&quot;) that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as ''[[vir illustris]]'', &quot;illustrious man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 90, calls them &quot;status-appellations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The appellation ''clarissimus'' (Greek ''lamprotatos'') was used to designate the ''dignitas'' of certain senators and their immediate family, including women.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Grades&quot; of equestrian status proliferated. Those in Imperial service were ranked by pay grade (''sexagenarius'', 60,000 sesterces per annum; ''centenarius,'' 100,000; ''ducenarius'', 200,000). The title ''eminentissimus'', &quot;most eminent&quot; (Greek ''exochôtatos'') was reserved for equestrians who had been [[Praetorian prefect]]s. The higher equestrian officials in general were ''perfectissimi'', &quot;most distinguished&quot; (Greek ''diasêmotatoi''), the lower merely ''egregii'', &quot;outstanding&quot; (Greek ''kratistos'').&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City,&quot; p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unequal justice====
[[File:Museum of Sousse - Mosaics 2 detail.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Condemned man attacked by a leopard in the arena (3rd-century mosaic from Tunisia)]]
As the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honors ''(honestiores)'' and those who were humbler folk ''(humiliores)''. In general, ''honestiores'' were the members of the three higher &quot;orders,&quot; along with certain military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Koenraad Verboven, &quot;The Associative Order: Status and Ethos among Roman Businessmen in Late Republic and Early Empire,&quot; ''Athenaeum'' 95 (2007), p. 870–72; Dennis P. Kehoe, &quot;Law and Social Formation in the Roman Empire,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority over other citizens affirmed, particularly within the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, &quot;Law and Social Formation in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 153; .Judith Perkins, &quot;Early Christian and Judicial Bodies,&quot; in (Walter de Gruyter, 2009), pp. 245–246 (particularly on the effect of the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]''); Garrett G. Fagan, &quot;Violence in Roman Social Relations,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations,'' p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative &quot;worth&quot; ''(dignitas)'' of the defendant: an ''honestior'' could pay a fine when convicted of a crime for which an ''humilior'' might receive a [[scourging]].&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, &quot;Law and Social Formation in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Execution, which had been an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic even in a capital case,&lt;ref&gt;Judy E. Gaughan, ''Murder Was Not a Crime: Homocide and Power in the Roman Republic'' (University of Texas Press, 2010), p. 91 ''et passim''; Gordon P. Kelly, ''A History of Exile in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 8 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; could be quick and relatively painless for the Imperial citizen considered &quot;more honorable,&quot; while those deemed inferior might suffer the kinds of torture and prolonged death previously reserved for slaves, such as [[crucifixion]] and [[damnatio ad bestias|condemnation to the beasts]] as a [[#Recreation and spectacles|spectacle in the arena]].&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Coleman, &quot;Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythology Enactments,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 80 (1990), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as ''honestiores'', especially if they declined to fulfill the religious aspects of their civic responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, &quot;Law and Social Formation in the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and military==
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Jerash BW 12.JPG|thumbnail|upright=1.2|Forum of Gerasa ([[Jerash]] in present-day [[Jordan]]), with columns marking a covered walkway ''([[stoa]])'' for vendor stalls, and a semicircular space for public speaking]]

The three major elements of the Imperial Roman state were the central government, the military, and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;Yann Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army,'' translated by Raphael Bate (Routledge, 2000, originally published 1989 in French), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the military mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens (after 212 AD, all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire), the agricultural fields that fed them, and religious sites.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army,'' pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Without modern instruments of either mass communication or mass destruction, the Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to impose their rule through force alone. Cooperation with local power elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions by supporting one faction over another: in the view of [[Plutarch]], &quot;it was discord between factions within cities that led to the loss of self-governance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' Moralia 813c and 814c; [[Clifford Ando]], &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), pp. 181–182; Edward N. Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976, 1979), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence were an incentive to remain in good standing with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman government was thus [[limited government|limited]], but efficient in its use of the resources available to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the [[Plebeian Tribune|tribunes of the people]] and the authority of the [[Roman Censors|censors]] to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 354&quot;&gt;Abbott, 354&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as [[Pontifex Maximus]], and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 345&quot;&gt;Abbott, 345&lt;/ref&gt; While these functions were clearly defined during the [[Principate]], the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the [[Dominate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 341&quot;&gt;Abbott, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], &quot;Emperors at Work,&quot; in ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East: Government, Society, and Culture in the Roman Empire'' (University of North Carolina Press 2004), vol. 2, pp. 3–22, especially pp. 4 and 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University History, 2000), p. 195ff.&lt;/ref&gt; After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council ''(consilium)'' became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater [[Open government|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; pp. 205–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the [[Antonine dynasty]], equestrians played an increasingly important role in the ''consilium.''&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; pp. 202–203, 205, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. [[Plotina]] exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to the emperor by others might be gained at the daily reception ''(salutatio)'', a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century, as urban centers decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City, Augustus to Julian,&quot; p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates ''([[legatus|legati]])'' to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, &quot;The Emperor and His Advisors,&quot; p. 215; Winterling, ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favor with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor ''([[Sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Roman Army|first=Adrian |last=Goldsworthy|chapter =The Life of a Roman Soldier|page=80|isbn=0-500-05124-0|year=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis.  Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority in order to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the ''[[donativum]]'', a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|300px|The Roman empire under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117–138) showing the location of the Roman legions deployed in AD 125]]
{{Main|Imperial Roman army|Structural history of the Roman military}}
The soldiers of the Imperial Roman army were professionals who volunteered for a 25-year [[tour of duty]]. The transition to a professional military had begun during the late Republic, and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of [[conscripts]] had exercised their responsibilities as citizens in defending the homeland in a campaign against a specific threat. For Imperial Rome, the military was a full-time career in itself.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Edmondson, &quot;Dynamic Arenas: Gladiatorial Presentations in the City of Rome and the Construction of Roman Society during the Early Empire,&quot; in ''Roman Theater and Society'' (University of Michigan Press, 1996), pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary mission of the Roman military of the early empire was to preserve the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier J. Hekster, &quot;Fighting for Rome: The Emperor as a Military Leader,&quot; in ''Impact of the Roman Army (200 BC–AD 476)'' (Brill, 2007), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major divisions of the military were:
* the garrison at Rome, which includes the Praetorians and ''[[vigiles]]'' functioning as police and firefighters;
* the provincial army, comprising the [[Roman legions]] and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces ''([[auxilia]]'');
* the [[Roman navy|navy]].

The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of cultural exchange and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] known as &quot;Romanization,&quot; particularly in regard to politics, the economy, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army,'' p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Roman military comes from a wide range of sources: Greek and Roman literary texts; coins with military themes; [[papyri]] preserving military documents; monuments such as [[Trajan's Column]] and [[triumphal arch]]es, which feature artistic depictions of both fighting men and military machines; the archaeology of military burials, battle sites, and camps; and inscriptions, including [[Roman military diploma|military diplomas]], epitaphs, and dedications.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army,'' pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the legion, down to the [[hobnail]] pattern on the soles of army boots.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Roth, &quot;The Size and Organization of the Roman Imperial Legion,&quot; ''Historia'' 43.3 (1994), p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; A legion was organized into ten [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], each of which comprised six [[centuria|centuries]], with a century further made up of ten squads ''([[contubernium|contubernia]])''; the exact size of the Imperial legion, which is most likely to have been determined by [[military logistics|logistics]], has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, &quot;The Size and Organization of the Roman Imperial Legion,&quot; pp. 361–362 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 9, Germanic tribes wiped out three full legions in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. This disastrous event reduced the number of the legions to 25. The total of the legions would later be increased again and for the next 300 years always be a little above or below 30.&lt;ref&gt;''The complete Roman army'' by Adrian Goldsworthy, 2005 chapter ''The Army of the Principate'', p.183; ISBN 0-500-05124-0&lt;/ref&gt; The army had about 300,000 soldiers in the 1st century, and under 400,000 in the 2nd, &quot;significantly smaller&quot; than the collective armed forces of the territories it conquered. No more than 2 percent of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires : State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Praetorian GuardSoldiers basrelief med.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Praetorian guards (1st century AD [[relief]])]]
Augustus also created the [[Praetorian Guard]]: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.&lt;ref&gt;''Rome and her enemies'' published by Osprey, 2005 part 3 ''Early Empire 27BC&amp;nbsp;— AD 235'', chapter 9 ''The Romans'', section ''Remuneration'', p.183; ISBN 978-1-84603-336-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxilia]]'' were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with [[Roman citizenship]], also extended to their sons. According to [[Tacitus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' IV.5&lt;/ref&gt; there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries. The ''auxilia'' thus amounted to around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy (2003) 51&lt;/ref&gt; Roman cavalry, for instance, were primarily from Celtic and Germanic areas, or [[Roman Spain]]. Several aspects of training and equipment, such as the four-horned saddle, derived from the Celts, as noted by [[Arrian]] and indicated by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Connolly, “A Reconstruction of a Roman Saddle,” ''Britannia'' 17 (1986) 343–355; Peter Connolly and Carol van Driel Murray, “The Roman Cavalry Saddle,” ''Britannia'' 22 (1991) 33–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman navy]] (Latin: ''classis,'' &quot;fleet&quot;) not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions, but also helped in the protection of the [[limes|frontier]]s along the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. Another of its duties was the protection of the crucial maritime trade routes against the threat of pirates. It patrolled the whole of the Mediterranean, parts of the [[Atlantic|North Atlantic]] coasts, and the [[Black Sea]]. Nevertheless the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.&lt;ref&gt;''The complete Roman army'' by Adrian Goldsworthy 2003, chapter ''After Service'', p.114; ISBN 0-500-05124-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial government===
{{Main|Roman province}}
{{Provinces of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Pula Arena aerial 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Pula Arena]] in [[Croatia]] is one of the largest and most intact of the remaining [[Roman amphitheatres]]]]
An annexed territory became a province in a three-step process: making a register of cities, taking a census of the population, and surveying the land.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; pp. 177–179. Most government records that are preserved come from Roman Egypt, where the climate preserved the papyri.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials each year to govern outside Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 179&quot;&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these officials were the &quot;[[Roman governor]]s&quot;, as they are called in English: either [[executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|magistrates elected at Rome]] who in the name of the [[SPQR|Roman people]] governed [[senatorial province]]s; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their ''imperium'' on behalf of the emperor in [[imperial province|provinces excluded from senatorial control]], most notably [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 179. The exclusion of Egypt from the senatorial provinces dates to the rise of Octavian before he became Augustus: Egypt had been the stronghold of his last opposition, [[Mark Antony]] and his ally [[Cleopatra]].&lt;/ref&gt; A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 180&quot;&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants ''([[apparitor]]es)'', including [[lictor]]s, heralds, messengers, [[scriba (ancient Rome)|scribes]], and bodyguards; [[legatus|legates]], both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends, ranging in age and experience, who accompanied him unofficially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 180&quot;/&gt;

Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 179&quot;/&gt; Separating fiscal responsibility from law and administration was a reform of the Imperial era. Under the Republic, provincial governors and [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]] could exploit local populations for personal gain more freely.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; pp. 179, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Equestrian [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]]s, whose authority was originally &quot;extra-judicial and extra-constitutional,&quot; managed both state-owned property and the vast personal property of the emperor ''([[privatus|res privata]])''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 180&quot;/&gt; Because Roman government officials were few in number, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity, such as a procurator or a military officer, including [[centurion]]s down to the lowly ''[[stationarius (Roman military)|stationarii]]'' or military police.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 180; Christopher J. Fuhrmann, ''Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 197, 214, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===

Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5 percent of [[Roman economy#Gross domestic product|gross product]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith Hopkins 2009 p. 183&quot;/&gt; The typical tax rate paid by individuals ranged from 2 to 5 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 187&quot;&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The tax code was &quot;bewildering&quot; in its complicated system of [[direct taxation|direct]] and [[indirect taxes]], some paid in cash and some [[barter|in kind]]. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as [[fishery|fisheries]] or [[salt evaporation pond]]s; they might be in effect for a limited time.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; pp. 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 185; Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In-kind taxes were accepted from less-[[monetization|monetized]] areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nile river02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Personification of the Nile River and his children, from the [[Serapeum|Temple of Serapis and Isis]] in Rome (1st century AD)]]
The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a [[poll tax]] and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 187&quot;/&gt; Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 186&quot;&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household to appear before the presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 186&quot;/&gt;

A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the ''portoria'', [[customs]] and tolls on imports and exports, including among provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 187&quot;/&gt; Special taxes were levied on the slave trade. Toward the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4 percent tax on the sale of slaves,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 55.31.4.&lt;/ref&gt; which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 13.31.2.&lt;/ref&gt; An owner who manumitted a slave paid a &quot;freedom tax&quot;, calcuated at 5 percent of value.&lt;ref&gt;This was the ''vicesima libertatis,'' &quot;the twentieth for freedom&quot;; Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inheritance tax]] of 5 percent was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone but members of their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from a 1 percent sales tax from auctions went toward the veterans' pension fund ''(aerarium militare)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando p. 187&quot;/&gt;

Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equaled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the &quot;superrich,&quot; but in the later period, the [[tax resistance|resistance]] of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins p. 184&quot;/&gt;

===Roman law===
{{Main|Roman law}}
Roman courts held [[original jurisdiction]] over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey and Richard Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'' (University of California Press, 1987), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it was Roman policy to respect the ''mos regionis'' (&quot;regional tradition&quot; or &quot;law of the land&quot;) and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey and Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'', p. 110; [[Clifford Ando]], &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ''[[ius gentium]]'', the &quot;law of nations&quot; or [[international law]] regarded as common and customary among all human communities.&lt;ref&gt;Adda B. Bozeman, ''Politics and Culture in International History from the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age'' (Transaction Publishers, 2010, 2nd ed., originally published 1960 by Princeton University Press), pp. 208–20&lt;/ref&gt; If the particulars of provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard [[Appellate court|appeals]], and the emperor held final authority to render a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey and Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'', p. 110; Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; pp. 184–185. This practice was established in the Republic; see for instance the case of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus#Contrebian water rights|Contrebian water rights]] heard by G. Valerius Flaccus as governor of [[Hispania]] in the 90s–80s BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis, and [[private property rights]] may have been a novelty of the Roman era, particularly among [[Celts|Celtic peoples]]. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite who found their new privileges as citizens to be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey and Saller, ''The Roman Empire,'' pp. 110–111.&lt;!--there is an additional citation here regarding Celtic property rights that I'm still locating--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The pervasive exercise of Roman law throughout Western Europe led to its enormous influence on the Western legal tradition, reflected by the continued use of [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin legal terminology]] in modern law.

==Architecture and engineering==
{{Main|Ancient Roman architecture|Roman engineering}}
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Construction on the Flavian Amphitheatre, more commonly known as the [[Colosseum]], began during the reign of Vespasian]]
The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the [[arch]] and the [[dome]]. Even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs &quot;Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, De Arch. Book 1, preface. section 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman roads]] are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even after the collapse of the central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.

[[Roman bridges]] were among the first large and lasting bridges, built from stone with the arch as the basic structure. Most utilized concrete as well. The largest Roman bridge was [[Trajan's bridge]] over the lower Danube, constructed by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]], which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built both in terms of overall and span length.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'', [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9008022/Apollodorus-Of-Damascus Apollodorus of Damascus], &quot;''Greek engineer and architect who worked primarily for the Roman emperor Trajan.''&quot;&lt;br&gt;[[George Sarton]] (1936), &quot;The Unity and Diversity of the Mediterranean World&quot;, ''Osiris'' '''2''': 406-463 [430]&lt;br/&gt;{{citation|title=Apollodorus of Damascus and Trajan's Column: From Tradition to Project|author=Giuliana Calcani, Maamoun Abdulkarim|publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider|year=2003|isbn=88-8265-233-5|page=11|quote=''...focusing on the brilliant architect Apollodorus of Damascus.

The Romans built many [[dams]] for water collection, such as the [[Subiaco Dams]], two of which fed the [[Anio Novus]], one of the largest aqueducts of [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Smith|1970|pp=60f.}}; {{harnvb|Smith|1971|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Schnitter|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built 72 dams just on the [[Iberian peninsula]], and many more are known across the Empire, some still in use. Several [[earthen dam]]s are known from [[Roman Britain]], including a well-preserved example from [[Longovicium]] ([[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]]).

[[File:Pont du Gard Oct 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pont du Gard]] aqueduct, which crosses the [[Gardon River]] in southern France, is on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s]]
The Romans constructed numerous [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]. A surviving treatise by [[Frontinus]], who served as ''curator aquarum'' (water commissioner) under Nerva, reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply. Raised stone channels on a precise [[grade (slope)|grade]] relied on [[gravity]] to carry water from mountain springs along raised stone channels. After the water passed through the aqueduct, it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths, [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|toilets]], or industrial sites.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Fiona &quot;The Usborne Internet Linked Encyclopedia of the Roman World&quot;, page 80. Usborne Publishing 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The main aqueducts in the city of Rome were the [[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Aqua Marcia]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Joan &quot;The Romans&quot;, page 34. Macdonald Educational Ltd. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120&amp;nbsp;km away along a sinuous route of more than 336&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;J. Crow 2007 &quot;Earth, walls and water in Late Antique Constantinople&quot; in ''Technology in Transition AD 300–650'' in ed. L.Lavan, E.Zanini &amp; A. Sarantis Brill, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]], and to a technological standard that was not to be equaled until modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Greene 2000, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire. Some sites, such as [[Las Medulas]] in northwest Spain, had at least seven major channels entering the [[minehead]].&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/803/&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites such as [[Dolaucothi]] in [[South Wales]] was fed by at least five [[leat]]s, all leading to reservoirs and tanks or [[cistern]]s high above the present opencast.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R. F. J. and Bird, D. G., Roman gold-mining in north-west Spain, II: Workings on the Rio Duerna, Journal of Roman Studies 62 (1972): 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt; The water was used for [[hydraulic mining]], where streams or waves of water are released onto the hillside, first to reveal any gold-bearing ore, and then to work the ore itself. [[Pliny the Elder]] provides a description of gold mining in Book 33 of his encyclopedic ''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]'', some details of which have been confirmed by [[classical archaeology|archaeology]].

[[Insulated glazing]] (or &quot;double glazing&quot;) was used in the construction of [[thermae|public baths]]. Elite housing in cooler climates might have [[hypocaust]]s, a form of central heating.

Another original process was [[glassblowing]], which started in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and spread rapidly throughout the Empire. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later [[steam engine]], when [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]] built the [[aeolipile]].&lt;ref&gt;With the crank and connecting rod system, all elements for constructing a steam engine (invented in 1712) — [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]]'s [[aeolipile]] (generating steam power), the [[Pneumatic cylinder|cylinder]] and [[piston]] (in metal force pumps), non-return [[valves]] (in water pumps), [[gearing]] (in water mills and clocks) — were known in Roman times.{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=156, fn. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient world, a city was viewed as a place that fostered civilization by being &quot;properly designed, ordered, and adorned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus undertook a vast building program in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed the new imperial ideology, and [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|reorganized the city]] into neighborhoods ''([[vicus|vici]])'' administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 4ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the [[Campus Martius]], an open area outside the city center that in early times had been devoted to equestrian sports and physical training for youth. The Altar of Augustan Peace ''([[Ara Pacis Augustae]])'' was located there, as was [[Obelisk of Montecitorio|an obelisk]] imported from Egypt that formed the pointer ''([[gnomon]])'' of a [[Solarium Augusti|giant sundial]]. With its public gardens, the Campus became one of the most attractive places in the city to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos,'' pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

City planning and urban lifestyles had been influenced by the Greeks from an early period,&lt;ref&gt;John E. Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), pp. 23ff. and 244&lt;/ref&gt; and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[Aphrodisias]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Gerasa]] altered some aspects of city planning and architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;Rubina Raja, ''Urban Development and Regional Identity in the Eastern Roman Provinces 50 BC–AD 250'' (Museum Tusculanum Press, 2012), with conclusions pp. 215–218; Daniel Sperber, ''The City in Roman Palestine'' (Oxford University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centers with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as ''[[oppidum|oppida]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City,'' pp. 252–253; Brenda Longfellow, ''Roman Imperialism and Civic Patronage: Form, Meaning and Ideology in Monumental Fountain Complexes'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 2. Julius Caesar first applied the Latin word ''oppidum'' to this type of settlement, and even called [[Avaricum]] ([[Bourges]], France), a center of the [[Bituriges]], an ''urbs'', &quot;city.&quot; Archaeology indicates that ''oppida'' were centers of religion, trade (including import/export), and industrial production, walled for the purposes of defense, but they may not have been inhabited by concentrated populations year-round: see D.W. Harding, ''The Archaeology of Celtic Art'' (Routledge, 2007), pp. 211–212; John Collis, &quot;'Celtic' Oppida,&quot; in ''A Comparative Study of Thirty City-state Cultures'' (Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 2000), pp. 229–238; ''Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State: The Evolution of Complex Social Systems in '' (Cambridge University Press, 1995, 1999), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'' p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The network of cities throughout the Empire (''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', ''[[civitas|civitates]]'' or in Greek terms ''[[polis|poleis]]'') was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City, Augustus to Julian,&quot; p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Romans of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were encouraged by imperial propaganda to &quot;inculcate the habits of peacetime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Aeneid'' 6.852; Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; As the classicist [[Clifford Ando]] has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the cultural [[wikt:appurtenance|appurtenances]] popularly associated with imperial culture—[[Religion in ancient Rome|public cult]] and its [[ludi|games]] and [[epulones|civic banquets]], competitions for artists, speakers, and athletes, as well as the funding of the great majority of public buildings and public display of art—were financed by private individuals, whose expenditures in this regard helped to justify their economic power and legal and provincial privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even the [[Christian polemic]]ist [[Tertullian]] declared that the world of the late 2nd century was more orderly and well-cultivated than in earlier times: &quot;Everywhere there are houses, everywhere people, everywhere the ''[[res publica]]'', the commonwealth, everywhere life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De anima'' 30.3 ''(ubique domus, ubique populus, ubique respublica, ubique uita)'', as cited and framed by Ando, &quot;The Administration of the Provinces,&quot; p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of cities and civic life in the 4th century, when the wealthy classes were unable or disinclined to support public works, was one sign of the Empire's imminent dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, &quot;Empire and City, Augustus to Julian,&quot;, p. 76ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ostia-Toilets.JPG|thumb|left|Public toilets ''(latrinae)'' from [[Ostia Antica]]]]
In the city of Rome, most people lived in multistory apartment buildings ''([[insulae]])'' that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths ''([[thermae]])'', toilets that were flushed with running water ''(latrinae)'', conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains ''([[nymphaeum|nymphea]])'' delivering fresh water,&lt;ref&gt;Longfellow, ''Roman Imperialism and Civic Patronage,'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and large-scale entertainments such as [[chariot races]] and [[gladiator|gladiator combat]]—were aimed primarily at the common people who lived in the ''insulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Mark Wilson ''Principles of Roman Architecture.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.

The public baths served hygienic, social and cultural functions.&lt;ref&gt;Harry B. Evans, ''Water Distribution in Ancient Rome'' (University of Michigan Press, 1994, 1997), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Bathing was the focus of daily socializing in the late afternoon before dinner.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, &quot;Socializing at the Baths,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with varying amenities that might include an [[palaestra|exercise and weight-training room]], [[sudatorium|sauna]], [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] spa (where oils were massaged into the skin and scraped from the body with a [[strigil]]), [[sphaeristerium|ball court]], or outdoor swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, &quot;The Genesis of the Roman Public Bath: Recent Approaches and Future Directions,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105.3 (2001), p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Baths had [[hypocaust]] heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels that circulated warmth.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, &quot;The Genesis of the Roman Public Bath,&quot; p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed nude bathing was not unusual in the early Empire, though some baths may have offered separate facilities or hours for men and women, and in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Bowen Ward, &quot;Women in Roman Baths,&quot; ''Harvard Theological Review'' 85.2 (1992) 125–147, especially pp. 137, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians were advised to go to the baths for health and cleanliness, not pleasure,&lt;ref&gt;Ward, &quot;Women in Roman Baths,&quot; pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; but to avoid the games ''([[ludi]])'', which were part of [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] they considered &quot;pagan&quot;. Tertullian says that otherwise Christians not only availed themselves of the baths, but participated fully in commerce and society.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 42, as cited by Roy Bowen Ward, &quot;Women in Roman Baths,&quot; ''Harvard Theological Review'' 85.2 (1992), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ricostruzione del giardino della casa dei vetii di pompei (mostra al giardino di boboli, 2007) 01.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed peristyle garden based on the [[House of the Vettii]]]]
Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses, a townhouse ''([[domus]],'' plural ''domūs)'' and at least one luxury home ''([[Roman villa|villa]])'' outside the city. The ''domus'' was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath ''(balneum)'',&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, &quot;The Genesis of the Roman Public Bath,&quot; p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not a place to retreat from public life.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.-A.D. 250: Ritual, Space, and Decoration'' (University of California Press, 1992), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some neighborhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos,'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the center of family religious rites, containing a [[lararium|shrine]] and the [[imagines|images of family ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy,'' pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops ''([[taberna|tabernae]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy,'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a kitchen garden, or windowboxes in the ''insulae'', townhouses typically enclosed a [[peristyle]] garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'', pp. 144, 147; Clarke, ''The House of Roman Italy'', pp. 12, 17, 22ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The villa by contrast was an escape from the bustle of the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances the civilized pursuit of intellectual and artistic interests ''([[otium]])'' with an appreciation of nature and the agricultural cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine K. Gazda, introduction to ''Roman Art in the Private Sphere: Architecture and Décor of the Domus, Villa, and Insula'' (University of Michigan Press, 1991, 1994), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It might be located on a working estate, or in a &quot;resort town&quot; situated on the seacoast, such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].

The programme of urban renewal under Augustus, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as 1 million people, was accompanied by a nostalgia for rural life expressed in the arts. Poetry praised the idealized lives of farmers and shepherds. The interiors of houses were often decorated with painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and animals, especially birds and marine life, rendered accurately enough that modern scholars can sometimes identify them by species.&lt;ref&gt;See various articles in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'', edited by Wilhemina Feemster Jashemski and Frederick G. Meyer (Cambridge University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The Augustan poet [[Horace]] gently satirized the dichotomy of urban and rural values in his fable of the city mouse and the country mouse, which has often been retold as a children's story.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Satire'' 2.6; Niklas Holzberg, ''The Ancient Fable: An Introduction'' (Indiana University Press, 2002, originally published 2001 in German), p. 35; Smith Palmer Bovie, introduction to ''Horace. Satires and Epistles'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more practical level, the central government took an active interest in supporting [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing food was the top priority of land use.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey, &quot;The Land,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger farms ''([[latifundium|latifundia]])'' achieved an [[economy of scale]] that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Small farmers benefited from more local markets in towns and trade centers. Agricultural techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]] were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole ''(annona)'' to citizens who registered for it.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33 kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], north Africa, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191, reckoning that the surplus of wheat from the province of Egypt alone could meet and exceed the needs of the city of Rome and the provincial armies.&lt;/ref&gt; The dole cost at least 15 percent of state revenues,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes,&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], &quot;The Census in the First Century B.C.&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 59 (1969), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompei - House of Julia Felix - 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|upright|Bread stall, from a Pompeiian wall painting]]
The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed both the emperor's position as universal benefactor, and the right of all citizens to share in &quot;the fruits of conquest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''annona'', public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist [[Juvenal]], however, saw &quot;[[bread and circuses]]&quot; ''(panem et circenses)'' as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Keane, ''Figuring Genre in Roman Satire'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 36; Eckhart Köhne, &quot;Bread and Circuses: The Politics of Entertainment,&quot; in ''Gladiators and Caesars: The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome'' (University of California Press, 2000), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The public has long since cast off its cares: the people that once bestowed commands, consulships, legions and all else, now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things: bread and circuses.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 10.77–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Food and dining===
{{Main|Ancient Roman cuisine|Grain supply to the city of Rome|Ancient Rome and wine}}
Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal [[brazier]] could be used for rudimentary cookery.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), pp. 144, 178; Kathryn Hinds, ''Everyday Life in the Roman Empire'' (Marshall Cavendish, 2010), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls ''([[taberna]]e, cauponae, [[popina]]e, [[thermopolium|thermopolia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 136ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carryout]] and restaurant dining were for the lower classes; [[fine dining]] could be sought only at private dinner parties in {{nowrap|well-to-do}} houses with a [[chef]] ''(archimagirus)'' and trained kitchen staff,&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Cooks and Cookbooks,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; or at banquets hosted by social clubs ''([[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Faas, ''Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 1994, 2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequenting taverns, where prostitutes sometimes worked, was among the moral failings that louche emperors and other public figures might be accused of.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people would have consumed at least 70 percent of their daily [[calorie]]s in the form of [[cereal]]s and [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garnsey, &quot;The Land,&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; Grains included several varieties of [[wheat]],&lt;ref&gt;Including [[emmer]], [[Taxonomy of wheat#Early taxonomy|rivet wheat]], [[einkorn wheat|einkorn]], [[spelt]], and common wheat ''([[Triticum aestivum]]'': &quot;Foodstuffs,&quot; in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'' (Harvard University Press, 1999), pp. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the less desirable [[barley]], [[millet]], and [[oats]].&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, &quot;The Land,&quot; ''CAH'' 11, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] names varieties of legumes such as the [[Chickpea#History|Venus pea]],&lt;ref&gt;Flint-Hamilton, &quot;Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome,&quot; p. 373; Edwards, &quot;Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria'',&quot; p. 257. Legumes included [[lentil]], [[chickpea]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[broad bean]], [[garden pea]], and [[grass pea]].&lt;/ref&gt; and dried legumes were stockpiled in case of famine.&lt;ref&gt;Flint-Hamilton, &quot;Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome,&quot; pp. 374–376.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Puls'' ([[pottage]]) was considered the aboriginal food of the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 19.83–84; Emily Gowers, ''The Loaded Table: Representation of Food in Roman Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003), p. 17; Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic grain pottage could be elaborated with chopped vegetables, bits of meat, cheese, or herbs to produce dishes similar to [[polenta]] or [[risotto]].&lt;ref&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Julian stew&quot; ''(Pultes Iulianae)'' was made from [[spelt]] wheat to which was added two kinds of [[ground meat]], [[Piper (genus)|pepper]], [[lovage]], [[fennel]], and a wine [[reduction (cooking)|reduction]]; according to tradition, it was eaten by the soldiers of Julius Caesar and was a &quot;quintessential Roman dish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Edwards, &quot;Philology and Cuisine in ''De Re Coquinaria'',&quot; ''American Journal of Philology'' 122.2 (2001), pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem ''[[Moretum]]'' describes a &quot;[[ploughman's lunch]]&quot;, a [[flatbread]] prepared on a griddle and topped with cheese and a [[pesto]]-like preparation, somewhat similar to [[pizza]] or [[focaccia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Field, ''The Italian Baker: The Classic Tastes of the Italian Countryside'' (Random House, 1985, 2011), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban populations and the military preferred to consume their grain in the form of bread.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, &quot;The Land,&quot; ''CAH'' 11, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; Mills and commercial ovens were usually combined in a bakery complex.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower classes ate coarse brown bread made from [[emmer wheat|emmer]] or barley. Fine white loaves were leavened by [[yeast|wild yeasts]] and [[sourdough starter|sourdough cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly B.

[[File:Baeckerei pompeji kampanien italien.jpg|thumb|Mill and bakery complex at Pompeii]]
The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as [[Galen]] (2nd century AD), whose treatises included one ''On Barley Soup''. Views on nutrition were influenced by schools of thought such as [[humoral theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Grant, ''Galen on Food and Diet'' (Routledge, 2000), pp. 7, 11 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leafy greens]] and [[herbs]] were eaten as [[salad]]s with [[vinaigrette|vinegar dressing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooked vegetables such as [[beet]]s, [[leek]]s, and [[gourd]]s were prepared with sauces as first courses or served with bread as a simple meal.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Cured [[olive]]s were available in wide variety even to those on a limited budget.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Truffle]]s and [[edible mushroom|wild mushrooms]], while not everyday fare, were perhaps more commonly foraged than today.&lt;ref&gt;Faas, ''Around the Roman Table,'' pp. 236–239.&lt;/ref&gt; Provinces exported regional [[dried fruit]]s such as [[Caria]]n figs and Theban dates,&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; and fruit trees from the East were propagated throughout the Western empire: the cherry from [[Pontus]] (present-day Turkey); peach ''(persica)'' from [[Persia]] (Iran), along with the lemon and other citrus; the apricot from [[Armenia (Roman province)|Armenia]]; the &quot;[[Damascus|Damascan]]&quot; or [[damson plum]] from [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]; and what the Romans called the &quot;Punic apple&quot;, the [[pomegranate]] from North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bowe, ''Gardens of the Roman World'' p. 49; Phyllis Pray Bober, ''Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 337; C.

Locally available seasonings included garden herbs, [[cumin]], [[coriander]], and [[juniper berries]].&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Pepper was so vital to the cuisine that ornamental pots ''([[piperatorium|piperatoria]])'' were created to hold it. Other imported spices were [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]], and the [[silphium]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], a type of pungent [[ferula|fennel]] that was over-harvested into extinction during the reign of Nero, after which time it was replaced with ''laserpicium'', [[asafoetida]] exported from present-day Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 19.39; Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] estimated that Romans spent 100 million [[sesterces]] a year on spices and perfumes from India, China, and the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Foods and condiments of all kinds were sold at ''[[macellum|macella]]'', the Roman equivalent of shopping malls, and at marketplaces throughout the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'', pp. 207–208 ''et passim''; Seo, &quot;Food and Drink, Roman,&quot; p. 198, and &quot;Cooks and Cookbooks,&quot; p. 299, in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In upperclass households, the evening meal ''([[cena]])'' had important social functions.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, &quot;On Food and the Body,&quot; p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room ''([[triclinium]])'', often with a view of the peristyle garden. Women could dine with men, and a prohibition on wine-drinking by women in early Rome seems not to have been observed from the late Republic onward. On at least some occasions, children attended, so they could acquire social skills.&lt;ref&gt;As depicted for instance in the Pompeiian wall painting of a [[:Commons:File:Pompeii family feast painting Naples.jpg|family banquet]].

Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes,&lt;ref&gt;Veronika E. Grimm, &quot;On Food and the Body,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire,'' p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; and the most famous description of a Roman meal is probably [[Cena Trimalchionis|Trimalchio's dinner party]] in the ''Satyricon'', a fictional extravaganza that bears little resemblance to reality even among the most wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, &quot;On Food and the Body,&quot; p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Martial describes serving a more plausible dinner, beginning with the ''gustatio'' (&quot;tasting&quot; or &quot;appetizer&quot;), which was a composed salad of [[Malvaceae|mallow leaves]], lettuce, chopped leeks, [[mentha|mint]], [[arugula]], [[mackerel]] garnished with [[rue]], sliced eggs, and marinated sow udder. The main course was succulent cuts of [[goat meat|kid]], beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fresh fruit and vintage wine.&lt;ref&gt;Joan P. Alcock, ''Food in the Ancient World'' (Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin expression for a full-course dinner was ''ab ovo usque mala'', &quot;from the egg to the apples,&quot; equivalent to the English &quot;[[from soup to nuts]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Donahue, ''The Roman Community at Table during the Principate'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004, 2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for &quot;bread and circuses&quot;, he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the ''circenses'', events held in the entertainment venue called a ''[[circus (building)|circus]]'' in Latin. The largest such venue in Rome was the [[Circus Maximus]], the setting of [[horse racing|horse races]], [[chariot races]], the equestrian [[Lusus Troiae|Troy Game]], staged beast hunts ''([[venatio|venationes]])'', athletic contests, [[gladiator|gladiator combat]], and [[historical reenactment]]s. From earliest times, several [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] had featured games ''([[ludi]])'', primarily horse and chariot races ''(ludi circenses)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Although their entertainment value tended to overshadow ritual significance, the races remained part of archaic religious observances that pertained to agriculture, [[initiation ritual|initiation]], and the cycle of birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Consualia]] and the [[October Horse]] sacrifice: John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Manuel des Institutions Romaines'' (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; &quot;Purificazione,&quot; in ''Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum'' (''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae|LIMC]]'', 2004), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus, public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year; by the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the number of days had expanded to 135.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'' that ended at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, ''Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph'' (Brill, 1970), pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the [[Roman amphitheater|amphitheatre]], which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue, and [[stadium]]. Greek-style athletics included [[Stadion (running race)|footraces]], [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxing]], [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]], and the [[Pankration|pancratium]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Dodge, &quot;Amusing the Masses: Buildings for Entertainment and Leisure in the Roman World,&quot; in ''Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic displays, such as the mock sea battle ''([[naumachia]])'' and a form of &quot;water ballet&quot;, were presented in engineered pools.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, &quot;Amusing the Masses,&quot; pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt; State-supported [[#Performing arts|theatrical events]] ''([[ludi scaenici]])'' took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres, or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an ''[[Odeon (building)|odeum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, &quot;Amusing the Masses,&quot; pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman, &quot;Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythological Enactments,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 80 (1990), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, &quot;Entertainers in the Roman Empire,&quot; in ''Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire'', p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait,'' pp. 237, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, &quot;Dynamic Arenas,&quot; pp. 73–74, 106,  ''et passim''; Roland Auguet, ''Cruelty and Civilization: The Roman Games'' (Routledge, 1972, 1994), p. 54; John McClelland, ''Body and Mind: Sport in Europe from the Roman Empire to the Renaissance'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd could call for an outcome by booing and cheering, but the emperor had the final say.

The Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with [[Funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome#sacrifice|sacrifices]] in which select captive warriors were forced to fight to expiate the deaths of noble Romans.  Some of the earliest [[List of Roman gladiator types|styles of gladiator fighting]] had ethnic designations such as &quot;[[Thraex|Thracian]]&quot; or &quot;Gallic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome'' (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 59; Potter, &quot;Entertainers in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The staged combats were considered ''munera'', &quot;services, offerings, benefactions&quot;, initially distinct from the festival games ''(ludi)''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 59; Potter, &quot;Entertainers in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his 40-year reign, Augustus presented eight gladiator shows in which a total of 10,000 men fought, as well as 26 staged beast hunts that resulted in the deaths of 3,500 animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cassio Dio 54.2.2; ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' 22.1, 3; Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 49; Edmondson, &quot;Dynamic Arenas,&quot; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the opening of the Colosseum, the emperor [[Titus]] presented [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|100 days of arena events]], with 3,000 gladiators competing on a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 66.25; Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 55; Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses,'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and even graffiti drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves, convicts, or free volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' p. 55; Potter, &quot;Entertainers in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 307; McClelland, ''Body and Mind,'' p. 66, citing also [[Marcus Junkelmann]].&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ''noxii'' were convicts sentenced to the arena with no training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate [[retributive justice]] for the crimes they had committed.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, &quot;Fatal Charades,&quot; pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt; These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as reenactments of [[Greek mythology|myths]], and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate [[stagecraft|stage machinery]] to create [[special effects]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 12.2; Coleman, &quot;Fatal Charades,&quot; pp. 44–73; Edmondson, &quot;Dynamic Arenas,&quot; p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De spectaculis'' 12; Edwards, ''Death in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 59–60; Dodge, &quot;Amusing the Masses,&quot; p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The singular ''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]]'', &quot;play, game, sport, training,&quot; had a wide range of meanings such as &quot;word play,&quot; &quot;theatrical performance,&quot; &quot;board game,&quot; &quot;primary school,&quot; and even &quot;gladiator training school&quot; (as in ''[[Ludus Magnus]]'', the largest such training camp at Rome).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Latin Dictionary'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprint), pp. 1048–1049; Thomas N. Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), pp. 5, 143, ''et passim''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Activities for children and young people included [[Hoop rolling#Ancient Rome and Byzantium|hoop rolling]] and [[knucklebones]] (''astragali'' or &quot;jacks&quot;). The [[sarcophagi]] of children often show them playing games. Girls had [[doll]]s, typically 15–16 cm tall with jointed limbs, made of materials such as wood, [[terracotta]], and especially [[Ivory carving|bone and ivory]].&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball games include [[Trigon (game)|trigon]], which required dexterity, and [[harpastum]], a rougher sport.&lt;ref&gt;Walton Brooks McDaniel, &quot;Some Passages concerning Ball-Games,&quot; ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 37 (1906), pp. 122–123, 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pet]]s appear often on children's memorials and in literature, including birds, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, rabbits and geese.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy,'' pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casale Bikini modified.jpg|thumb|left|So-called &quot;bikini girls&quot; mosaic from the Villa del Casale, Sicily]]
After adolescence, most physical training for males was of a military nature. The [[Campus Martius]] originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to [[Plutarch]], conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned [[Quinquennial Neronia|Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games]] in the Greek manner.&lt;ref&gt;Emiel Eyben, ''Restless Youth in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1977, 1993), pp. 79–82, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers, and a rare few as [[gladiatrix|female gladiators]]. The famous &quot;bikini girls&quot; mosaic shows young women engaging in apparatus routines that might be compared to [[rhythmic gymnastics]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholars are divided in their relative emphasis on the athletic and dance elements of these exercises: H. Lee, &quot;Athletics and the Bikini Girls from Piazza Armerina,&quot; ''Stadion'' 10 (1984) 45–75, sees them as gymnasts, while M. Torelli, &quot;Piazza Armerina: Note di iconologia&quot;, in ''La Villa romana del Casale di Piazza Armerina,'' edited by G. Rizza (Catania, 1988), p. 152, thinks they are dancers at the games. Summarized by Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, ''Mosaics of the Greek and Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in general were encouraged to maintain their health through activities such as playing ball, swimming, walking, reading aloud (as a breathing exercise), riding in vehicles, and travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ellis Hanson, &quot;The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome,&quot; in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome'' (Université de Nantes, 1991), pp. 260, 264, particularly citing the ''Gynecology'' of [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Game of 12 Lines Board - Aphrodisias.jpg|thumb|Stone game board from [[Aphrodisias]]: boards could also be made of wood, with deluxe versions in costly materials such as ivory; game pieces or counters were bone, glass, or polished stone, and might be colored or have markings or images&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Austin, &quot;Roman Board Games II,&quot; ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4.11 (1935), pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
People of all ages played [[board game]]s pitting two players against each other, including ''[[ludus latrunculorum|latrunculi]]'' (&quot;Raiders&quot;), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and ''[[Ludus duodecim scriptorum|XII scripta]]'' (&quot;Twelve Marks&quot;), involving [[dice]] and arranging pieces on a grid of letters or words.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Austin, &quot;Roman Board Games I,&quot; ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4.10 (1934) 24–34.&lt;/ref&gt; A game referred to as ''alea'' (dice) or ''tabula'' (the board), to which the emperor [[Claudius]] was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to [[backgammon]], using a dice-cup ''(pyrgus)''.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, &quot;Roman Board Games II,&quot; pp. 76–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Playing with [[dice]] as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the [[Saturnalia]] with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.

===Clothing===
{{Main|Clothing in ancient Rome}}
In a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille M. Lee, &quot;Clothing,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order.&lt;ref&gt;Lynda L. Coon, ''Sacred Fictions: Holy Women and Hagiography in Late Antiquity'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[toga]] was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga: Understanding the History of Roman Dress,&quot; ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 43.2 (1996), p. 216; [[Margarete Bieber]], &quot;Roman Men in Greek Himation ''(Romani Palliati)'' a Contribution to the History of Copying,&quot; ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 103.3 (1959), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular perception, the clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colorful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions [[braccae|trousers]].&lt;ref&gt;Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga,&quot; p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga,&quot;  pp. 204–220, especially pp. 206, 211; Bieber, &quot;Roman Men in Greek Himation,&quot; pp. 374–417; Guy P.R. Métraux, &quot;Prudery and ''Chic'' in Late Antique Clothing,&quot; in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Painting 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Women from the wall painting at the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], Pompeii]]
The basic garment for all Romans, regardless of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved [[tunic]]. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell to her feet, and a child's to its knees.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, &quot;Clothing,&quot; ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunics of poor people and laboring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined by the type of work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes ''(clavi)'' woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, &quot;Clothing,&quot; ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Other garments could be layered over the tunic.

The Imperial toga was a &quot;vast expanse&quot; of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga,&quot; p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In his work on oratory, [[Quintilian]] describes in detail how the public speaker ought to orchestrate his gestures in relation to his toga.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 11.3.137–149; Bieber, &quot;Roman Men in Greek Himation,&quot; p. 412; Coon, ''Sacred Fictions,'' pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In art, the toga is shown with the long end dipping between the feet, a deep curved fold in front, and a bulbous flap at the midsection.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber, &quot;Roman Men in Greek Himation,&quot; p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; The drapery became more intricate and structured over time, with the cloth forming a tight roll across the chest in later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Métraux, &quot;Prudery and ''Chic'' in Late Antique Clothing,&quot; pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''toga praetexta'', with a [[Tyrian purple|purple or purplish red]] stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|curule magistrates]], and state priests.&lt;ref&gt;Liza Cleland, ''Greek and Roman Dress from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga ''(toga picta)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, ''Greek and Roman Dress from A to Z,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, emperors and men of status are often portrayed wearing the [[pallium]], an originally Greek mantle ''([[himation]])'' folded tightly around the body. Women are also portrayed in the pallium. [[Tertullian]] considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, in contrast to the toga, and for educated people, since it was associated with philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De Pallio'' 5.2; Bieber, &quot;Roman Men in Greek Himation,&quot; pp. 399–411; Coon, ''Sacred Fictions,'' p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as a garment that embodied social unity.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga,&quot; p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman clothing styles changed over time, though not as rapidly as fashions today.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, &quot;Clothing,&quot; Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dominate]], clothing worn by both soldiers and government bureaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, ''clavi'', and circular roundels, ''orbiculi'', added to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements usually consisted of geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;Raffaele D'Amato, ''Roman Military Clothing (3) AD&amp;nbsp;400 to 640'' (Osprey, 2005), pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[silk]] also increased and most courtiers of the later empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of cultural life based on urban ideals, affected habits of dress: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and early medieval kings and nobles abandoned the toga and dressed in the manner of Roman generals.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'' (Penguin Books Ltd., 2009), p. 106. ISBN 978-0-670-02098-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literacy, books, and education==
{{Main|Education in Ancient Rome}}
Estimates of the average [[literacy rate]] in the Empire range from 5 to 30 percent or higher, depending in part on the definition of &quot;literacy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William V. Harris, ''Ancient Literacy'' (Harvard University Press, 1989), p. 5; William A. Johnson, ''Ancient Literacies: The Culture of Reading in Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 3–4, especially note 5; T.J. Kraus, &quot;(Il)literacy in Non-Literary Papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt: Further Aspects of the Educational Ideal in Ancient Literary Sources and Modern Times,&quot; ''Mnemosyme'' 53.3 (2000), p. 325; Marietta Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 89, 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman obsession with documents and public inscriptions indicates the high value placed on the written word.&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Mattern, ''Rome and the Enemy: Imperial Strategy in the Principate'' (University of California Press, 1999), p. 197; Teresa Morgan, ''Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2000), pp. 1–2 ''et passim''; Greg Woolf, &quot;Literacy or Literacies in Rome?&quot; in ''Ancient Literacies,'' p. 46ff.; Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 97. [[Clifford Ando]] poses the question as &quot;what good would 'posted edicts' do in a world of low literacy?' in ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2000), p. 101 (see also p. 87 on &quot;the government's obsessive documentation&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial bureaucracy was so dependent on writing that the [[Babylonian Talmud]] declared &quot;if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe ''([[scriba (ancient Rome)|scriba]])'' read or write their official documents for them.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', p. 101; Kraus, &quot;(Il)literacy in Non-Literary Papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt,&quot; pp. 325–327.&lt;/ref&gt; Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of ability to read.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', pp. 152, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Romans were not a &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot;, they had an extensive [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|priestly archive]], and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with statues and small [[votum|votives]] dedicated by ordinary people to divinities, as well as on [[defixio|binding tablets]] and other &quot;[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic spells]]&quot;, with hundreds of examples collected in the [[Greek Magical Papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], &quot;Ancient Literacy and the Written Word in Roman Religion,&quot; in ''Literacy in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 1991), p. 59ff; Matthew W.

For a case study of a specific region in the Western provinces, see Curchin, &quot;Literacy in the Roman Provinces&quot;, especially p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[numeracy]] was necessary for any form of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, ''Rome and the Enemy,'' p. 197; Morgan, ''Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds'', pp. 1–2 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers, and some were highly educated.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Morgan, &quot;Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister des Porträts des Paquius Proculus 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pride in literacy was displayed in portraiture through emblems of reading and writing, as in this example of a couple from Pompeii]]

Books were expensive, since each copy had to written out individually on a roll of papyrus ''(volumen)'' by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Wiliam A. Johnson, ''Readers and Reading Culture in the High Roman Empire: A Study of Elite Communities'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[codex]]—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty in the time of the poet [[Martial]] (1st century AD),&lt;ref&gt;Martial, ''Epigrams'' 1.2 and 14.184–92, as cited by Johnson, ''Readers and Reading Culture in the High Roman Empire,'' p. 17; Guglielmo Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex: Reading in the Roman World,&quot; in ''A History of Reading in the West'' (Polity Press, 1999, originally published in French 1995), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the ''volumen''&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Readers and Reading Culture in the High Roman Empire,'' p. 17; Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex: Reading in the Roman World,&quot; pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the regular form for books with Christian content.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex: Reading in the Roman World,&quot; p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; ''Phoenix'' 30.3 (1976), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1st century AD certain neighborhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops ''(tabernae librariae)'', which were found also in Western provincial cities such as [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France).&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex,&quot; p. 71; Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 253, citing on the book trade in the provinces Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'' 9.11.2; Martial, ''Epigrams'' 7.88; Horace, ''Carmina'' 2.20.13f. and ''Ars Poetica'' 345; Ovid, ''Tristia'' 4.9.21 and 4.10.128; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' 35.2.11; Sidonius, ''Epistulae'' 9.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies,&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.1.54, 50.13.419; Martial, ''Epigrams'' 2.8; [[Lucian]], ''Adversus Indoctum'' 1; Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[plagiarism]] or [[literary forgery|forgery]], since there was no [[copyright law]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; A skilled slave copyist ''(servus litteratus)'' could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Epistulae'' 27.6f.; Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectors amassed personal libraries,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; pp. 252–264.&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of the [[Herculaneum papyri|Villa of the Papyri]] in Herculaneum, and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure ''([[otium]])'' associated with the villa lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex,&quot; pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant collections might attract &quot;in-house&quot; scholars; [[Lucian]] mocked mercenary Greek intellectuals who attached themselves to [[wikt:philistine|philistine]] Roman patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; pp. 257, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual benefactor might endow a community with a library: [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] gave the city of [[Comum]] a library valued at 1 million sesterces, along with another 100,000 to maintain it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Epistulae'' 1.8.2; ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 5.5262 (= ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 2927); Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial libraries housed in state buildings were open to users as a privilege on a limited basis, and represented a [[literary canon]] from which disreputable writers could be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; pp. 261–262; Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex,&quot; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Books considered subversive might be publicly burned,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Agricola'' 2.1 and ''Annales'' 4.35 and 14.50; [[Pliny the Younger]], ''Epistulae'' 7.19.6; Suetonius, ''Augustus'' 31, ''Tiberius'' 61.3, and ''Caligula'' 16; Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domitian]] crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Domitian'' 10; Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 9.2.65; Marshall, &quot;Library Resources and Creative Writing at Rome,&quot; p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a writing tablet: the ''stylus'' was used to inscribe letters into the wax surface for drafts, casual letterwriting, and schoolwork, while texts meant to be permanent were copied onto papyrus]]
Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Habinek, &quot;Situating Literacy at Rome,&quot; p. 114ff., and Holt N. Parker, &quot;Books and Reading Latin Poetry,&quot; p. 186ff., both in ''Ancient Literacies;'' Garrett G. Fagan, &quot;Leisure,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Pliny the Elder]] engaged in &quot;[[Human multitasking|multitasking]]&quot; by having works read aloud to them while they dined, bathed or traveled, times during which they might also dictate drafts or notes to their secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Readers and Reading Culture in the High Roman Empire,'' p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The multivolume ''Attic Nights'' of [[Aulus Gellius]] is an extended exploration of how Romans constructed their literary culture.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Johnson, &quot;Constructing Elite Reading Communities in the High Empire,&quot; in ''Ancient Literacies'', p. 320ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The reading public expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, and while those who read for pleasure remained a minority, they were no longer confined to a sophisticated ruling elite, reflecting the social fluidity of the Empire as a whole and giving rise to &quot;consumer literature&quot; meant for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex,&quot; pp. 68–69, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated books, including erotica, were popular, but are poorly represented by extant fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex,&quot; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary education===
In Latin, ''illiteratus'' (Greek ''agrammatos'') could mean both &quot;unable to read and write&quot; and &quot;lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Ancient Literacy'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education promoted career advancement, particularly for an equestrian in Imperial service: &quot;eloquence and learning were considered marks of a well-bred man and worthy of reward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Saller, &quot;Promotion and Patronage in Equestrian Careers,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 70 (1980), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Horace, for instance, was given a top-notch education by his father, a prosperous former slave.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstron, &quot;The Biographical and Social Foundations of Horace's Poetic Voice,&quot; in ''A Companion to Horace'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 11; R.O.A.M. Lyne, ''Horace: Beyond the Public Poetry'' (Yale University Press, 1995), pp. 2–3; Marietta Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; But formal education was available only to those who could pay for it, and the lack of state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire: Outsiders Within'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011, originally published in Dutch 2006), p. 108; Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, were meant to instill Roman values ''([[mos maiorum|mores maiorum]])''. Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young children were attended by a ''[[Education in ancient Greece|pedagogus]],'' or less frequently a female ''pedagoga'', usually a Greek slave or former slave.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The pedagogue kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behavior, attended class and helped with tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 90, 92; Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] recalled his pedagogue Mardonius, a [[eunuch]] slave who reared him from the age of 7 to 15, with affection and gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, however, pedagogues received little respect.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' pp. 116–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic occurred at home for privileged children whose parents hired or bought a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others attended a school that was &quot;public,&quot; though not state-supported, organized by an individual schoolmaster ''([[ludi magister|ludimagister]])'' who accepted fees from multiple parents.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vernae'' (homeborn slave children) might share in home- or public-schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools became more numerous during the Empire, and increased the opportunities for children to acquire an education.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; School could be held regularly in a rented space, or in any available public niche, even outdoors. Classes were not segregated by grade or age, but boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire'', pp. 107–108, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; For the socially ambitious, bilingual education in Greek as well as Latin was a must.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quintilian]] provides the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ''ingenium,'' a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that is ready to be cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate.&lt;ref&gt;W. Martin Bloomer, ''The School of Rome: Latin Studies and the Origins of Liberal Education'' (University of California Press, 2011), pp. 93–97; Morgan, ''Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds,'' p. 250. Quintilian uses the metaphor ''acuere ingenium,'' &quot;to sharpen talent,&quot; as well as agricultural metaphors.&lt;/ref&gt; The child incapable of learning was rare.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer, ''The School of Rome,'' pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; To Quintilian, ''ingenium'' represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer, ''The School of Rome,'' pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He also recognized the importance of play in child development,&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer, ''The School of Rome,'' p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and disapproved of [[corporal punishment]] because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane ''(ferula)'' or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] (1st century AD) asserted that the education of children was a foremost concern of Jewish families. Reading was necessary to know the [[Torah]] and observe [[Halakha|the law]], but an advanced ability to write was a specialized scribal skill.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Against Apion'' 1.60; David M. Carr, ''Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 247; Chris Keith, ''The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 75–79; Catherine Hezser, ''Jewish Literacy in Roman Palestine'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2001) ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions of literacy for Jewish families and within the Roman Empire as a whole contribute to questions about whether [[Jesus of Nazareth]] would have been able to [[Historical Jesus#Literacy|read and write]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, &quot;The Jesus of History: Context, Family and Formation,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education was provided by ''[[wikt:grammaticus|grammatici]]'' or ''[[rhetor]]es''.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''grammaticus'' or &quot;grammarian&quot; taught mainly Greek and Latin literature, with history, geography, philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rhetor'' was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals ''([[paideia]])'',&lt;ref&gt;Paula Fredriksen, &quot;Christians in the Roman Empire in the First Three Centuries CE,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; though the curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Augustus, contemporary Latin authors such as Vergil and Livy also became part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;K. Sara Myers, &quot;Imperial Poetry,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire,'' pp. 439, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning as an expression of cultural achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; On this model, Vespasian [[endowed chair]]s of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair of grammar at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire,'' p. 110; Morgan, &quot;Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, upperclass males made their [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|rite of passage]] into adulthood, and began to learn leadership roles in political, religious, and military life through mentoring from a senior member of their family or a family friend.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; p. 88, and Joy Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; p. 106, both in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students who wished to pursue the highest levels of education went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. In the eastern empire, [[Berytus]] (present-day [[Beirut]]) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of speaking ''(ars dicendi)'' was highly prized as a marker of social and intellectual superiority, and ''eloquentia'' (&quot;speaking ability, eloquence&quot;) was considered the &quot;glue&quot; of a civilized society.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' pp. 102–103, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of references to the [[literary canon]]&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;) as it was a mode of expression and decorum that distinguished those who held social power.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' pp. 103, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient model of rhetorical training—&quot;restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humor&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;—endured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, &quot;Rhetorical Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World,'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educated women===
Literate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be [[calligrapher]]s and scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. Habinek, ''The Politics of Latin Literature: Writing, Identity, and Empire in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 122; Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;girlfriends&quot; addressed in Augustan love poetry, although fictional, represent an ideal that a desirable woman should be educated, well-versed in the arts, and independent to a frustrating degree.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon L. James, ''Learned Girls and Male Persuasion: Gender and Reading in Roman Love Elegy'' (University of California Press, 2003), pp. 21–25; W.R. Johnson, &quot;Propertius,&quot; pp. 42–43, and Sharon L. James, &quot;Elegy and New Comedy,&quot; p. 262, both in ''A Companion to Roman Love Elegy'' (Blackwell, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders during the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, &quot;Primary Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; A highly educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household, but one that Martial regards as an unnecessary luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek, ''The Politics of Latin Literature'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman who achieved the greatest prominence in the ancient world for her learning was [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], who educated young men in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy, and advised the Roman [[prefect of Egypt]] on politics. Her influence put her into conflict with the [[bishop of Alexandria]], [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], who may have been implicated in her violent death in 415 at the hands of a Christian mob.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of literacy===
Literacy began to decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political [[Crisis of the Third Century]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Ancient Literacy,'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Church Fathers]] were well-educated, they regarded Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after the conversion of Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, on the grounds that they might corrupt the minds of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, &quot;Education,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book roll had emphasized the continuity of the text, the codex format encouraged a &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach to reading by means of citation, fragmented interpretation, and the extraction of maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex: Reading in the Roman World,&quot; pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th and 6th centuries, reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, &quot;Between ''Volumen'' and Codex: Reading in the Roman World,&quot; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

People visiting or living in Rome or the cities throughout the Empire would have seen art in a range of [[Style (aesthetics)|styles]] and [[List of artistic media|media]] on a daily basis. [[Public art|Public or official art]]—including [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], monuments such as [[List of Roman victory columns|victory columns]] or [[triumphal arch]]es, and the iconography on [[Roman currency|coins]]—is often analyzed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Meredith Kousse, ''Hellenistic and Roman Ideal Sculpture: The Allure of the Classical'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 1; Lea Stirling, &quot;Art, Architecture, and Archaeology in the Roman Empire,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire,'' pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]], statues, and [[Interior architecture|interior decoration]] often of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, &quot;Art, Architecture, and Archaeology in the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the private sphere, objects made for [[votum|religious dedications]], [[Roman funerals and burial|funerary commemoration]], domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of aesthetic quality and artistic skill.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine K. Gazda, introduction to ''Roman Art in the Private Sphere: Architecture and Décor of the Domus, Villa, and Insula'' (University of Michigan Press, 1991, 1994), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and [[decorative arts]] at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers as strenuous rather than tasteful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zanker]], ''Pompeii: Public and Private Life,'' translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider (Harvard University Press, 1998, originally published 1995 in German), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.&lt;ref&gt;Kousse, ''Hellenistic and Roman Ideal Sculpture,'' pp. 4–5, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low social status among the Greeks and Romans, who regarded artists, artisans, and craftsmen alike as manual laborers. At the same time, the level of skill required to produce quality work was recognized, and even considered a divine gift.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Hackworth Petersen, &quot;Crafts and Artisans,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
{{Main|Theatre of ancient Rome|Music of ancient Rome}}

The Greek tradition of all-male literary theatre performed in [[:Commons:Category:Greek and Roman theater masks|masks]] continued into the Empire, represented in [[#Literature|Latin literature]] by the tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally [[staged reading]]s to full productions reflecting the Roman love of spectacle and engineering technology.&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular form of theatre, however, was the genre-defying ''mimus'', which featured scripted scenarios with [[improvisation|improv]], risqué language and jokes, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sex]] scenes, action sequences, and [[political satire]], along with dance numbers, [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and [[tightrope walking]], [[striptease]], and [[dancing bear|trained bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], &quot;Mime: The Missing Link in Roman Literary History,&quot; ''Classical World'' 82 (1989), p. 230; William J.

Potter, &quot;Entertainers in the Roman Empire,&quot; in ''Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mimus'' was played without masks, and promoted stylistic realism in acting. Female roles were performed by women, not by men [[travesti (theatre)|in drag]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gian Biagio Conte]], ''Latin Literature: A History''  (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, originally published 1987 in Italian), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mimus'' was related to the genre called ''pantomimus'', an early form of [[story ballet]] that contained no spoken dialogue. ''Pantomimus'' combined expressive dancing, instrumental music and a sung [[libretto]], often mythological, that could be either tragic or comic.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Franklin, Jr., &quot;Pantomimists at Pompeii: Actius Anicetus and His Troupe,&quot; ''American Journal of Philology'' 108.1 (1987), John H.

[[File:Choregos actors MAN Napoli Inv9986.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|All-male theatrical troupe preparing for a masked performance, on a mosaic from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]]]]
Although sometimes regarded as foreign elements in Roman culture, music and dance had existed in Rome from earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick G. Naerebout, &quot;Dance in the Roman Empire and Its Discontents,&quot; in ''Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007)'' (Brill, 2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Music was customary at funerals, and the ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]]''), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences.&lt;ref&gt;Maria E. Ginsberg-Klar, &quot;The Archaeology of Musical Instruments in Germany during the Roman Period,&quot; ''World Archaeology'' 12.3 (1981), pp. 313, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Song ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmen]])'' was a profound part of almost every social occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005) ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Carmen Saeculare|Secular Ode]]'' of [[Horace]], commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song,'' p. 90ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[woodwind]]s and [[brass instrument|&quot;brass&quot; instruments]] were played, as were [[stringed instruments]] such as the ''[[cithara]]'', and [[percussion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg-Klar, &quot;The Archaeology of Musical Instruments in Germany during the Roman Period,&quot; p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cornu (horn)|cornu]]'', a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, was used for military signals and on parade.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg-Klar, &quot;The Archaeology of Musical Instruments in Germany during the Roman Period,&quot; p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces. Instruments are widely depicted in Roman art.

The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'' was &quot;one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginsberg-Klar p. 316&quot;&gt;Ginsberg-Klar, &quot;The Archaeology of Musical Instruments in Germany during the Roman Period,&quot; p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre, as well as stage performances. It was among the instruments that the emperor Nero played.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginsberg-Klar p. 316&quot;/&gt;

Although certain forms of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome, such as those of the dancing armed [[Salii|Salian priests]] and of the [[Arval Brothers]], priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate.&lt;ref&gt;Naerebout, &quot;Dance in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international [[mystery religions]], particularly the cult of [[Cybele]] as practiced by her eunuch priests the [[Galli]]&lt;ref&gt;Naerebout, &quot;Dance in the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 154, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Isis]]. In the secular realm, dancing girls from [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Gades|Cadiz]] were extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Naerebout, &quot;Dance in the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Llike [[gladiator]]s, entertainers were ''[[infamia|infames]]'' in the eyes of the law, little better than slaves even if they were technically free. &quot;Stars&quot;, however, could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity, and mingled socially and often sexually with the upper classes, including emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, &quot;Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 539–540.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers supported each other by forming guilds, and several memorials for members of the theatre community survive.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Csapo and William J. Slater, ''The Context of Ancient Drama'' (University of Michigan Press, 1994), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre and dance were often condemned by [[Christian polemic]]ists in the later Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Naerebout, &quot;Dance in the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christians who integrated dance traditions and music into their worship practices were regarded by the [[Church Fathers]] as shockingly &quot;pagan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire: (A. D. 100-400)'' (Yale University Press, 1984), pp. 74–75, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Augustine]] is supposed to have said that bringing clowns, actors, and dancers into a house was like inviting in a gang of [[unclean spirit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by [[Alcuin]], ''Epistula'' 175 ''(Nescit homo, qui histriones et mimos et saltatores introduct in domum suam, quam magna eos immundorum sequitur turba spiritum)''; Yitzhak Hen, ''Culture and Religion in Merovingian Gaul, AD 481–751'' (Brill, 1995), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
{{See also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Early Christianity|Religious persecution in the Roman Empire}}
Religion in the Roman Empire encompassed the practices and beliefs the Romans regarded as their own, as well as the many [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cults]] imported to Rome or practiced by peoples throughout the provinces. The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining good relations with the gods ''([[pax deorum]])''. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot; or &quot;tradition&quot;, viewed as central to Roman identity.  There was no principle analogous to &quot;[[separation of church and state]]&quot;. The priesthoods of the state religion were filled by the same men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', &quot;I give that you might give.&quot; Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], &quot;Roman Religion – Religions of Rome,&quot; in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. [[Apuleius]] (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1; John Scheid, &quot;Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,&quot; in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.

In the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. [[Votum#Public vota|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called &quot;emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divus]]'') by vote of the Senate.  [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the &quot;Kaaba of Najran&quot;: جواد علي, المفصل في تاريخ العرب قبل الإسلام (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-‘Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; &quot;Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam&quot;), Baghdad, 1955–1983; P. Harland, &quot;Imperial Cults within Local Cultural Life: Associations in Roman Asia&quot;, originally published in ''Ancient History Bulletin / Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte'' 17 (2003) 91–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason against the emperor. This was the context for Rome's conflict with [[Early Christianity|Christianity]], which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]''.

[[File:HMB - Muri statuette group - Ensemble.jpg|thumb|left|Statuettes representing Roman and Gallic deities, for personal devotion at private shrines]]
The Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the representation of Roman religion in early Christian authors, see R.P.C. Hanson, &quot;The Christian Attitue to Pagan Religions up to the Time of Constantine the Great,&quot; and Carlos A. Contreras, &quot;Christian Views of Paganism,&quot; in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.23.1 (1980) 871–1022.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This mentality,&quot; notes John T.

Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, &quot;Roman Religion – Religions of Rome,&quot; p. 4; Benjamin H.

See, for instance, the altar dedicated by a Roman citizen and depicting a sacrifice conducted in the Roman manner for the Germanic goddess [[Vagdavercustis]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;/ref&gt; By the height of the Empire, numerous [[interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]], among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Epona]], and gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]].  Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[monotheism|monotheistic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], &quot;The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State,&quot; ''Classical Philology'' 81.4 (1986) 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mystery religions]], which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]&quot;, conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were [[interpretatio romana|reinterpreted]] within Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced, with its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France). The sanctuary established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol 1,1, 97–149.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The monotheistic rigor of [[Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that the Jewish religion, unlike that of the Christians, was considered a ''[[religio licita]]'', &quot;legitimate religion.&quot; [[Jewish–Roman wars|Wars between the Romans and the Jews]] occurred when conflict, political as well as religious, became intractable. When [[Caligula]] wanted to place a golden statue of his deified self in the [[Second Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], the potential sacrilege and likely war were prevented only by his timely death.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD led to the sacking of the temple and the [[Jewish diaspora|dispersal]] of Jewish political power.

Christianity emerged in [[Iudaea Province|Roman Judea]] as a [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish religious sect]] in the 1st century AD. The religion gradually spread out of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], initially establishing major bases in first [[Antioch]], then [[Alexandria]], and over time throughout the Empire as well as beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Clarke, &quot;Third-Century Christianity,&quot; in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 616; W.H.C.

The first persecution by an emperor occurred under Nero, and was confined to the city of Rome.

In the early 4th century, [[Constantine I]] became the first emperor to [[Christian conversion|convert to Christianity]], launching the era of Christian [[hegemony]]. The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and [[Hellenistic religion]] and to affirm the special status of Judaism, but in 391 under [[Theodosius I]] Christianity became the official [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of Rome]], to the exclusion of all others. From the 2nd century onward, the [[Church Fathers]] had begun to condemn the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire collectively as &quot;pagan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Brown, in Bowersock ''et al'', ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', Harvard University Press, (1999), for &quot;pagan&quot; as a mark of socio-religious inferiority in Latin Christian polemic: [http://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA625&amp;dq=pagus+paganus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES]&lt;/ref&gt; Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] (d. 402) were rejected, and Christian monotheism became a feature of Imperial domination.

[[File:Ovidiu03.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue in [[Constanţa]], Romania (the ancient colony Tomis), commemorating Ovid's exile]]
In the traditional [[literary canon]], [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|literature under Augustus]], along with that of the late Republic, has been viewed as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Latin literature, embodying the [[classicism|classical ideals]] of &quot;unity of the whole, the proportion of the parts, and the careful articulation of an apparently seamless composition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Roberts, ''The Jeweled Style: Poetry and Poetics in Late Antiquity'' (Cornell University Press, 1989, 2010), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The three most influential Classical Latin poets—[[Vergil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]—belong to this period. Vergil wrote the ''[[Aeneid]]'', creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|meters]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day [[Constanţa]], Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together [[Greco-Roman mythology]] from the [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|creation of the universe]] to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification of Julius Caesar]]. Ovid's versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became one of the primary sources of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was so influential in the [[medieval literature|Middle Ages]] that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the &quot;Age of Ovid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Aetas Ovidiana''; Charles McNelis, &quot;Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature,&quot; in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] and early history became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. [[Vitruvius]]'s book ''[[De Architectura]]'', the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.

Latin writers were immersed in the [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary tradition]], and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded [[satire]] as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]]. The [[satires of Juvenal|poetry of Juvenal]] offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.

The period from the mid-1st century through the mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of Latin literature. Under Nero, disillusioned writers reacted to Augustanism.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''The Jeweled Style,'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The three leading writers—[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, dramatist, and tutor of Nero; [[Lucan]], his nephew, who turned [[Caesar's civil war]] into [[Pharsalia|an epic poem]]; and the novelist [[Petronius]] ''([[Satyricon]])''—all committed suicide after incurring the emperor's displeasure. Seneca and Lucan were from Roman Spain, as was the later [[epigram]]matist and keen social observer [[Martial]], who expressed his pride in his [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard A. Curchin, &quot;Literacy in the Roman Provinces: Qualitative and Quantitative Data from Central Spain,&quot; ''American Journal of Philology'' 116.3 (1995), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; Martial and the epic poet [[Statius]], whose poetry collection ''[[Silvae]]'' had a far-reaching influence on [[Renaissance literature]],&lt;ref&gt;Harm-Jan van Dam, &quot;Wandering Woods Again: From Poliziano to Grotius,&quot; in ''The Poetry of Statius'' (Brill, 2008), p. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote during the reign of [[Domitian]].

The so-called &quot;Silver Age&quot; produced several distinguished writers, including the encyclopedist [[Pliny the Elder]]; his nephew, known as [[Pliny the Younger]]; and the historian [[Tacitus]]. The ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of the elder Pliny, who died during disaster relief efforts in the wake of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]], is a vast collection on flora and fauna, gems and minerals, climate, medicine, freaks of nature, works of art, and [[antiquarian]] lore. Tacitus's reputation as a literary artist matches or exceeds his value as a historian;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Master, &quot;The ''Histories'',&quot; in ''A Companion to Tacitus'' (Blackwell, 2012), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; his stylistic experimentation produced &quot;one of the most powerful of Latin prose styles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Sage, &quot;Tacitus' Historical Works: A Survey and Appraisal,&quot; ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.33.2 (1990), p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' by his contemporary [[Suetonius]] is one of the primary sources for imperial biography.

Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], and the senator [[Cassius Dio]]. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer and antiquarian [[Plutarch]], the geographer [[Strabo]], and the rhetorician and satirist [[Lucian]]. Popular [[Ancient Greek novel|Greek romance novels]] were part of the development of long-form fiction works, represented in Latin by the ''Satyricon'' of Petronius and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]].

From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian authors who would become the Latin [[Church Fathers]] were in active dialogue with the [[Classical tradition]], within which they had been educated. [[Tertullian]], a convert to Christianity from [[Africa province|Roman Africa]], was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the [[conversion of Constantine]], Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Michael von Albrecht, ''A History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius'' (Brill, 1997), vol. 2, p. 1294 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; When the orator [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] argued for the preservation of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome's religious traditions]], he was effectively opposed by [[Ambrose]], the future saint and [[bishop of Milan]]—a debate preserved by their missives.&lt;ref&gt;Von Albrecht, ''A History of Roman Literature,'' p. 1443.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lipsanoteca di Brescia.jpg|thumb|Lipsanoteca of [[Brescia]], an ivory chest with Biblical imagery (4th century)]]
In the late 4th century, [[Jerome]] produced the Latin translation of the [[Bible]] that became authoritative as the [[Vulgate]]. [[Augustine]], another of the Church Fathers from the province of Africa, has been called &quot;one of the most influential writers of western culture&quot;, and his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is sometimes considered the first [[autobiography]] of Western literature. In ''[[The City of God against the Pagans]],'' Augustine builds a vision of an eternal, spiritual Rome, a new ''[[#Geography|imperium sine fine]]'' that will outlast the collapsing Empire.

In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary aesthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality that has been compared to the mosaics characteristic of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''The Jeweled Style,'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the ''Saturnalia'' of [[Macrobius]] and ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' of [[Martianus Capella]]. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include [[Ausonius]], [[Prudentius]], [[Claudian]], and [[Sidonius]]. Ausonius (d. ca. 394), the [[Bordeaux|Bordelaise]] tutor of the emperor [[Gratian]], was at least nominally a Christian, though throughout his occasionally obscene mixed-genre poems, he retains a literary interest in the Greco-Roman gods and even [[druid]]ism. The imperial [[panegyric|panegyrist]] Claudian (d. 404) was a ''[[vir illustris]]'' who appears never to have [[conversion to Christianity|converted]].  Prudentius (d. ca. 413), born in a [[Hispania Tarraconensis|province of Roman Spain]] and a fervent Christian, was thoroughly versed in the poets of the Classical tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Von Albrecht, ''A History of Roman Literature,'' vol. 2, p. 1359ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and transforms their vision of poetry as a monument of immortality into an expression of the poet's quest for eternal life culminating in Christian salvation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Not since Vergil had there been a Roman poet so effective at establishing a master narrative for his people&quot;: Marc Mastrangelo, ''The Roman Self in Late Antiquity: Prudentius and the Poetics of the Soul'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sidonius (d. 486), a native of [[Lugdunum]], was a Roman senator and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Clermont|bishop of Clermont]] who cultivated a traditional villa lifestyle as he watched the Western empire succumb to barbarian incursions. His poetry and collected letters offer a unique view of life in late Roman Gaul from the perspective of a man who &quot;survived the end of his world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sidonius,&quot; in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'' (Harvard University Press, 1999, 200), p. 694; Roberts, ''The Jeweled Style,'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Roman economy}}
[[File:Romanreliefbank.jpg|thumb|Roman banker in a transaction]]
[[Moses Finley]] was the chief proponent of the primitivist view that the Roman economy was &quot;underdeveloped and underachieving,&quot; characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]]; urban centers that consumed more than they produced in terms of trade and industry; low-status artisans; slowly developing technology; and a &quot;lack of economic rationality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Current views are more complex. Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of [[land use]] that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities were known for particular industries or commercial activities, and the scale of building in urban areas indicates a significant construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Papyri preserve complex [[accounting]] methods that suggest elements of [[economic rationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Empire was highly monetized.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; pp. 285–286, p. 296f.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply contracts for the army, which pervaded every part of the Empire, drew on local suppliers near the base ''([[castrum]])'', throughout the province, and across provincial borders.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire is perhaps best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of &quot;political capitalism&quot; in which the state monitored and regulated commerce in order to assure its own revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; pp. 286, 295.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic growth]], though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, &quot;The Imperial Economy,&quot; p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face, not for its metal content. This tendency toward [[fiat money]] led eventually to the [[debasement]] of Roman coinage, with consequences in the later Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[William V. Harris|W.V.

Rome had no [[central bank]], and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity practiced [[fractional reserve banking]]. A typical bank had fairly limited [[Financial capital|capital]], and often only one principal, though a bank might have as many as six to fifteen principals.

A professional [[Deposit account|deposit]] banker (''argentarius,'' ''coactor argentarius'', or later ''nummularius'') received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Andreau, ''Banking and Business in the Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers, making loans from their personal fortunes on the basis of social connections.&lt;ref&gt;Andreau, ''Banking and Business in the Roman World'', p. 2; Harris, &quot;The Nature of Roman Money,&quot; n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The holder of a debt could use it a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked [[negotiable instrument|&quot;paper&quot; or documentary transactions]], the system of banks throughout the Empire also permitted the exchange of very large sums without the physical transfer of coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash, particularly by sea. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, a credit crisis in 33 AD that put a number of senators at risk; the central government rescued the market through a loan of 100 million ''HS''  made by the emperor Tiberius to the banks ''(mensae)''.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'' 6.17.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;The Nature of Roman Money,&quot; in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The central government itself did not borrow money, and without [[public debt]] had to fund [[Government budget balance|deficit]]s from cash reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duncan-Jones, ''Money and Government in the Roman Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperors of the [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, particularly the denarius, under the pressures of meeting military payrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', p. 125–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Sudden [[inflation]] during the reign of [[Commodus]] damaged the credit market.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;The Nature of Roman Money,&quot; in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-200s, the supply of [[specie (disambiguation)|specie]] contracted sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;The Nature of Roman Money,&quot; in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.; Hart, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or [[fiduciary currency]], general economic anxieties came to a head under [[Aurelian]], and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite [[Diocletian]]'s introduction of the gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;The Nature of Roman Money,&quot; in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining and metallurgy===

{{See also|Mining in Roman Britain}}
[[File:Panorámica de Las Médulas.jpg|thumb|Landscape resulting from the ''[[ruina montium]]'' mining technique at [[Las Médulas]], [[Roman Spain]], one of the most important gold mines in the Roman Empire]]
The main mining regions of the Empire were Spain (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the [[Danubian provinces]] (gold, iron); [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Thracia|Thrace]] (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin).  Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of [[open-cast mining]] and [[underground mining]]—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The gold mines of [[Dacia]], for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mining,&quot; in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'' p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydraulic mining]], which Pliny referred to as ''[[ruina montium]]'' (&quot;ruin of the mountains&quot;), allowed [[base metal|base]] and [[precious metal]]s to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Wilson, Andrew]] (2002): &quot;Machines, Power and the Ancient Economy&quot;, ''[[The Journal of Roman Studies]]'', Vol. 92, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–32 (17–21, 25, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500&amp;nbsp;[[tonnes]].&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, Paul T.

===Trade and commodities===
Roman trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China, as well as among the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;W.V. Harris, &quot;Trade,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 713.&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[commodity]] was grain.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;Trade,&quot; in ''CAH'' 11,  p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; Also traded were olive oil, wine, various foodstuffs, ''[[garum]]'' ([[fish sauce]]), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibers and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and ''[[materia medica]]'', ivory, pearls, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, &quot;Trade,&quot; in ''CAH'' 11, pp. 717–729.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor and occupations===
[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 1 - MAN.jpg|thumb|Workers at a cloth-processing shop, in a painting from the ''[[fullonica]]'' of Veranius Hypsaeus in Pompeii]]
Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in the city of Rome, and 85 different occupations in Pompeii.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, &quot;The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; [[Slavery in ancient Rome#Servus publicus|imperial or public service]]; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Slavery in Rome,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts provided much of the labor in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Slavery in Rome,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; But there was little division of labor between slave and free in practice. The greatest number of common laborers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming ''([[latifundia]])'', these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labor was probably less important than other forms of dependent labor by people who were technically not enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey and Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded among the peoples of the Empire, whose products were often named for them or a particular town, rather like a [[fashion design|fashion &quot;label&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A.H.M. Jones]], &quot;The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,&quot; ''Economic History Review'' 13.2 (1960), pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Better ready-to-wear was exported by businessmen (''negotiatores'' or ''mercatores'') who were often well-to-do residents of the production centers.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,&quot;p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, who traveled to potential customers, or by ''vestiarii,'' clothing dealers who were mostly freedmen; or they might be peddled by itinerant merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,&quot; p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, textile producers could run prosperous small businesses employing apprentices, free workers earning wages, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fulling|fullers]] (''[[fullonica|fullones]]'') and dye workers (''coloratores'') had their own guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,&quot; pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Centonarii'' were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into [[patchwork|pieced goods]].&lt;ref&gt;Vout, &quot;The Myth of the Toga,&quot; p. 212. The college of ''centonarii'' is an elusive topic in scholarship, since they are also widely attested as urban firefighters; see Jinyu Liu, ''Collegia Centonariorum: The Guilds of Textile Dealers in the Roman West'' (Brill, 2009). Liu sees them as &quot;primarily tradesmen and/or manufacturers engaged in the production and distribution of low- or medium-quality woolen textiles and clothing, including felt and its products.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political legacy==
{{See also|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}
Several states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successors after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]], an attempt to resurrect the Empire in the West, was established in 800 when [[Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;III]] crowned [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Charlemagne]] as [[Roman Emperor]] on [[Christmas Day]], though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalised for some decades. After the fall of [[Constantinople]], the [[Muscovy|Russian Tsardom]], as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition, counted itself the [[Third Rome]] (Constantinople having been the second). These concepts are known as [[Translatio imperii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Ancient Rome|author=Michael Burgan|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|page=113-114|isbn=0-8160-5559-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, [[Mehmed&amp;nbsp;II]] established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries, 1300-1815|author=Thomas F.

Neuschel, Elinor Ann Accampo|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|page=352|isbn=13-978-1-424-06959-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even went so far as to launch an invasion of Italy with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire and had invited European artists to Istanbul, including [[Gentile Bellini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe|author=Daniel Goffman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval West, &quot;Roman&quot; came to mean the church and the [[Pope]] of Rome. The Greek form [[Romaioi]] remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], and is still used by [[Greeks]] in addition to their common appellation.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, History of Europe, The Romans, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire's territorial legacy of controlling the Italian peninsula would serve as an influence to [[Italian nationalism]] and the unification (''[[Risorgimento]]'') of Italy in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Italian Unification, 1820-71|author=Martin Collier|publisher=Heinemann|year=2003|page=22|isbn=0-435-32754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
