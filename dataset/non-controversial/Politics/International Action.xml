'''International Action''' is a small, non-violent, political group in [[Hong Kong]] campaigning a range of issues including [[social justice]], [[human rights]] and [[democracy]]. The group was founded in 2004 and is made up of expatriate permanent residents and locals. Their website [http://www.thebiggerpicture.hk] claims that they &quot;represent the new breed of foreigners who are here [in Hong Kong] without the expatriate perks&quot;, however, they invite anyone to join them. The group is committed to [[non-violence]]. The group uses a mixed strategy of campaigning both in public and behind the scenes.

==Beliefs and approach==
The group's website states that it believes the democratic movement in Hong Kong needs to change it's strategy to be more effective in the fight for real power for the people. It says the democratic camp should consider using tactics that are right for the cultural, social and political situation of Hong Kong in 2008.

==Past action==
*On April 30, 2006, the group deflated a large [[McDonalds]] advertisement located on top of [[North Point]] Ferry Pier. The group was calling for better worker's rights and a minimum wage for [[Labour Day]], the following day. A member also described the inflatable bill-board as an 'eyesore' on the harbour.

*On January 23, 2006, the group supported teachers' unions demanding less pressure in Hong Kong schools. The group wore nooses around their necks to symbolise the increasing number of teacher stress-related suicides in the territory.

*On December 21, 2005, Matt Pearce, dressed as [[Santa Claus]], climbed onto a structure across Connaught Road, Central, while the [[Legislative Council]] voted on constitutional development. He was subsequently charged with causing a public nuisance and given 100 hours of community service.

*On December 4, 2005, group members, in costume, joined the democracy march to oppose the government's 5th report on Constitutional Development.

*On July 6, 2005, members dressed in tribal African clothing and unfurled a banner demanding more to be done at the [[G8]] meeting to tackle poverty in Africa.

*On July 1, 2005, the group dressed as cartoon characters '[[The Incredibles]]' and joined the territory-wide pro-democracy demonstration.

*On June 3, 2005, Matt Pearce climbed to the top of large outdoor TV screen in Central and unfurled a banner that said &quot;Tiananmen Square 4.6.1989 : Justice Must Prevail&quot;. For this protest, he was convicted of causing a [[public nuisance]] and given a 21 day prison sentence.

*On May 17, 2005, on the first [[International Day Against Homophobia]], the group dressed up to support the gay and lesbian community and demand that gay marriage is made legal.

*On May 1, 2005, [[Labour Day]] in Hong Kong, the group staged a protest dressed as Supermen in a branch of local supermarket '[[Park n Shop]]'. The group handed out $50 notes to staff, suggesting that the amount would be an appropriate [[minimum wage]] for Hong Kong workers.

*On April 1, 2005, [[April Fool's Day]], the group dressed as [[clowns]], suggesting that the upcoming election for [[Chief Executive]] was a joke and Hong Kong people wanted full [[democracy]].

*On March 14, 2005 on the eve of the 2005 Budget, a member dressed as [[Robin Hood]] and handcuffed himself to the front door of the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. The group wanted more to be done to help the poor in Hong Kong.
