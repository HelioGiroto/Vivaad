{{Party politics}}

A '''dominant-party system''', or '''one-party dominant system''', is a system where there is &quot;a category of parties/political organizations that have successively won election victories and whose future defeat cannot be envisaged or is unlikely for the foreseeable future.&quot;&lt;ref name=Suttner&gt;Suttner, R. (2006), &quot;Party dominance 'theory': Of what value?&quot;, ''Politikon'' 33 (3), pp. 277-297&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of parties have been cited as being dominant at one time or another, including the [[Kuomintang]] in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], and the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; Such dominance has not always been a matter of concern, with for example the dominance of the Indian National Congress being seen by some as source of stability supportive of the consolidation of democracy.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; 

Opponents of the &quot;dominant party&quot; system or theory argue that it views the meaning of [[democracy]] as given, and that it assumes that only a particular conception of [[representative democracy]] (in which different parties alternate frequently in power) is valid.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; One author argues that &quot;the dominant party 'system' is deeply flawed as a mode of analysis and lacks explanatory capacity. But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;

One of the dangers of dominant parties is &quot;the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.&quot;&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; In contrast to [[single-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a single-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as &quot;[[electoralism]]&quot; or &quot;soft authoritarianism&quot;, [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, or inherent cultural values averse to change. 

In some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press club), lawsuits against the opposition, rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: Supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., ANC in South Africa (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed Northern Ireland from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the Protestant majority.

Sub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example the District of Columbia has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation, Bavaria by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, Alberta by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] since 1971. In contrast some sub-national entities have comparatively more conservative or liberal forms of the parties in their entity, for example an Oklahoma Democrat is likely to be at least as conservative as a Minnesota Republican. 

During the 20th century, the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] in [[Italy]] governed for more over than 50 years; this party was considered a party-state.
