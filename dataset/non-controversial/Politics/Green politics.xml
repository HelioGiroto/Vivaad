{{Green politics sidebar |expanded=all}}
'''Green politics''' is a [[political ideology]] that aims for the creation of an ecologically sustainable society rooted in [[environmentalism]], [[social liberalism]], and [[grassroots democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  It began taking shape in the western world in the 1970s; since then Green parties have developed and established themselves in many countries across the globe, and have achieved some electoral success.

The political term ''Green'', a translation of the German ''Grün'', was coined by [[Alliance '90/The Greens|die Grünen]], a Green party formed in the late 1970s. The term ''[[political ecology]]'' is sometimes used in Europe and in academic circles, but in the latter has come to represent an interdisciplinary field of study.

Supporters of Green politics, called Greens, share many ideas with the [[ecology movement|ecology]], [[conservation movement|conservation]], [[environmental movement|environmentalism]], [[feminist movement|feminism]], and [[peace movement]]s. In addition to democracy and ecological issues, green politics is concerned with [[civil liberties]], [[social justice]], [[nonviolence]] and tends to support [[social progressivism]]. The party's platform is largely considered [[Left-wing politics|left]] in the political spectrum. However, as the 'Green' ideology expanded, there also came into separate existence green movements on the political right in the form of [[green conservatism]] and [[eco-capitalism]].

The Green ideology has connections with various other ecocentric political ideologies, including [[ecosocialism]], [[ecoanarchism]], [[ecofeminism]] and [[ecofascism]], but to what extent these can be seen as forms of Green politics is a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 47-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Influences===
Adherents to green politics tend to consider it to be part of a 'higher' worldview and not simply a political ideology. Green politics draws its ethical stance from a variety of sources, from the values of [[indigenous peoples]], to the ethics of [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]]. These people influenced green thought in their advocacy of long-term &quot;[[seven generation sustainability|seventh generation]]&quot; foresight, and on the personal responsibility of every individual to make moral choices.

Of course, unease about adverse consequences of human actions on nature predates the modern concept of “environmentalism&quot;. Social commentators as far apart as ancient Rome and China complained of air, water and noise pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Keys, David. &quot;How Rome polluted the world,&quot; ''Geographical'', December 2003. http://www.geographical.co.uk/Home/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical roots of environmentalism can be traced back to enlightenment thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] in France and, later, the author and naturalist [[Thoreau]] in America. Organised environmentalism began in late 19th Century Europe and the United States as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]] with its emphasis on unbridled economic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John. ''The Global Environmental Movement'' (London: John Wiley, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

“Green politics” first began as conservation movements, such as the [[Sierra Club]], founded in San Francisco in 1892.

Left-green platforms of the form that make up the green parties today draw terminology from the science of ecology, and policy from [[environmentalism]], [[deep ecology]], [[feminism]], [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[social democracy]], [[eco-socialism]], and [[social ecology]]. In the 1970s, as these movements grew in influence, green politics arose as a new philosophy which synthesized their goals.
In some far-right and fascist parties, nationalism has on occasion been tied into a sort of green politics which promotes environmentalism as a form of pride in the &quot;motherland&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Staudenmaier|title=Fascist Ecology: The 'Green Wing' of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents.|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html|accessdate=24 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080313141128/http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biehl, Janet. &quot;'Ecology' and the Modernization of Fascism in the German Ultra-right.&quot; http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/janet.html&lt;/ref&gt; according a minority of authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The green and the brown: a history of conservation in Nazi Germany|first=Frank |last=Uekötter

====Early development====

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F065187-0014, Bonn, Pressekonferenz der Grünen, Bundestagswahl.jpg|thumb|right|German Green Party founder, Petra Kelly, with former German cabinet member, Otto Schily, at press conference in 1983.]]

In June 1970 in the [[Netherlands]] a group called [[Kabouters]] won 5 of the 45 seats on the [[Amsterdam]] Gemeenteraad (City Council), as well as two seats each on councils in [[The Hague]] and [[Leeuwarden]] and one seat apiece in [[Arnhem]], [[Alkmaar]] and [[Leiden]]. The Kabouters were an outgrowth of [[Provo (movement)|Provo]]’s environmental White Plans and they proposed “Groenen Planen” (“Green Plans”).&lt;ref&gt;[http://madgorilla.org/kempton/provos.pdf The Provos. Amsterdam Anarchist revolt by Richard Kempton]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political party to be created with its basis in environmental issues was the [[United Tasmania Group]], founded in [[Australia]] in March 1972 to fight against deforestation and the creation of a dam that would damage [[Lake Pedder]]; whilst it only gained three percent in state elections, it had, according to Derek Wall, &quot;inspired the creation of Green parties all over the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1972, a meeting at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], New Zealand, launched the ''[[Values Party]]'', the world's first countrywide green party to contest Parliamentary seats nationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greens.org.nz/about/history.htm Greens in Time and Space: The History of The Green Party&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 1973, Europe's first green party, the UK's [[Ecology Party]], came into existence.

The German Green Party was not the first Green Party in Europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been, because they attracted the most media attention: The [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]], contended in their first national election in 1980. They started as a provisional coalition of civic groups and political campaigns which, together, felt their interests were not expressed by the conventional parties.  After contesting the 1979 Euro elections they held a conference which identified [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common Party platform: welding these groups together as a single Party. This statement of principles has since been utilised by many Green Parties around the world. It was this party that first coined the term &quot;Green&quot; (&quot;Grün&quot; in German) and adopted the [[sunflower]] symbol. In the [[German federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]], the Greens won 27 seats in the [[Bundestag]].

====Further developments====

The first Canadian foray into green politics took place in the Maritimes when 11 independent candidates (including one in Montreal and one in Toronto) ran in the 1980 federal election under the banner of the Small Party.  (Current Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May was the instigator and one of the candidates).  Inspired by Schumacher's Small is Beautiful, the Small Party candidates ran for the expressed purpose of putting forward an anti-nuclear platform in that election. It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the Green Party of Canada in 1983 (the Ontario Greens and British Columbia Greens were also formed that year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenparty.ca/en/about_us/our_history Brief note about the Small Party on Green Party of Canada website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, in 1995, the [[Green League]] became the first European Green Party to form part of a state-level Cabinet. The German Greens followed, forming a government with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (the &quot;[[Red-Green Alliance]]&quot;) from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on [[nuclear power]] in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the German government of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 Afghan War]]. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide, but demonstrated that they were capable of difficult political tradeoffs.

In Latvia, [[Indulis Emsis]], leader of the Green Party and part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]], an alliance of a Nordic agrarian party and the Green Party, was [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] for ten months in 2004, making him the first [[Green party|Green]] politician to lead a country in the history of the world. In the German state of Baden-Württenburg, the Green Party is the leader of the coalition with the Social Democrats since the [[Baden-Württemberg state election, 2011]].

==Core tenets==
According to [[Derek Wall]], a prominent British Green proponent, there are four pillars that define Green politics: [[ecology]], social justice, [[grassroots democracy]] and non-violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;/&gt;

In 1984, the [[Green Committees of Correspondence]] in the United States expanded the Four Pillars into Ten Key Values which, in addition to the Four Pillars mentioned above, include:
*[[Decentralization]]
*[[Community-based economics]]
*Post-patriarchal values (later translated to [[Feminism]])
*[[Respect for diversity]]
*Global responsibility
*Future focus

In 2001, the [[Global Greens]] were organized as an international Green movement. The [[Global Greens Charter]] identified six guiding principles:
*Ecological wisdom
*Social justice
*[[Participatory democracy]]
*Nonviolence
*[[Sustainability]]
*Respect for diversity

===Ecology===

===Economics===
{{Main|Green economics}}
Green economics focuses on the importance of the health of the [[biosphere]] to [[Quality of life|human well-being]]. Consequently, most Greens distrust conventional capitalism, as it tends to emphasize [[economic growth]] while ignoring ecological health; the &quot;[[full cost accounting|full cost]]&quot; of economic growth often includes damage to the biosphere, which is unacceptable according to green politics. Green economics considers such growth to be &quot;[[uneconomic growth]]&quot;— material increase that nonetheless lowers overall quality of life.

Some Greens refer to [[productivism]], [[consumerism]] and [[scientism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as &quot;grey&quot;, as contrasted with &quot;green&quot;, economic views. &quot;Grey&quot; implies age, concrete, and lifelessness.

Therefore, adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment. Greens want governments to stop [[subsidy|subsidizing]] companies that waste resources or pollute the natural world, subsidies that Greens refer to as &quot;[[dirty subsidy|dirty subsidies]]&quot;. Some currents of green politics place automobile and agribusiness subsidies in this category, as they may harm human health. On the contrary, Greens look to a [[green tax shift]] that will encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices.

Green economics is on the whole [[anti-globalization|anti-globalist]]. Economic [[globalization]] is considered a threat to well-being, which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy, termed the [[global economic monoculture]].

Since green economics emphasizes biospheric health, an issue outside the traditional left-right spectrum, different currents within green politics incorporate ideas from socialism and capitalism. Greens on the Left are often identified as [[Eco-socialism|Eco-socialists]], who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and [[Marxism]] and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation, social injustice, inequality and conflict.  [[Eco-capitalism|Eco-capitalists]], on the other hand, believe that the [[free market]] system, with some modification, is capable of addressing ecological problems. This belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book, ''The Gort Cloud'' that describes the [[gort cloud]] as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses.

===Participatory democracy===
Since the beginning, green politics has emphasized local, [[grassroots]]-level political activity and decision-making. According to its adherents, it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment. Therefore, green politics seeks to increase the role of [[deliberative democracy]], based on direct citizen involvement and [[consensus decision making]], wherever it is feasible.

Green politics also encourages political action on the individual level, such as [[ethical consumerism]], or buying things that are made according to environmentally ethical standards.  Indeed, many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over [[election|electoral politics]]. Historically, green parties have grown at the local level, gradually gaining influence and spreading to regional or provincial politics, only entering the national arena when there is a strong network of local support.

In addition, many Greens believe that governments should not levy taxes against strictly local production and trade. Some Greens advocate new ways of organizing authority to increase local control, including [[urban secession]] and [[bioregional democracy]].

Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Green politics on the whole is [[anti-nuclear|opposed to nuclear power]] and the buildup of [[persistent organic pollutants]], supporting adherence to the [[precautionary principle]], by which technologies are rejected unless they can be proven to not cause significant harm to the health of living things or the [[biosphere]]. In Germany and Sweden programs have been initiated to shut down all nuclear plants (known as [[nuclear power phase-out]]). But, on 5 February 2009, the Swedish Government announced an agreement allowing for the replacement of existing reactors, effectively ending the phase-out policy. And, on 6 September 2010, the German Federal Environment Norbert Röttgen and the Economy Ministers Rainer Brüderle announced an agreement for 12 more years operation of 17 nuclear plants.

In the spirit of nonviolence, Green politics opposes the [[War on Terrorism]] and the curtailment of [[civil rights]], focusing instead on nurturing [[deliberative democracy]] in war-torn regions and the construction of a [[civil society]] with an increased role for women.

Although Greens in the [[Green Party (United States)|United States]] &quot;call for an end to the '[[War on Drugs]]'&quot;  and &quot;for decriminalization of [[victimless crimes]]&quot;, they also call for developing &quot;a firm approach to law enforcement that directly addresses violent crime, including trafficking in hard drugs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/platform/2004/socjustice.html#1001998 U.S. Green Party platform:Criminal Justice] www.gp.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Green platforms generally favor tariffs on [[fossil fuels]], restricting [[genetically modified organisms]], and protections for [[ecoregions]] or [[communities]].  In keeping with their commitment to the preservation of diversity, greens are often committed to the maintenance and protection of indigenous communities, languages, and traditions. An example of this is the [[Irish Green Party]]'s commitment to the preservation of the [[Irish Language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenparty.ie/library/discussion_documents/gaeilge_staidph_ip_ar www.greenparty.ie webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Local movements===
Green ideology emphasizes [[participatory democracy]] and the principle of &quot;[[Think Globally, Act Locally|thinking globally, acting locally]]&quot;.  As such, the ideal Green Party is thought to grow from the bottom up, from neighborhood to municipal to (eco-)regional to national levels.  The goal is rule by a [[consensus decision-making|consensus decision making]] process.

Strong local coalitions are considered a pre-requisite to higher-level electoral breakthroughs. Historically, the growth of Green parties has been sparked by a single issue where Greens can appeal to ordinary citizens' concerns.  In Germany, for example, the Greens' early opposition to nuclear power won them their first successes in the federal elections.

===Global organization===
There is a growing level of global cooperation between Green parties.  Global gatherings of Green Parties now happen. The first Planetary Meeting of Greens was held 30–31 May 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, immediately preceding the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] held there.  More than 200 Greens from 28 nations attended. The first formal Global Greens Gathering took place in [[Canberra]], in 2001, with more than 800 Greens from 72 countries in attendance.  The second Global Green Congress was held in São Paulo, Brazil, in May 2008, when 75 parties were represented.

Global Green networking dates back to 1990. Following the Planetary Meeting of Greens in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a Global Green Steering Committee was created, consisting of two seats for each continent. In 1993 this Global Steering Committee met in Mexico City and authorized the creation of a [[Global Green Network]] including a [[Global Green Calendar]], [[Global Green Bulletin]], and [[Global Green Directory]]. The Directory was issued in several editions in the next years. In 1996, 69 Green Parties from around the world signed a common declaration opposing French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, the first statement of global greens on a current issue. A second statement was issued in December 1997, concerning the Kyoto climate change treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalgreens.info/ggn_ggnbriefhistory.html Global Greens – A Brief History of the Global Green Network&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2001 Canberra Global Gathering delegates for Green Parties from 72 countries decided upon a [[Global Greens Charter]] which proposes six key principles. Over time, each Green Party can discuss this and organize itself to approve it, some by using it in the local press, some by translating it for their web site, some by incorporating it into their manifesto, some by incorporating it into their constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://green.ca/english/members/constitution.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; This process is taking place gradually, with online dialogue enabling parties to say where they are up to with this process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br/virtual.html hpG – O mundo é de quem faz – O maior conteúdo da internet&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gatherings also agree on organizational matters. The first Gathering voted unanimously to set up the ''Global Green Network'' (GGN). The GGN is composed of three representatives from each Green Party. A companion organization was set up by the same resolution: ''Global Green Coordination'' (GGC). This is composed of three representatives from each Federation (Africa, Europe, The Americas, Asia/Pacific, see below).  Discussion of the planned organization took place in several Green Parties prior to the Canberra meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greens.org.au/bobbrown/global.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The GGC communicates chiefly by email.  Any agreement by it has to be by unanimity of its members. It may identify possible global campaigns to propose to Green Parties world wide. The GGC may endorse statements by individual Green Parties.  For example, it endorsed a statement by the US Green Party on the Israel-Palestine conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html 04.10.02: Global Greens on Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, Global Green Gatherings are an opportunity for informal networking, from which joint campaigning may arise. For example, a campaign to protect the [[New Caledonia]]n coral reef, by getting it nominated for World Heritage Status: a joint campaign by the New Caledonia Green Party, New Caldonian indigenous leaders, the [[French Green Party]], and the [[Australian Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global.greens.org.au/spinifex-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns [[Ingrid Betancourt]], the leader of the Green Party in [[Colombia]], the Green Oxygen Party (''[[Partido Verde Oxigeno]]''). Ingrid Betancourt and the party's Campaign Manager, Claire Rojas, were kidnapped by a hard-line faction of [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] on 7 March 2002, while travelling in FARC-controlled territory. Betancourt had spoken at the Canberra Gathering, making many friends. As a result, Green Parties all over the world have organized, pressing their governments to bring pressure to bear. For example, Green Parties in African countries, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, France, Scotland, Sweden and other countries have launched campaigns calling for Betancourt's release. [[Bob Brown]], the leader of the [[Australian Greens]], went to Colombia, as did an envoy from the European Federation, [[Alain Lipietz]], who issued a report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz Devuelve a Ingrid Viva&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The four Federations of Green Parties issued a message to FARC.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}[http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep]&lt;/ref&gt; Ingrid Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian military in [[Operation Jaque]] in 2008. However, the efforts of the Green Parties shows their potential to unite and campaign jointly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm Devuelve a Ingrid Viva&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Green meetings====
Separately from the Global Green Gatherings, ''Global Green Meetings'' take place. For instance, one took place on the fringe of the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesberg.  Green Parties attended from Australia, Taiwan, Korea, South Africa, Mauritius, Uganda, Cameroon, Republic of Cyprus, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the USA, Mexico and Chile.

The Global Green Meeting discussed the situation of Green Parties on the African continent; heard a report from [[Mike Feinstein]], former Mayor of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], about setting up a web site of the GGN; discussed procedures for the better working of the GGC; and decided two topics on which the Global Greens could issue statements in the near future: Iraq and the 2003 WTO meeting in Cancun.

===Green federations===
The member parties of the [[Global Greens]] are organised into four continental federations:
*[[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]]
*[[Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas|Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas / Federación de los Partidos Verdes de las Américas]]
*[[Asia-Pacific Green Network]]
*[[European Federation of Green Parties]]

The European Federation of Green Parties formed itself as the [[European Green Party]] on 22 February 2004, in the run-up to [[European Parliament]] elections in June 2004, a further step in trans-national integration.

==Currents==
Green politics is usually said to include the [[green anarchism]], [[eco-anarchism]], [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and [[peace movement]]s – although these often claim not to be aligned with any party. Some claim it also includes feminism, [[pacifism]] and the [[animal rights]] movements. Some Greens support policy measures to empower women, especially mothers; to oppose war and de-escalate conflicts and stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict, and [[Great Ape personhood]].

Greens on the Left adhere to eco-socialism, an ideology that combines ecology, environmentalism, socialism and [[Marxism]] to criticise the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises, social exclusion, inequality and conflict. Green Parties are not eco-socialist but some Green Parties around the world have or have had a significant Eco-socialist membership. This has led some on the right to refer to Greens disparagingly as &quot;watermelons&quot;{{spaced ndash}}green on the outside, [[Red (political adjective)#Use by political movements|red]] on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/watermelon &quot;watermelon&quot; definition from Double-Tongued Dictionary&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this stereotype, some centrist Greens follow more [[geo-libertarian]] views which emphasize [[natural capitalism]]{{spaced ndash}}and shifting taxes away from value created by labor or service and charging instead for human consumption of the wealth created by the natural world. Greens may view the processes by which living beings compete for mates, homes, and food, ecology, and the cognitive and political sciences very differently. These differences tend to drive debate on ethics, formation of policy, and the public resolution of these differences in leadership races. There is no single ''Green Ethic''.
