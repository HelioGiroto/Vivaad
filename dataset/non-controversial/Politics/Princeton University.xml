'''Princeton University ''' is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education#Doctorate-granting Universities|research university]] located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, United States.

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural science]]s and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/|title=About Princeton|author=Princeton University, Office of Communications|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton does not have schools of medicine, law, [[divinity]], or business, but it does offer professional degrees through the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], the [[Princeton University School of Engineering and Applied Science]] and the School of Architecture. 

Founded in 1746 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], New Jersey, as the College of New Jersey, the university moved to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in 1747, then to Princeton in 1756 and was renamed Princeton University in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/ph/05/03.htm|title=&quot;Princeton's History&quot; — Parent's Handbook, 2005–06|publisher=Princeton University|month=August | year=2005|accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060904214124/http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/ph/05/03.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present-day [[The College of New Jersey|College of New Jersey]] in nearby [[Ewing Township, New Jersey|Ewing Township]], New Jersey, is an unrelated institution. Princeton was the [[Colonial Colleges|fourth]] chartered institution of higher education in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton's own phrasing is that it was &quot;the fourth college to be established in British North America.&quot;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/facts/revolution.html|title=Princeton in the American Revolution|author=Princeton University, Office of Communications|accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=founding&gt;Princeton is the fourth institution of higher learning to obtain a collegiate charter, conduct classes or grant degrees, based upon dates that do not seem to be in dispute. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date; the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899, its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date. For the details of Penn's revised claim for its founding date, see [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html &quot;Building Penn's Brand&quot;] for background or [http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/older.shtml &quot;Princeton vs. Penn: Which is the Older Institution?&quot;] for Princeton's view. To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a [[Log College]] was operated by [[William Tennent|William]] and [[Gilbert Tennent]], the Presbyterian ministers, in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], from 1726 until 1746; it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. Princeton, however, has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts &quot;do not warrant&quot; such an interpretation.[http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html] [[Columbia University]] was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754. Columbia considers itself to be the fifth institution of higher learning in the United States, based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton had close ties to the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], but has never been affiliated with any denomination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/facts/revolution.html|title=Princeton in the American Revolution|author=Princeton University Office of Communications|accessdate=May 24, 2011}} The original [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]] &quot;were acting in behalf of the evangelical or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church, but the College had no legal or constitutional identification with that denomination. Its doors were to be open to all students, 'any different sentiments in religion notwithstanding.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and today imposes no religious requirements on its students.&lt;ref&gt;Compulsory chapel attendance was reduced from twice a day in 1882 and abolished in 1964: [http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/university_chapel.html?15#mfs princeton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The university has ties with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and the [[Westminster Choir College]] of [[Rider University]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton Theological Seminary and Westminster Choir College maintain [[cross-registration]] programs with the university.&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton has been associated with 35 [[Nobel Laureates]], 17 [[National Medal of Science]] winners, and three National Humanities Medal winners. On a per-student basis, Princeton has the largest university endowment in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|title=Colleges with the Biggest Endowments Per Student|author=CNBC|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Princeton University}}
[[Image:Rhind sculpture at Princeton.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sculpture by [[J. Massey Rhind]] (1892), Alexander Hall, Princeton University]]
[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the '''College of New Jersey''', later Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;{{cite web|title=Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url=http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description|work=Princeton University Library Finding Aids|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was the educational and religious capital of Scots-Irish America. In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau|house]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became President in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffry H. Morrison, ''John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nassau Hall|work=Princeton University The First 250 Year|publisher=Steering Committee for Princeton's 250th Anniversary|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months. Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires, (1802 and 1855) Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin lion sculptures that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall/&gt; Nassau Hall's iconic bell rang after the halls construction however the fire of 1802 melted the bell. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]]. During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[Gothic revival|High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html |title=Princeton Companion |publisher=Etc.princeton.edu |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCosh Hall is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall/&gt;

In 1879, the first thesis for PhD was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides. During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university. 

In 1900, the Graduate school was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Princeton Chronology|work=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|publisher=Steering Committee for Princeton University's 250th Anniversary|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]] graduate of the Class of 1879 is elected the 13th president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University: The First 250 Years&lt;/ref&gt;
Under [[Woodrow Wilson]], Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

In 1906, [[Lake Carnegie]] was created by [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; A collection of Historical photographs of the building of the lake is housed at the [[Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library]] on Princeton's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.princeton.edu/getEad?eadid=AC065&amp;kw=ac065 |title=Historical Photograph Collection, Lake Carnegie Construction Photographs, circa 1905–1907: Finding Aid |publisher=Findingaids.princeton.edu |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Thomas Mann with Albert Einstein, Princeton 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]] with [[Thomas Mann]] in Princeton, 1938]]
On October 2, 1913, the [[Princeton University Graduate College]] is dedicated.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;   

In 1914, the [[Palmer Stadium]] construction is completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

In 1919 the School of Architecture was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

In 1933, [[Albert Einstein]] becomes a lifetime member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with an office on the Princeton campus. 

===Coeducation at Princeton University===
{{main|Coeducation at Princeton University}}
In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university had actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. (Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meserve, as a PhD candidate in Turkish history in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study &quot;critical languages&quot; in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.)

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by [[Sally Frank]], [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', January 23, 1991, p. A4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The main campus sits on about {{convert|500|acre|km2}} split between two municipalities, the [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Borough of Princeton]] and [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]]. The James Forrestal Campus is split between nearby [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro]] and [[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]]. The University also owns some property in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey|West Windsor Township]].&lt;ref name=app-local-contributions&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/profile/local/ |title=A Princeton Profile: Local Contributions |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and [[Philadelphia]].

The first building on campus was [[Nassau Hall]], completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of campus facing Nassau Street.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/nassau_hall.html |title=A Princeton Companion: Nassau Hall |author=Alexander Leitch |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1979 |accessdate=Jun 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/chap2.html |title=Princeton University: An Interactive Campus History.

A group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by  [[Alexander Calder]] (''Five Disks: One Empty''), [[Jacob Epstein]] (''Albert Einstein''), [[Henry Moore]] (''Oval With Points''), [[Isamu Noguchi]] (''White Sun''), and [[Pablo Picasso]] (''Head of a Woman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/putnam_collection_sculpture.html |author=Alexander Leitch |title=A Princeton Companion: Putnam Collection of Sculpture |accessdate=Jun 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Serra]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog and the Fox (sculpture)|The Hedgehog and The Fox]]'' is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Megan|title=Princeton sculpture enriches beauty and character of campus|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/81/71I92/index.xml?section=featured|work=Princeton University website|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the southern edge of the campus is [[Lake Carnegie (New Jersey)|Lake Carnegie]], a man-made lake named for [[Andrew Carnegie]].

===Cannon Green===
Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the &quot;Big Cannon,&quot; which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was brought to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |pages=317–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second &quot;Little Cannon&quot; is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the War and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

In years when the Princeton football team beats the teams of both [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]] in the same season, Princeton celebrates with a bonfire on Cannon Green. This occurred most recently in 2006, ending a twelve-year drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/11/20/16662/ |title='Not for ourselves, but for the entire Princeton community' |author=Sam Fox Krauss |date=Nov 20, 2006 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
====Nassau Hall====
{{main|Nassau Hall}}
[[Image:nassau hall princeton university.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Nassau Hall from the front.]]
Nassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756,&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt; it was the first seat of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] in 1776,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2003/07/14/8389/ |title=Nassau Hall: National history, center of campus |date=Jul 14, 2003 |author=Ryan Bradner |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |accessdate=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was involved in the battle of Princeton in 1777,&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt; and was the seat of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783 to November 4, 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/buildings/section8 |title=Buildings of the Department of State: Nassau Hall, Princeton, N.J. |author=U.S. State Department |accessdate=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices, and remains the symbolic center of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/web_exclusives/more/more_18b.html |author=Sean Wilentz |title=Nassau Hall, Princeton, New Jersey |date=May 16, 2001 |accessdate=Jun 3, 2011 |magazine=Princeton Alumni Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front entrance is flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt; Commencement is held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall in good weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/commencement/ |title=Commencement Information – Overview |author=Office of the Vice President &amp; Secretary, Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/nj/Mercer/state2.html |title=NEW JERSEY – Mercer County |author=National Register of Historic Places |accessdate=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residential colleges====
Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the &quot;New New Quad&quot;) before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html |title=Andrew Fleming West |publisher=Etc.princeton.edu |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls. Butler and most of Forbes are in a different municipality, Princeton Township, from the rest of the main campus, which is in [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]].

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Oxford University and Cambridge University. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the G.C. was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;  The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

====McCarter Theatre====
{{main|McCarter Theatre}}

Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue and spring musicals in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the United States.

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}
The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 72,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of Pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

====University Chapel====
{{main|Princeton University Chapel}}
[[Image:Princeton University Chapel 2003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Princeton University Chapel]]
The [[Princeton University Chapel]] is located on the north side of campus, near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928, at a cost of US$2.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_univchapel.html |first=Sara |last=Bush |title=The University Chapel |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately US${{inflation|US|2.3|1928|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars. Ralph Adams Cram, the University's supervising architect, designed the Chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.&lt;ref name=milliner-pip /&gt; At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881074,00.html |title=Religion: Princeton's chapel |magazine=TIME |date=Jun 11, 1928 |accessdate=Jun 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It underwent a two-year, US$10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.princeton.edu/paw/archive_new/PAW01-02/11-0313/features1.html |first=Kathryn Federici |last=Greenwood |title=Features: Chapel gets facelift and a new dean |magazine=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=Mar 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of US$17.1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university has the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over US$2 [[million]] for undergraduates).&lt;ref name=&quot;CNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student | year=2011 | work=CNBC | url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion | year=2006 | work=The Daily Princetonian | url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/10/27/news/16400.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Princeton's wealth is invested in its art museum, which features works by [[Claude Monet]],  [[Vincent van Gogh]],  [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Andy Warhol]] among other prominent artists.

==Academics==
[[Image:PrincetonCourtyard.jpg|thumb|200px|The courtyard of East Pyne]]
Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. Doctoral education is available in all disciplines.&lt;ref name=&quot;degree programs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/ |title=Academic Departments &amp; Programs |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a &quot;precept.&quot; To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as &quot;junior papers.&quot; Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Princeton University Honor Committee |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/ |title=Honor Code |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68 |title=Honor Code |publisher=YouTube |date=September 12, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/ |title=Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline |publisher=Princeton University Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/08/sources/ |title=Acknowledging Your Sources |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Admissions and financial aid====
Princeton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 7.86% of undergraduate applicants in the 2011–12 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S33/30/35K46/index.xml?section=topstories |title=Princeton offers admission to 7.86 percent of applicants |author= Martin Mbugua |publisher=Princeton University |date=Mar 29, 2012 |accessdate=Jun 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool. In this way, the [[early decision]] program was effectively ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/86/07G08/ |title=Princeton to end early admission |author=Princeton University |date=Sep 18, 2006 |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, following decisions by the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University]] to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute an [[early action]] program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S29/85/15K32/index.xml |title=Princeton to reinstate early admission program |author=Princeton University |date=Feb 24, 2011 |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Business Journal rated Princeton as the most selective college in the Eastern United States in terms of admission selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/12/princeton-is-most-selective-college-in.html |title=Princeton is the most selective college in the Eastern US |author= G. Scott Thomas |date=December 12, 2011 |accessdate=Dec 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate [[Student loan|loans]] for all students who qualify for [[Student financial aid|financial aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/CollegeAndFamily/CutCollegeCosts/TheBestValuesInPrivateColleges.aspx |author=Jane Bennett Clark |date=Nov 9, 2010 |publisher=MSN Money |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All demonstrated need is met with combinations of grants and campus jobs. In addition, all admissions are [[Need-blind admission|need-blind]].&lt;ref name=princeton-in-brief&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/admissions/u/brief/faq/ |title=Princeton in Brief |author=Princeton University Office of Undergraduate Admissions}} |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' and [[Princeton Review]] both cite Princeton as the university that has the fewest of graduates with debt even though 60% of incoming students are on some type of [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/lst_natudoc_brief.php|title=America's Best Colleges 2008: Least Debt: National Universities|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report, L.P.|year=2008|accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kiplinger]]'' magazine ranks Princeton as the best value among private universities, noting that the average graduating debt is US$4,957, &quot;about one fifth the average debt of students who borrow at all private schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.kiplinger.com/tools/slideshows/slideshow_pop.html?nm=CollegesLowDebt&amp;page=2 |title=1.

====Grade deflation policy====
In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|publisher=Daily Princetonian|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it.

The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton offers postgraduate research degrees in many fields in the social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. Although Princeton offers professional graduate degrees in engineering, architecture, and finance, it has no [[medical school]], [[law school]], or [[business school]] like other research universities.&lt;ref&gt;A short-lived [[Princeton Law School]] folded in 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; The university's most famous professional school is the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and US President) [[Woodrow Wilson]].

Its collections include the [[Blickling homilies]]. In addition to Firestone library, many individual disciplines have their own libraries, including architecture, art history, East Asian studies, engineering, geology, international affairs and public policy, Near Eastern studies, and psychology. Seniors in some departments can register for enclosed carrels in the main library for workspace and the private storage of books and research materials. In February 2007, Princeton became the 12th major library system to join Google's ambitious project to scan the world's great literary works and make them searchable over the Web.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/6/90039.shtml Princeton University Joins Google Literature-Scan Project]&quot;.

==Student life and culture==
[[Image:Walker-1903-cuyler.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cuyler, Class of 1903, and Walker Halls are Princeton dormitories with Collegiate Gothic architecture.]]University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/| title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall for high school students and PICSim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picsim.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The 4-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools|title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities|accessdate=October 30, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions &quot;the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity,&quot; but goes on to say that &quot;still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus.&quot;

==Athletics==
Princeton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides &quot;a variety of physical education and recreational programs&quot; for members of the Princeton community. According to the athletics program's mission statement, Princeton aims for its students who participate in athletics to be &quot;'student athletes' in the fullest sense of the phrase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |title=Princeton University Mission Statement |accessdate =Jun 1, 2011 |author=Princeton Athletic Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/athletics/ |title=Athletics &amp; Fitness |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011 |author=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as ''Tigers'', and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/09/11/18534/ |title=Mascot revamped but still 'The Tiger' |author=Esther Breger |date=Sep 11, 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts about 35 club sports teams.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; [[Princeton Rugby|Princeton's rugby team]] is organized as a club sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Princeton's oldest clubs flourishes |author=Ben Laguna |date=Apr 3, 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/03/20695/ |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, nearly 300 teams participate in intramural sports at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |title=The Student Guide to Princeton: Intramurals |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 1 2–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intramurals are open to members of Princeton's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential college or eating club must consist only of members of that college or club. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |title=General Information |publisher=Princeton University Campus Recreation |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games is [[Princeton Cannon Song]], the Princeton University [[fight song]].

Bob Dylan wrote &quot;Day of The Locusts&quot; about his experience of receiving an honorary doctorate from the University. It is a reference to the negative experience he had and it mentions the cicada infestation of Princeton.

=== &quot;Old Nassau&quot; ===

&quot;[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]&quot; has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed &quot;[[Old Nassau reaction]]&quot; because the solution turns orange and then black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 |title=The Old Nassau reaction – Journal of Chemical Education (ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education) |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
