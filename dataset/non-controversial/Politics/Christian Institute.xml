'''The Christian Institute''' (CI) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] pressure group.  The CI promotes a [[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative Christian]] viewpoint, founded on belief in [[Biblical inerrancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/whoweare/basisoffaith.htm  Christian Institute Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=charity-1004774&gt;{{EW charity|1004774|The Christian Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CI is a registered charity.&lt;ref name=charity-1004774 /&gt;

While the CI has campaigned on issues including [[gambling]], [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]], it is most notable for its campaigns against [[gay rights]].  The CI sought to retain [[Section 28]] and a higher [[age of consent]] for [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], and opposed the [[Civil Partnership Act]] and legislation giving gay couples the right to [[adopt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/html-publications/counterfeitmarriage.htm Counterfeit Marriage] on Christian Institure website; retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt; It has opposed measures to prevent gay people being discriminated against in the provision of services and goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/news/govt-pushes-on-with-costly-equality-bill/ Govt pushes on with ‘costly’ Equality Bill] on Christian Institure website; retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] and the [[Equality Act 2010]] were ultimately enacted by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].  

The Christian Institute's activities resulted in [[censure]] by The [[Charity Commission]] in 2001, for breaching rules limiting overt political campaigning by charities, by &quot;publishing a 100-page report, ''Homosexuality and Young People'' (1998), which argued against reforming anti-homosexual law with no reference at all to a Christian view.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_reprimand&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1338340/Campaigning-charity-told-to-steer-clear-of-politics.html Campaigning charity told to steer clear of politics]. [[The Daily Telegraph]],  23 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the CI funded a full-page newspaper advertisement in [[The Times]] in support of a controversial [[Bill (proposed law)|amendment]] to the [[Civil Partnership Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/press-releases/public-strongly-supports-including-siblings-in-civil-partnership-bill/ Public strongly supports including siblings in Civil Partnership Bill] on Christian Institute website; retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment attempted to include within the scope of the Bill [[sibling]]s who had lived together for longer than 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/debtext/41109-12.htm  UK Parliament Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was ultimately rejected in both Houses of Parliament. In response to the advertisement, [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] questioned the CI's overt political campaigning in light of its charitable status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/debtext/41109-18.htm House of Commons Hansard Debates for 9 Nov 2004 (pt 18)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions==
In 2000, the CI became the only group to initiate a court case for an alleged breach of the now defunct [[Section 28#Political response|Section 28]]. The case failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/746575.stm Council halts gay group cash] website BBC News; retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/press-releases/glasgow-forced-not-to-promote-homosexuality/ Glasgow forced not to promote homosexuality] Christian Institute website; retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18747368.html Gay groups 'delighted' as Section 28 case dropped] [[The Scotsman]] July 7, 2000 on website Highbeam Research; retrieved on 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the CI and others unsuccessfully sought a judicial review of the [[Sexual orientation regulations|Sexual Orientation Regulations]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2007/2007%20NIQB%2066/j_j_WEAC5888Final.htm  judgment High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland - Queen’S Bench Division (2007) NIQB 66, ref. WEAC5888] retrieved 2012-08-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the CI funded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1020809/Christian-registrar-threatened-sack-refusing-conduct-gay-marriages.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Paul | last=Sims | title=Christian registrar 'threatened with sack' after refusing to conduct gay marriages | date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legal costs of Lillian Ladele, a [[Registrar General|registrar]] from [[Islington]], [[London]], who took her employer, [[Islington London Borough Council]], to the London Central [[Employment Tribunal]].  Ladele had refused to process the paperwork associated with [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] on religious grounds, and following complaints from other staff she was disciplined under the Council's ''Fairness for All'' policy.  Ladele claimed she had been subject to direct and indirect discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, on grounds of her religion. In July 2008, the tribunal found in Ladele's favour, however this ruling was overturned by the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] in December, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ladele&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/20/gayrights-law Landmark rulings strengthen gay rights in workplace]. [[The Guardian]], December 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The CI later launched an unsuccessful appeal against this ruling in the High Court, and has been refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secularism.org.uk/islington-christian-registrar-lo.html Islington “Christian registrar” loses High Court appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secularism.org.uk/islington-registrar-refused-perm.html Islington Registrar refused permission to appeal to Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the CI funded the defence of two Christian hotel owners accused of acting unlawfully under the [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations]], by refusing to let a gay couple in a [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]] stay in a double room reserved for married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5h-hNHGRnYPOYWvf-lm65nu8q7uig?docId=N0215851295345448354A |title=Gay couple hail hotel snub ruling |publisher=Press Association |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners lost both the case and the subsequent appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/10/christian-lose-appeal-gay-guests |title=Christian B&amp;B owners lose appeal over turning away gay guests |publisher=Guardian |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
