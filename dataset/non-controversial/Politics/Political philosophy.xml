'''Political philosophy''' is the study of such topics as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of a [[legal code]] by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever. In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term &quot;political philosophy&quot; often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hampton |first=Jean  |title=Political philosophy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-sHkdq5qhFwC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Hampton+political+philosophy+political+societies#v=onepage&amp;q=Hampton%20political%20philosophy%20political%20societies&amp;f=false |page=xiii |year=1997 |isbn=0-8133-0858-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} }} [[Charles Blattberg]], who defines politics as &quot;responding to conflict with dialogue,&quot; suggests that political philosophies offer philosophical accounts of that dialogue. See his {{cite journal | title= Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies| ssrn=1755117}} in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political philosophy can also be understood by analysing it through the perspectives of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]] and [[axiology]]. It  provides insight into, among other things, the various aspects of the origin of the state, its institutions and laws.

==History==
{{Further|History of political thought}}

===Ancient===

====Ancient China====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and the [[Warring States Period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[draconian]] punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot | coauthors  = Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hsü |first=Leonard Shihlien |title=The political philosophy of Confucianism |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FWFtQIyun-8C&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=political+philosophy+China#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20China&amp;f=false |pages=xvii-xx |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-36154-5 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (5) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy begins with [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahakian 1993 59&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sahakian |first=Mabel Lewis |title=Ideas of the great philosophers |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Plato+the+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20Plato%20the%20republic&amp;f=false |page=59 |year=1993 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=1-56619-271-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427-347B.C.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into four categories: [[timocracy]], [[tyranny]], [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahakian 1993 59&quot;/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[Nichomachean Ethics]] and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Aristotle: political philosophy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Aristotle+politics#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20Aristotle%20politics&amp;f=false |page=3 |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-878200-1 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (1) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]], including the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford |first=Robert T. |title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Cicero#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20Cicero&amp;f=false |page=1 |year=2002 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=90-420-1467-1 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (1) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Indian Subcontinent and Hindu Philosophy====
Political philosophy originates in Ancient India with the [[Hindu]] text ''[[Manusmṛti]]'', or ''[[Manu Smriti|Laws of Manu]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]]´s translation is available online as [http://books.google.com/books?id=4caNTgBa6oEC&amp;dq=william+jones+manu&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9POvEvMtnM&amp;sig=wae9WVaVrRNClSPrabH0D-eaG58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 ''The Institutes of Hindu Law: Or, The Ordinances of Manu''], Calcutta: Sewell &amp; Debrett, 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]''. In ''[[Arthashastra]]'', [[Chanakya]] developed a viewpoint which recalls both the Legalists and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html Politics as a Vocation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Christianity===

'''Saint Augustine'''

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. The main change that Christian thought brought was to moderate the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, and emphasize the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that refuted the thesis, after the [[First Sack of Rome]], that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]] at all - a view many Christian Romans held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schall |first=James V. |title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Saint+Augustine#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page= 40 |year=1998 |publisher =CUA Press |isbn=0-8132-0922-7 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Thomas Aquinas'''

In political philosophy, [[Aquinas]] is most meticulous when dealing with varieties of law. According to Aquinas, there are four different kinds of laws:

# God's cosmic law
# God's scriptural law
# Natural law or rules of conduct universally applicable within reason
# Human law or specific rules applicable to specific circumstances.

===Medieval Islam===
'''Mutazilite vs Asharite'''

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and the prophet [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]] - in effect ''all'' philosophy was &quot;[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]&quot; as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the &quot;rationalist&quot; [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the &quot;traditionalist&quot; [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aslan |first=Reza |title=No god but God |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FEfdoRL1rrgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Islam+Mutazilite+and+Asharite+views#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=153 |year=2005 |publisher=Random House Inc. |isbn=1-4000-6213-3 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (3) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]], i.e. the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace), [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), and [[Ibn Khaldun]]. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the &quot;core&quot; terms of the Qur'an, i.e. [[ibadah]], din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]]- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

'''Ibn Khaldun'''

The 14th century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], &quot;an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself&quot;, the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gellner |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Gellner |title=Plough, Sword, and Book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CwZFV7J7Id8C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Gellner+Plough+Sword+and+Book+Ibn+Khaldun%27s+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=239 |year=1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-28702-7 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=(Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best:...)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazalite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koetsier |first=L. S. |title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2SI0I4t9roEC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=political+philosophy+scholasticism#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20scholasticism&amp;f=false |page=19 |year=2004 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1-4120-0738-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of [[natural law]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copleston |first=Frederick |title=A history of philosophy |volume=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=political+philosophy+scholasticism#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20scholasticism&amp;f=false |page=346 |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0-86012-296-8 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valente |first=Claire |title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=political+philosophy+medieval+europe#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=14 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd. |isbn=0-7546-0901-8 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Renaissance===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

'''Niccolò Machiavelli'''

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) could interpret The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian| authorlink =| coauthors =|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince| work =|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|month=February | year=2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm| doi =|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end, i.e. the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copleston |first=Frederick |title=A history of philosophy |volume=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Machiavelli#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20Machiavelli&amp;f=false |pages=310–312 |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0-86012-296-8 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Locke'''

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

===European Age of Enlightenment===
[[Image:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|320px|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time where old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]]) led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[John Locke]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of &quot;state&quot; and &quot;government.&quot; It was decided that &quot;state&quot; would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term &quot;government&quot; would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states which nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ingo |editor1-last=Barens |others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed. |title=Political events and economic ideas |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zSZyQ9TzqQ0C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=political+philosophy+the+enlightenment#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20the%20enlightenment&amp;f=false |pages=206–207 |year=2004 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84376-440-3 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (3) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The publication of [[Denis Diderot]]'s and [[Jean d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]'' marked the crowning intellectual achievement of the epoch. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=James M. |title=Religion and the Enlightenment |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=political+philosophy+the+enlightenment+and+religion#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20the%20enlightenment$20and%20religion&amp;f=false |pages=1–2 |year=1997 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=0-664-25760-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...there emerged groups of [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]]s intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to...established religion...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johansen |first=Bruce Elliott |title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Iroquois+philosophy+Benjamin+Franklin#v=onepage&amp;q=Iroquois%20philosophy%20Benjamin%20Franklin&amp;f=false |page=69 |year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-30010-3 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (3) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...the three-tier system of federalism...is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialization and the Modern Era===
[[Image:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] and his critique of capitalism developed along with [[Friedrich Engels]] proved to be one of the most influential political ideologies of the 20th century through [[Leninism]].]]The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established the principles which would be used by the future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Fidel Castro]]. Although Hegel's philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and Karl Marx's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history.  Marx is said to have declared that on the whole, he was just trying to straighten out [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W.F. Hegel]] who was actually upside down. Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kain |first=Philip J. |title=Marx and modern political theory |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=political+philosophy+Marx#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20philosophy%20Marx&amp;f=false |pages=1–4 |year=1993 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-7866-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, by the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 19th to 20th century.

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]] - and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually) - on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aspalter |first=Christian |title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=social+democratic+parties+win+universal+suffrage#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20democratic%20parties%20win%20universal%20suffrage&amp;f=false |page=70 |year=2001 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=1-56072-975-4 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (4) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a group of central European economists led by [[Austrians]] [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] identified the [[collectivist]] underpinnings to the various new [[socialist]] and [[fascist]] doctrines of government power as being different brands of political [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/etexts/austrian.asp What is Austrian Economics?], [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Ebeling, ''Austrian Economics and the Political Economy of Freedom'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, 163-179 ISBN 1-84064-940-2, ISBN 978-1-84064-940-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary political philosophy==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]]in his book''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Patemen]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a &quot;return to [[Hegel]]&quot;. Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspectives.

[[Charles Blattberg]] has offered an account which distinguishes between four different contemporary political philosophies: neutralism, postmodernism, pluralism, and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117 &quot;Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies,&quot;] in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is fruitful interaction between political philosophers and [[international relations]] theorists. The rise of globalization has created the need for an international normative framework, and political theory has moved to fill the gap.

One of the most prominent subjects in recent political philosophy has been the theory of deliberative democracy. The seminal work is by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]] but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as Jane Mansbridge, Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996).  Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential political philosophers==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are a few of the most [[canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
*[[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
*[[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching, Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
*[[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
*[[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
*[[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty
*[[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's [[Reflections on the Revolution in France]] is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
*[[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of pluralism and agonistic democracy.
*[[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
*[[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique  which then demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
*[[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
*[[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
*[[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
*[[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]] - a mainstay of socialism - would lead to a &quot;total&quot; state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let the spontaneous order develop.
*[[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the &quot;cunning&quot; of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
*[[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
*[[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
*[[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
*[[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
*[[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]
*[[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
*[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
*[[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be “Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]” and “Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]” of the United States.  As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
*[[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of ''[[repressive desublimation]]'', in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
*[[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
*[[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
*[[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
*[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a &quot;balance of powers&quot; in the divisions of a state.
*[[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
*[[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
*[[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in [[Common Sense]] and [[The Rights of Man]].
*[[Plato]]: Along with his mentor, [[Socrates]], and his student, [[Aristotle]], Plato helped to lay the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]].
*[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
*[[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of the philosophical system [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].
*[[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
*[[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others as diverse as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
*[[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior (&quot;the invisible hand&quot;) of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g. repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds outside the economic sphere.
*[[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
*[[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of &quot;[[rational egoism]]&quot;, in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided of reason, political authority would be superfluous.
*[[Max Stirner]]: an important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]]
*[[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
*[[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
*[[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
*[[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy 'In the Beginning was the Deed' has been seen - along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]] - as a key foundational work on Political Realism.
