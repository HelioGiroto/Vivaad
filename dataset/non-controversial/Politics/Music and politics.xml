The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in music, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or even if, general audiences relate music on a political level. Time has shown how music can be used in [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, although pro-establishment ideas are also used, for example in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Unlike many other types of music, political music is not usually ambiguous, and is used to portray a specific political message. Even in the case of overtly political pop acts like U2, the Clash, or Rage Against the Machine, while political message in their music is apparent, it is usually in the political context of the time it was made. This makes understanding the historical events and time that inspired the music essential to fully understanding the message in the music. Since political music is meant to be heard by the people, it is often meant to be popular.

Furthermore it is extremely difficult to predict how audiences will respond this kind of music, sounds, or even visual cues. For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that “counter expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://www.music.ucsb.edu/projects/musicandpolitics/archive/2010-1/pedelty-keefe.html|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The difficulty in predicting and understanding an audience is partly due to the fact that there is an extremely diverse range of styles, and structure involved in musical production, and marketing.

== Art music ==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called &quot;Bonaparte&quot;. In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed &quot;Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man&quot;.

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is sometimes considered to be a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome) - the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.

[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to [[Mikhail Kvardi]]. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised. &quot;Can one actually dance to such music&quot;, said Ivan Yershov. the article claimed it was part of &quot;ideology harmful to the proletariat&quot;&quot;. Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express &quot;the festive mood of peaceful construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, but managed to keep his musical standard high. ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937) is far from banal. [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar. Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the attack of Teutonic knights into the Baltic states. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.

&quot;I don't believe anyone venerates Mussolini more than I&quot; said [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] in 1930 to a Rome newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff|Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of Goebbels, who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''Die Schweigsame Frau'' was banned from 1935–1945 because the librettist, Stefan Zweig, was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Trblinka death camp, new arrivals were presented with a deceptive scene. A ten-piece orchestra played jazz and Jewish folk tunes&lt;ref&gt;''Music in the Holocaust&quot; (2005) by Shirli Gilbert, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Shloyme Klezmer stood by the entrance of the gas chambers and played with the orchestra as the bodies were gassed. He saw his son being led in and pulled him out of the line. As SS officer saw this and laughed. Shloyme smashed his violin over the SS officer's head and marched with his only child into the gas chamber&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Klezmer'' (2002) by Yale Strom, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary classical music==
[[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''War Requiem'' (1962) emphasised the futility of war, by quoting poems by Wilfred Owen. He had previously written a &quot;Pacifist March&quot; in 1937. He had been a [[conscientious objector]] during the Second World War.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}

[[John Adams (composer)|Adams']] opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991) concerns the killing of an American Jew by Palestinian terrorists. The audience had expected to see the demonisation of the terrorists, but instead saw an even-handed treatment of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]].{{Cn|date=October 2012}}&lt;!--Clearly, Taruskin does not substantiate this claim.--&gt; Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused Adams of &quot;romanticizing terrorists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of contemporary classical composers of socialist or Marxist sympathies have attempted in often quite radically different ways to relate their politics to their work. Primary amongst those from the earlier 20th century are [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Hanns Eisler]], both of whom moved away from atonal idioms that had become prominent in their time, feeling these to alienate audiences, towards music and music-theatre that had roots in popular musics (for example cabaret songs), though with sophisticated harmonies that reflected their musical background.{{Cn|date=October 2012}} Of post-war composers, the most significant of the earlier generations were [[Luigi Nono]] and [[Hans Werner Henze]], both of who wrote a wide range of works that combined music with texts, theatre, and electronics relating to political issues viewed from a Marxist perspective (for example to do with events in Cuba, Vietnam and Chile in Nono's work). Nono brought this subject matter into a dialogue with a relatively abstract music derived from his own earlier serial compositions, from his pioneering work ''[[Il canto sospeso]]'' (1956) onwards, whilst Henze relaxed his earlier formalism in favour of a more eclectic approach to musical style, as for example in his large scale cabaret-like work ''Voices'' (1973).{{Cn|date=October 2012}}

A range of slightly later composers in West Germany, including [[Helmut Lachenmann]], [[Nicolaus A. Huber]] (both of whom were students of Nono), and [[Mathias Spahlinger]] responded to political concerns in a more abstract fashion, reflecting to some extent the ideas of Theodor Adorno and writing in opposition to the perceived demands made upon music (in terms of passive listening, audience pleasing, and so on) made by the culture industry. Lachenmann and Spahlinger explored a musical vocabulary derived in large measure from unusual techniques upon instruments, to offer expressive possibilities outside of the boundaries of what Lachenmann called the 'philharmonic tradition'. Huber for a while in the 1970s withdraw from the contemporary concert circuit, instead writing Politische Revuen. Other German composers whose works relate to this tradition, though with a more eclectic use of idiom, include [[Dieter Schnebel]], [[Konrad Boehmer]] and [[Gerhard Stabler]]. Marxist ideas on aesthetic matters could be found in the writings on music by [[Hans G. Helms]] and [[Heinz-Klaus Metzger]].

A thoroughly different approach characterised the late work of the British composer [[Cornelius Cardew]] who, influenced by the writings of [[Christopher Caudwell]] (also alluded to by Lachenmann in his work for two guitars ''Salut für Caudwell'' (1977)) and Mao Tse-Tung, famously denounced the work of the post-war avant-garde with which he had previously been associated, in his book ''Stockhausen Serves Imperialism'' (in which he attacked not just [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] but also the music of John Cage and others). Cardew argued that the atonal music of the avant-garde served to exacerbate the fragmentation of society rather than bringing the masses together; with this in mind he turned to the composition of didactic settings of [[revolutionary song]]s from Ireland, China, and elsewhere. Other composers influenced by Maoism include the Americans [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Frederic Rzewski]] and the Japanese composer-pianist [[Yuji Takahashi]], all of whom also incorporated political song material into their compositions, though without wholly surrendering the other more abstract musical concerns of their earlier work, whilst the British composer [[Dave Smith (composer)|Dave Smith]] continued to some extent in the tradition established by Cardew, as well as frequently making use of the medium of the nineteenth-century melodrama for speaker and piano, with a wide variety of texts relating to issues in Ireland, Palestine, and elsewhere.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}

The British composer [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]] stands apart from other tendencies in that country, working within a radical atonal avant-garde idiom a little in the manner of the German composers mentioned earlier, but equally influenced by other figures including Stockhausen, [[Hans-Joachim Hespos]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]], [[Kagel]], [[Michael Finnissy]] and others. Barrett is concerned to marry together sophistication of musical content with a degree of surface immediacy, thus developing a musical language from fundamental parameters of register, density, dynamics, texture and timbre so as to facilitate the music's surface accessibility to the uninitiated listener.{{Cn|date=October 2012}} Finnissy himself has alluded to politicised topics in various works, especially in his ''English Country-Tunes'', a ravaged musical landscape tinged with moments of nostalgia (not unlike the films of [[Derek Jarman]]), intended as a comment on the hypocrisy and falseness of English pastoralism. The British composer Gordon Downie writes in a highly abstract modernist idiom and in writings links this type of modernism with Marxist concerns.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}&lt;!--And isn't Downie actually a Canadian?--&gt; The British arts journal EONTA, under the editorship of Steven Holt, featured a range of writings on music and other arts from various Marxist perspectives.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}

[[Melissa Dunphy]]'s best-known works take American politics as a theme: the ''Gonzales Cantata'', while not partisan, sets the words of the [[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy hearings]] to neo-Baroque music, and ''What do you think I fought for at Omaha Beach?'' is a choral setting of testimony in support of [[same-sex marriage in Maine]].

Other composers identify with a non-Marxist left, which may embrace non- or anti-authoritarian, left-liberal, Green, or even Anarchist politics. [[John Cage]], for example, was influenced by ideas of [[Henry David Thoreau]] and other [[anarchist]] writers. Cage's concept of an &quot;anarchic harmony&quot; has been taken up by younger composers, including [[Andrew Culver (composer)|Andrew Culver]] and [[Daniel James Wolf]]. Many composers{{Weasel-inline|date=October 2012}} are engaged with environmental issues and may be usefully identified with Green politics.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}

== Folk music ==
The song &quot;[[We Shall Overcome]]&quot; is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularization of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of 20th century, poor working conditions and class struggles lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century &quot;[[Wobblies]]&quot; was [[Joe Hill]]. In the 1940s through the 1960s, [[The Weavers]] as well as [[Woody Guthrie]] were influential in this type of social and political music. Woody Guthrie's &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; is one of the U.S. most famous folk songs and the lyrics describe his sympathetic views of communism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Folk Hero&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's &quot;[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]&quot;, was a popular anti-war protest song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pete Seeger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|Vietnam War era]].  [[Blowin' in the Wind]], by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation. In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK &lt;ref name=&quot;Top Hits 1965&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with &quot;[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]&quot; (by [[Phil Ochs]]). It was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged out of the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and many others. 

The [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] during the [[Cold War]] era produced a number of political folk tunes within the United States and elsewhere. The Revival in the United States began in the 1930s after the [[Great Depression]] as a response to the new wave of modernization that triggered the post-industrial era.&lt;ref name=&quot;30s to 60s folk music revival&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and [[Woody Guthrie]] were crucial in popularizing folk music, and they soon began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began an era of folk music in which artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is [[Lead Belly]]’s “Bourgeois Blues”.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; As the fear of communism began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, folk music began a resurgence in the 1960s as an underground movement.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; During the revival, folk music became popular mostly with college students since universities provided the organization necessary for sustaining music trends and an impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt;  It was at this time that folk artists, such as [[Bob Dylan]], began writing their own songs to fit current times, as opposed to only adapting existing folk songs.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in regard to public opinion about communism. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw communism as a threat. For example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cold War Gallup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Folk music was used outside the United States during this time as well. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Music&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and the once existing [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] by allowing ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 

These folk protest traditions are still being carried on today by many old and new topical songwriters and musicians of all types and varieties. Today's socially conscious musicians not only sing at rallies, demonstrations and on picket lines, but typically have professional web sites and post videos on [[YouTube]] and other popular internet sites. Examples of such activist musicians include [[Ray Korona]] (environmental, labor, peace, social justice), [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]] (labor, social justice) and [[Anne Feeney]] (labor, protest), among many others. Although these musicians each have their own followings and performance circuits, good sources for finding many of them include the [[Peoples Music Network]] for Songs of Freedom and Struggle and the [[Labor Heritage Foundation]].

Blues songs tend to be resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there are a few exceptions. [[Josh White]] recorded &quot;When Am I going to be Called a Man&quot; in 1936. At this time it was common for white men to address black men as &quot;boy&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Silicosis is Killing Me&quot; in 1936. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot; in 1939. With great sophistication, it draws a comparison between fruit on the trees and the rotting corpses of lynched black men. It also exposed American racism, particularly the lynching of African Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including MSG.
[[Paul Robeson]], singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken political views. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a &quot;stop notice&quot; at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labor unions in the U.S. and Canada organized a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the American side of the U.S.-Canada border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled. 

In Communist China, exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtime, a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe, attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico. He was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe. From 1966 to 1970 he underwent &quot;re-education&quot;. In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soul music==
A good example of a political soul song was: &quot;[[Everyday People (song)|Everyday People]]&quot;

==Rock music==
[[Rock the Vote]] is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php &quot;Rock the Vote - About Rock the Vote&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to &quot;build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=/www/story/12-19-2007/0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007,+09:00+AM &quot;AT&amp;T and Rock the Vote Team Up to Engage Young Voters via Mobile Technology Throughout 2008 Election&quot;] December 19, 2007 press release&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rock groups, such as [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], [[Living Colour]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Megadeth]], [[Scars on Broadway]], [[Enter Shikari]], and [[System of a Down]] have openly political messages in their music.

[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]'s [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the underground rock music scene of the late 1960s, and displayed an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with sociopolitical and countercultural lyrics of the era, such as in the songs &quot;Motor City Is Burning&quot; (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|Detroit Insurrection of 1967]]), and &quot;The American Ruse&quot; (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] organizations such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]] (composed of white American [[socialist]]s seeking to assist African Americans in the fight for racial equality - it was ''not'', as the title may suggest, a white supremacist group). MC5 performed a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] held at [[International Amphitheatre]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[1968 Democratic National Convention protests|an infamous riot]] subsequently broke out between police and students [[protest]]ing the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. During the counterculture era, acts like [[John Lennon]] commonly protested in his music, with latter devoting [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and the song [[Imagine (song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Imagine's lyrics talk about &quot;giving peace a chance&quot; and Imagine also deals with imagining a world without countries or religion. 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] sang to his fans about the evils of war and the emptiness of consumerism when he released his trade mark album “[[The Times They are A-Changin]]’” which became one of his number one albums containing one of his number one songs. This song was articulating the movement of social change and that history will always repeat itself. When he sang the lyrics “Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen and keep your eyes wide, the chance won’t come again. And don’t speak too soon, for the wheel’s still in spin.” He achieved the attention of the civil rights movement which helped in the transformation of the American political landscape.
	Like any other musical artist, Dylan was influenced by other radical groups such as the [[Wobblies]]- the popular group of the thirties and forties, the Beat Anarchists of the fifties, and above all, by the political beliefs of young people during the civil rights movement. In his songs, he included the terror of the nuclear arms race, poverty, racism, prison, [[jingoism]], and war. With his songs, he helped with the political revolution of America in the 1960s.

===Punk rock===
{{Main|Punk ideologies}}

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various [[left-wing]] or [[anti-establishment]] ideologies, including [[anarchism]] and [[socialism]]: punk's culture of [[DIY]] and disregard for musical virtuosity held an obvious attraction for those on the left - mirroring as it does workers' control of the means of production, and empowerment of the powerless (though some leftists, it can be argued, may see the [[DIY ethic]] as just another form of [[private enterprise]]) - and the genre as a whole came, largely through the [[Sex Pistols]] to be associated with anarchism. The sincerity of many of these bands has been questioned - many saw the use of anarchism in early punk as a joke or fashion statement more than an ideology (indeed, some lefist critics of punk saw it as &quot;just another rock'n'roll pose&quot;) - but over time bands such as [[Crass]] in the UK and [[Dead Kennedys]] in America emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened. [[New wave music|New Wave]], however, and many punk bands who were a major influence on its development, such as Blondie, Television, and XTC eschewed this political aspect of punk.
Notable punk rock artists such as [[The Clash]], [[Crass]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Millions of Dead Cops]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Green Day]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have been known to use political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, colonialism, and other social conflicts they see as problems in society. 

The Sex Pistols song &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was banned from broadcast by the BBC due to perceptions that it was anti-monarchy. This song was highly controversial, firstly for it equation of the queen with a &quot; Fascist regime&quot; and secondly for its claim that England had &quot;no future&quot;. The Crass album ''[[The Feeding Of the 5000]]'' almost was not released because workers in the plants refused to release it due to sacrilegious lyrical content (the band were [[Anti-Christian]]), and later Crass albums were banned. Crass eventually even ended up in court on charges of obscenity, similar to what later happened in the USA to the Dead Kennedys over their ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' album artwork. 

Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have even ran as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. Also, several musicians such as [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Crashdog]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Tim McIlrath]], [[Bad Religion]], and the [[Dropkick Murphys]] were politically [[center-left]] and [[social liberal|liberal]]. 

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], held [[right-wing]] and [[Rock Against Communism|anti-communist]] stances, and were often dismissed or reviled in the broader, largely leftist punk subculture.

Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]]. Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]].

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
[[Racist music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is tied to the early 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremisist groups include &quot;subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 0-275-99569-0, ISBN 978-0-275-99569-0, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] &quot;racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the Internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html &quot;Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment&quot;], ''[[Cyber racism]]'' ,Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, ISBN 0-237-52717-0, ISBN 978-0-237-52717-4, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is &quot;a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched &quot;Project Schoolyard&quot; to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, &quot;We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm &quot;Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists&quot;], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, &quot;Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html &quot;Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools&quot;], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hip hop ==
[[Racism]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]] are common themes in [[hip hop music]].  Sub-genres of hip hop centered around political messages have emerged, including [[political hip hop|political]] and [[conscious hip hop]].

[[Hip hop music|Rap]] artist Sean &quot;[[P Diddy]]&quot; Combs led &quot;[[Vote or Die]]&quot;, a not-for-profit organization, arose the 2004 elections that was geared to draw more youthful voters into the polls. The &quot;Vote or Die&quot; campaign may have helped directly contribute to increased youth vote demographic (age 18-29) which saw an increase in participation to 20.9 million votes - up from 16.2 million in 2000. The overall turnout for the age group increased as well. 51 percent of citizens ages 18 to 29 voted in 2004. 42.3 percent voted in 2000.

[[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] was known for their politically charged lyrics, especially for their album, ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'', and the song &quot;[[Fight the Power]]&quot;. Frontman [[Chuck D]] is the main advocate for political awareness in the group.

[[:Category:Female rappers|Female rappers]] who write about experiences specific to their lives expand the dominant ideas of rap music and dominant notions of what it means to be an authentic rapper. Because their voices are considered a minority.{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} They also bring to the forefront images of women with agency over their own bodies, sexuality, and lives, without constructing themselves as in opposition to male rappers, a stance that would alienate them from the hip hop community. 

There are more male than female performers and listeners; women also identify with these male rappers on a number of different levels.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Brand Nubian]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Dead Prez]], and [[The Coup]] are all noted for their political views and lyrics. 

To a certain extent, the emphasis of making money and the [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] can be considered{{By whom|date=February 2012}} [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning stances]], which are prevalent throughout hip hop, especially in [[gangsta rap]], although these subjects are probably not meant to be political, but rather the artist bragging about his or her street credibility.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Tupac Shakur]]'s debut album ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' generated significant controversy stemming from then Vice President [[Dan Quayle]]'s public criticism after a youth in Texas shot a state trooper and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by the album and its strong theme of police brutality. Quayle made the statement, &quot;There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.&quot;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of &quot;[[tradition]]al&quot; life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s &quot;[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]&quot; have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] &quot;[[hippie]]s&quot; and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, &quot;Country Music U.S.A,&quot; 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, Haggard has become more openly critical of &quot;[[the establishment]]&quot;, and even disagreed with the [[Iraq War]]. Other country musicians, such as [[Charlie Daniels]], openly supported George W. Bush, the Iraq War, and [[Conservatism|conservative]] politics in general. When [[Natalie Maines]], lead singer of the [[Dixie Chicks]], made negative comments about George W. Bush and publicly spoke out against the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, boycotts by country music radio stations and death threats hindered the band's continued success. In 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released a &quot;comeback&quot; album, ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].

==Comedy music==
Through the years, there have been numerous songs that have made fun of politicians and/or politics in general. One such group in the modern era primarily dedicated to political music and satire is the [[Capitol Steps]]. [[Tenacious D]] also features several songs with political themes.

==New musicology==
[[New musicology]] is the [[cultural studies|cultural study]], analysis, and criticism of music. It is often based on the work of [[Theodor Adorno]] (and [[Walter Benjamin]]) and [[feminist]], [[gender studies]], or [[Post-colonialism|postcolonial]] hypotheses. As [[Susan McClary]] says, &quot;musicology fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship&quot;, including politics.
