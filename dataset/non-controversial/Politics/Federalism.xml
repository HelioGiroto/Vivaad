{{Politics}} 
'''Federalism''' is a [[political]] concept in which a ''group'' of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: ''foedus'', [[wikt:covenant|covenant]]) with a governing [[federal headship|representative head]]. The term &quot;federalism&quot; is also used to describe a system of [[government]] in which [[sovereignty]] is [[constitution]]ally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon [[democratic]] rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a '''[[federation]]'''. Proponents are often called [[federalist]]s.

==European vs. American Federalism==

In [[#Federalism in Europe|Europe]], &quot;federalist&quot; is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. Most European federalists want this development to continue within the [[European Union]]. European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was [[Winston Churchill]]'s  speech in [[Zurich]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html   Winston Churchill's  speech in Zurich in 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[#United States|United States]], federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government.  When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the [[Federalist Party]] supported a stronger central government, while &quot;[[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]&quot; wanted a weaker central government.  This is very different from the modern usage of &quot;federalism&quot; in Europe, and in the United States.  The distinction stems from the fact that &quot;federalism&quot; is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a [[confederacy]] and a [[unitary state]].  The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the [[Articles of Confederation]], under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.  Further, during the [[American Civil War]], members of the [[Confederate States of America]], which seceded in favor of a weaker central government, referred to pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers of the United States government as &quot;[[Union Army|Federals]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Federal+soldier Free Dictionary: Federal soldier]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in the United States &quot;federalism&quot; argued for a stronger central government, relative to a confederacy.  

In contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European &quot;federalism&quot; argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state.  The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense.  As the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] intended.  Most people politically advocating &quot;federalism&quot; in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the [[Courts of the United States|judiciary]] (see [[Federalist Society]], [[New Federalism]]). 

In [[#Canada|Canada]], federalism typically implies opposition to [[Souverainism|sovereigntist]] movements (most commonly [[Quebec separatism]]).

The governments of [[Argentina]], [[#Australia|Australia]], [[#Brazil|Brazil]], [[#India|India]] and [[#Mexico|Mexico]], among others, are also organized along federalist principles.

Federalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in [[Belgium#Communities and regions|Belgium]] or [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a [[confederation]] in actuality.

In 1999, the [[Government of Canada]] established the [[Forum of Federations]] as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in [[Ottawa]], the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Canada, [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], India, [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Switzerland]].

Some [[Christian denomination]]s are organized on federalist principles; in these churches this is known as ''ecclesiastic'' or ''theological federalism''.

==Examples of federalism==

===United States===
{{Main|Federalism in the United States}}

Federalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between [[state legislature (United States)|state governments]] and the [[federal government of the United States]]. American government has evolved from a system of dual federalism to one of associative federalism. In &quot;Federalist No. 46,&quot; James Madison asserted that the states and national government &quot;are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers.&quot; Alexander Hamilton, writing in &quot;Federalist No. 28,&quot; suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: &quot;If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.&quot; ([http://www.learner.org/courses/democracyinamerica/dia_3/dia_3_topic.html 1])
[[File:Map of USA with state names.svg|thumb|300px|left|The United States is composed of fifty self-governing states and several territories.]]

Because the states were preexisting political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to  the federal government. The federal government has certain ''express powers'' (also called ''[[enumerated  powers]]'') which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the ''[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]'' gives the federal government the ''implied power'' to pass any law &quot;necessary and proper&quot; for the execution of its express powers. Other powers&amp;mdash;the ''[[Reserve power|reserved powers]]''&amp;mdash;are reserved to the people or the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/constitution/supreme.htm|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA With Explanatory Notes|accessdate=|publisher=U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in [[McCulloch v. Maryland]] (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and by some later amendments—as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.

The [[Federalist party]] of the United States were opposed by the [[Democratic-Republicans]], including powerful figures such as [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that:
#The Legislative had too much power (mainly because of the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]]) and that they were unchecked.
#The Executive branch had too much power, and that there was no check on him. A dictator would arise.
#A bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a dictator (then believed to eventually be the president) from exploiting citizens. The federalists, on the other hand, argued that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.

After the [[American Civil War]], the federal government increased greatly in influence on everyday life and in size relative to the state governments. Reasons included the need to regulate businesses and industries that span state borders, attempts to secure civil rights, and the provision of social services.  The federal government acquired no substantial new powers until the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]].

From 1938 until 1995, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress' power under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers, such as the [[Commerce Clause]], whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years. In 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] in the Lopez decision, and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] in the ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' decision. Recently, the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' decision.

[[Dual federalism]] holds that the federal government and the state governments are co-equals, each sovereign. 

However, since the Civil War Era, the national courts often interpret the federal government as the final judge of its own powers under dual federalism. The establishment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] governments (which are [[Indian country|separate and distinct]] from state and federal government) exercising limited powers of [[Tribal sovereignty|sovereignty]], has given rise to the concept of &quot;bi-federalism.&quot;

===&lt;span id=&quot;Europe&quot;&gt;Federalism in Europe&lt;/span&gt;===&lt;!--[[F word]] links here--&gt; 

Several federal systems exist in [[Europe]], such as in [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Federalism in Germany|Germany]], [[#Belgium|Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[European Union]]. Germany and the EU are the only examples in the world where members of the federal upper houses, (the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] and the [[European Council|Council]]), are neither elected nor appointed but are composed of the governments of their constituents.

In Germany, federalism was abolished only during [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]] (1933–1945) and in [[East Germany]] during most of its existence (1952–1990). [[Adolf Hitler]] viewed federalism as an obstacle to his goals. As he wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', &quot;[[Nazism|National Socialism]] must claim the right to impose its principles on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of federal states.&quot;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Therefore the idea of a strong, centralized government has negative associations in German politics, although prior to [[Weimar Republic|1919]] or [[Enabling Act of 1933|1933]], many social democrats and liberals favored [[centralization]] in principle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Since earlier in Britain, an [[Imperial Federation]] was once seen as a method of solving the [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] problem in Ireland, federalism has long been proposed as a solution to the &quot;[[The Irish Problem|Irish Problem]]&quot;, and more lately, the &quot;[[West Lothian question]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/82358.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics The West Lothian Question|date=1 June 1998|accessdate=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
[[File:LocationEuropeanUnion27.png|thumb|right|States of [[European Union]].]]
Following the end of [[World War II]], several movements began advocating a European federation, such as the [[Union of European Federalists]] or the [[European Movement]], founded in 1948. Those organizations were influential in the European unification process, but never in a decisive way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Although federalism was mentioned both in the drafts of the [[Maastricht treaty]] and the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], it was never adopted by the representatives of the member countries, all of whom would have to agree to the term. The strongest advocates of European federalism have been [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] while those historically most strongly opposed have been the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]; while other countries that have never campaigned specifically for a particular means of governance in Europe are considered as federalists.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Some would consider this to be the case with states such as [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], and [[Hungary]]. It is also remarkable that in recent times the French government has become increasingly pro-European Union, while countries like the [[Czech Republic]] have taken on the roles of primary opponents to a stronger EU.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

{{quote|Those uncomfortable using the “F” word in the EU context should feel free to refer to it as a quasi-federal or federal-like system. Nevertheless, for the purposes of the analysis here, the EU has the necessary attributes of a federal system. It is striking that while many scholars of the EU continue to resist analyzing it as a federation, most contemporary students of federalism view the EU as a federal system (See for instance, Bednar, Filippov et al., McKay, Kelemen, Defigueido and Weingast). (R. Daniel Kelemen)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kelemen | first = R. Daniel | title = Built to Last?

===Australia===
{{Main|Federalism in Australia}}
[[File:Australia location map recolored.png|thumb|250px|The States and Territories of Australia, consisting of The Australian Capital Territory (red), New South Wales (pink), Northern Territory (yellow, top), Queensland (blue), South Australia (purple), Tasmania (yellow, bottom), Victoria (green), and Western Australia (orange).]]
On January 1, 1901 the [[Australia|Australian nation]] emerged as a federation. The [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] was colonized by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1788, who subsequently established six self-governing colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held [[referendums]] on becoming a unified, independent nation. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the [[Federation of Australia]] commenced, resulting in the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901. Whilst the Federation of Australia emerged in 1901, the States of Australia remained colonies of Britain until 1986 when the UK and Australia passed the ''Australia Acts''. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, though through a [[Westminster system]].

===Brazil===
[[File:Brazil Political Map.svg|thumb|left|Brazil is a union of 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and one [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]], which is the site of the federal capital, [[Brasília]].]]
{{See also|States of Brazil}}
In [[Brazil]], the fall of the [[Empire of Brazil|monarchy]] in 1889 by a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' led to the rise of the [[presidential system]], headed by [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]. Aided by well-known jurist [[Ruy Barbosa]], Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]] since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 Constitution, for example, granted the [[Government of Brazil|federal government]] the authority to appoint State Governors (called [[Federal intervention|interventors]]) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President [[Getúlio Vargas]]. Brazil also uses the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade.

The [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] introduced a new component to the ideas of federalism, including [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] as federal entities. Brazilian municipalities are now invested with some of the traditional powers usually granted to states in federalism, and although they are not allowed to have a Constitution, they are structured by an [[organic law]].

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian federalism}}
In Canada, the system of federalism is described by the division of powers between the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and the country's [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] governments.  Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution Act]] (previously known as the [[British North America Act]]) of 1867, specific powers of legislation are allotted.  Section 91 of the constitution gives rise to federal authority for legislation, whereas section 92 gives rise to provincial powers.

For matters not directly dealt with in the constitution, the federal government retains residual powers; however, conflict between the two levels of government, relating to which level has legislative jurisdiction over various matters, has been a longstanding and evolving issue.  Areas of contest include legislation with respect to regulation of the economy, taxation, and natural resources.

===Colombia===
The [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)]] destroyed the newly formed [[Granadine Confederation]] and created the [[United States of Colombia]] on similarly federal theories, though their actual policies generally differed.

===Venezuela===
The [[Federal War]] ended in 1863 with the signing of the Treaty of Coche by both the centralist government of the time and the Federal Forces.  The [[United States of Venezuela]] were subsequently incorporated under a &quot;Federation of Sovereign States&quot; upon principles borrowed from the [[Articles of Confederation]] of the United States of America. In this Federation, each State had a &quot;President&quot; of its own that controlled almost every issue, even the creation of &quot;State Armies,&quot; while the Federal Army was required to obtain presidential permission to enter any given state.

However, more than 140 years later, the original system has gradually evolved into a quasi-centralist form of government. While the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 Constitution]] still defines Venezuela as a Federal Republic, it abolished the Senate, transferred competences of the States to the Federal Government and granted the President of the Republic vast powers to intervene in the States and Municipalities.

===India===
{{Main|Federalism in India}}
[[File:Indian states by ruling party.png|thumb|left|Indian state governments led by various political parties]]

The [[Government of India]] (referred to as the ''Union Government'') was established by the [[Constitution of India]], and is the governing authority of a ''federal union'' of [[States and territories of India|28 states and 7 union territories]].

The governance of India is based on a tiered system, where in the [[Constitution of India]] appropriates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers. The Constitution uses the Seventh Schedule to delimit the subjects under three categories, namely the Union list, the State list and the Concurrent list.

====Asymmetric federalism====
A distinguishing aspect of Indian federalism is that unlike many other forms of federalism, it is asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncert.nic.in/book_publishing/CLASS%2011/Indian%20Constitution%20at%20work/chap10.pdf Indian Constitution at Work] ''The Philosophy of the Constitution'', NCERT, Pg. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Article 370]] makes special provisions for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per its [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]]. Article 371 makes special provisions for the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Goa]], [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Sikkim]] as per their accession or state-hood deals. Also one more aspect of Indian federalism is system of [[President's Rule]] in which the central government (through its appointed Governor) takes control of state's administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state.

====Coalition politics====
Although the Constitution does not say so, India is now a multilingual federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncert&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncert.nic.in/book_publishing/CLASS%2011/Indian%20Constitution%20at%20work/chap10.pdf Indian Constitution at Work] ''The Philosophy of the Constitution'', NCERT, Pg. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; India has a multi-party system,with political allegiances frequently based on linguistic, regional and caste identities,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A &quot;Federalism: The Indian Experience &quot;, HSRC Press,1996, Pg 3, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; necessitating coalition politics, especially at the [[Government of India|Union]] level.Coalition politics have created a balance in the legislatures.
{{-}}

===Russian Federation===
{{main|Russian federalism}}
The post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the USSR (of which Russia was governed as part). It was liberalized in the aftermath of the Soviet Union, with the reforms under [[Boris Yeltsin]] preserving much of the Soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects (while also coming into conflict with Chechen secessionist rebels during the [[Chechen War]]). Some of the reforms under Yeltsin were scaled back by [[Vladimir Putin]].

All of Russia's subdivisional entities are known as subjects, with some smaller entities, such as the republics enjoying more autonomy than other subjects on account of having an extant presence of a culturally non-Russian ethnic minority.

===Federalism with two components===

====Belgium====
{{Importance-section|date=September 2009}}
:''Main articles: [[Belgian federal government]], [[Belgian federal parliament]] and [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium]]''

Federalism in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] is an evolving system. Belgian federalism reflects both the [[Languages of Belgium|linguistic communities]] ([[French Community of Belgium|French]] and [[Flemish Community|Dutch]], and to a lesser extent [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German]]) and the economic regions ([[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]). These correspond to [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|the language areas in Belgium]]. Although officially there are three language areas, for all practical purposes only two languages are relevant on the federal level, Dutch and French:

* [[Brussels]] is officially a bilingual area, but it has a [[Frenchification of Brussels|French-speaking majority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.brusselsstudies.be/PDF/NL_51_BruS13NL.pdf ”Taalgebruik in Brussel en de plaats van het Nederlands. Enkele recente bevindingen”], Rudi Janssens, Brussels Studies, Nummer 13, 7 January 2008 (see page 4).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flanders]] is the region associated with the Belgium's [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking majority, i.e. the [[Flemish Community]].
* Due to its relatively small size (approximately one percent) the German-speaking Community of Belgium does not have much influence on national politics.
* [[Wallonia]] is a French-speaking area, except for the [[East Cantons]]. French is the second most spoken first language in Belgium, following Dutch. Within the French-speaking Community of Belgium, there is a geographical and political distinction between Wallonia and Brussels for historical and sociological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Historically, the Walloons were for a federalism with three components and the Flemings for two. (See: Witte, Els &amp; Craeybeckx, Jan. Politieke geschiedenis van België. Antwerpen, SWU, pp. 455, 459-460.) This difference is one of the elements which makes the Belgian issue so complicated. The Flemings wanted to defend their language while the Walloons wanted to defend their economy: ''It is true that the Walloon movement, which has never stopped affirming that Wallonia is part of the French cultural area, has never made this cultural struggle a priority, being more concerned to struggle against its status as a political minority and the economic decline which was only a corollary to it''. ([http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/Wallonie_Politique/1995_Destatte_Philippe_Wallonia-Identity.htm Wallonia today - The search for an identity without nationalist mania  - (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand, this means that the [[Politics in Belgium|Belgian political landscape]], generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language [[List of political parties in Belgium|political parties]], and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Picqué]], Minister-President of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] said in a September, 2008  declaration in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] at the National Walloon Feast : ''It is, besides, impossible to have a debate about the institutions of Belgium in which Brussels would be excluded.''  (French ''Il n'est d'ailleurs, pas question d'imaginer un débat institutionnel dont Bruxelles serait exclu.'' [http://www.actu24.be/article/regions/regionbruxelles/infosbxl/fetes_de_wallonie_picque_emu_par_linvitation_lancee_a_bruxelles/182803.aspx]) The [[Brussels-Capital Region]] has claimed and obtained a special place in the current negotiations about the reformation of the Belgian state. (French ''Pendant 18 ans, Bruxelles est demeurée sans statut (...) L'absence de statut pour Bruxelles s'expliquait par la différence de vision que partis flamands et partis francophones en avaient: [les partis flamands étaient] allergiques à la notion de Région (...) les francophones (...) considéraient que Bruxelles devait devenir une Région à part entière (...) Les partis flamands ont accepté [en 1988] la création d'une troisième Région et l'exercice par celle-ci des mêmes compétences que celles des deux autres...'' C.E. Lagasse, ''Les nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe'', Erasme, Namur, 2003, pp. 177- 178 ISBN )&lt;/ref&gt; This specific dual form of federalism, with the special position of Brussels, consequentially has a number of political issues—even minor ones—that are being fought out over the Dutch/French-language political division. With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise. This tendency gives this dual federalism model a number of traits that generally are ascribed to [[Confederation|confederalism]], and makes the future of Belgian federalism contentious.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://concise.britannica.com/dday/print?articleId=106096&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9680 |title=Brussels |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French |url=http://info.france2.fr/dossiers/europe/34025346-fr.php?page=2 |title=Bruxelles dans l'oeil du cyclone |publisher=[[France 2]] |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Belgian federalism is federated with three components. An affirmative resolution concerning Brussels' place in the federal system passed in the parliaments of  [[Wallonia]] and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/434274/les-wallons-pour-un-federalisme-a-trois.html [[La Libre Belgique]] 17 juillet 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lalibre.be&quot;&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/434733/bruxelles-soutien-massif-pour-une-participation-de-la-region.html [[La Libre Belgique]], 19 juillet 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; These resolutions passed against the desires of Dutch-speaking parties, who are generally in favour of a federal system with two components (i.e. the Dutch and French Communities of Belgium).  However, the Flemish representatives in the [[Parliament of the Brussels Capital-Region]] voted in favour of the Brussels resolution, with the exception of [[Vlaams Belang|one party]]. The chairman of the [[Walloon Parliament]] stated on July 17, 2008 that, &quot;''Brussels would take an  attitude''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/72-56-20081/jose-happart-demande-a-bruxelles-de-se--positionner-.html Le Vif]&lt;/ref&gt; Brussels' parliament passed the resolution on July 18, 2008:

:''The Parliament of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]  approves with great majority a resolution claiming the presence of Brussels itself at the negotiations  of the reformation of the Belgian State.''&lt;ref name=&quot;lalibre.be&quot;/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;July 18, 2008&lt;/sup&gt;

This aspect of Belgian federalism helps to explain the difficulties of [[Partition of Belgium|partition]]; Brussels, with its importance, is linked to both Wallonia and Flanders and [[vice-versa]]. This situation, however, does not erase the traits of a confederation in the Belgian system.

===Proposed federalism===
It has been proposed in several [[unitary state]]s to establish a federal system, for various reasons. 

====China====
{{main|Federalism in China}}
[[China]] is the largest unitary state in the world by both population and land area. Although China has had long periods of central rule for centuries, it is often argued that the unitary structure of the Chinese government is far too unwieldy to effectively and equitably manage the country's affairs. On the other hand, [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalists]] are suspicious of decentralization as a form of secessionism and a backdoor for national disunity; still others argue that the degree of autonomy given to [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|provincial]]-level officials in the People's Republic of China amounts to a ''de facto'' federalism.

====Libya====
Shortly after the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], some in the eastern region of the country ([[Cyrenaica]]) began to call for the new regime to be federal, with the traditional three regions of [[Libya]] (Cyrenaica, [[Tripolitania]], and [[Fezzan]]) being the constituent units. A group calling itself the Cyrenaican Transitional Council issued a declaration of autonomy on 6 March 2012; this move was rejected by the [[National Transitional Council]] in [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Libya declares autonomy |newspaper=Russia Today |url=http://rt.com/news/libya-split-cyrenaica-autonomy-971/|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Libya declares semiautonomous region |agency=The Associated Press |work=Google News|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iklOh4sVKKczlfYNiqahD915lANQ?docId=0b4e6704e5574d8bba64dc44571b9b21 |accessdate=6 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/09/us-libya-east-autonomy-idUSBRE82814020120309 | work=Reuters | title=Thousands rally in Libya against autonomy for east | date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/libyan-leader-says-autonomy-call-a-foreign-plot/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federalism as the Anarchist Mode of Political Organization==

[[Anarchists]] are against the State but are not against political organization or &quot;governance&quot; -- so long as it is self-governance utilizing [[direct democracy]]. The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or [[confederalism]].{{cn|date=July 2012}} However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'':

:&quot;The social and political structure of anarchy is similar to that of the economic structure, i.e., it is based on a voluntary federation of decentralised, directly democratic policy-making bodies. These are the neighbourhood and community assemblies and their confederations. In these grassroots political units, the concept of &quot;self-management&quot; becomes that of &quot;self-government&quot;, a form of municipal organisation in which people take back control of their living places from the bureaucratic state and the capitalist class whose interests it serves.
:[...]
:The key to that change, from the anarchist standpoint, is the creation of a network of participatory communities based on self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots neighbourhood and community assemblies [meetings for discussion, debate, and decision making].
:[...]
:Since not all issues are local, the neighbourhood and community assemblies will also elect mandated and recallable delegates to the larger-scale units of self-government in order to address issues affecting larger areas, such as urban districts, the city or town as a whole, the county, the bio-region, and ultimately the entire planet. Thus the assemblies will confederate at several levels in order to develop and co-ordinate common policies to deal with common problems.
:[...]
:This need for co-operation does not imply a centralised body. To exercise your autonomy by joining self-managing organisations and, therefore, agreeing to abide by the decisions you help make is not a denial of that autonomy (unlike joining a hierarchical structure, where you forsake autonomy within the organisation). In a centralised system, we must stress, power rests at the top and the role of those below is simply to obey (it matters not if those with the power are elected or not, the principle is the same). In a federal system, power is not delegated into the hands of a few (obviously a &quot;federal&quot; government or state is a centralised system). Decisions in a federal system are made at the base of the organisation and flow upwards so ensuring that power remains decentralised in the hands of all. Working together to solve common problems and organise common efforts to reach common goals is not centralisation and those who confuse the two make a serious error -- they fail to understand the different relations of authority each generates and confuse obedience with co-operation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anarchist Writers. &quot;I.5 What could the social structure of anarchy look like?&quot; An Anarchist FAQ. http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian Church==
Federalism also finds expression in [[ecclesiology]] (the [[doctrine]] of the [[Christian Church|church]]).  For example, [[presbyterian church governance]] resembles [[parliament]]ary [[republicanism]] (a form of ''political federalism'') to a large extent.  In [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denominations, the local church is ruled by elected [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s, some of which are [[minister of religion|minister]]ial.  Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to [[Presbytery (presbyterian church)|presbyteries]] and further to a [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]].  Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.  In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself.  As in ''political federalism'', in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.

Other ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational ecclesiology]], and even in more hierarchical [[Episcopalian church governance|episcopal ecclesiology]].

Some Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to [[Covenant Theology|theological federalism]]) is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] federalism found in the [[Bible]].  They point to the structure of the early [[Christian Church]] as described (and to many, prescribed) in the [[New Testament]].  This is particularly demonstrated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]], described in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] chapter 15, where the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Elder (religious)|elders]] gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.  To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.

==Constitutional structure==

===Division of powers===

{{distinguish|Separation of powers}}

In a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the [[constitution]]. It is in this way that the right to self-government of the component states is usually constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.

In almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the [[states of Germany]] retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]'s agreement to join the [[German Empire]] in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another.
The constitutions of [[Grundgesetz|Germany]] and the [[United States Constitution|United States]] provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like [[Constitution of Canada|Canada]] and [[Constitution of India|India]], on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.  Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state are retained by the constituent states.

[[Image:Political map of Canada.png|thumb|right|240px|In [[Canada]], the provincial governments derive all their powers directly from the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]]. In contrast, the [[Territories of Canada|territories]] are subordinate to the federal government and are delegated powers by it.]]

Where every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. [[Asymmetric federalism]] exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, &quot;historical communities&quot; such as [[Navarre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]], and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] have more powers than other autonomous communities, partly to deal with their distinctness and to appease nationalist leanings, partly out of respect of privileges granted earlier in history.

It is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.

Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. [[Brazil]] is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (''municípios'') with their own legislative council (''câmara de vereadores'') and a mayor (''prefeito''), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a &quot;little constitution&quot;, called &quot;organic law&quot; (''lei orgânica''). [[Mexico]] is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (''municipio libre'', &quot;free municipality&quot;) is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the [[political divisions of Mexico|constituent states]]. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.

Federations often employ the [[paradox]] of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the [[United States constitution|US Constitution]]) wrote in [[Federalist No. 39|Federalist Paper No. 39]] that the US Constitution &quot;is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...&quot; This stems from the fact that states in a federation maintain all [[sovereignty]] that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.

===Organs of government===

The structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as '[[intrastate federalism]]', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a [[bicameral]] legislature the [[upper house]] is often used to represent the component states while the [[lower house]] represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of [[apportionment (politics)|apportionment]], as is the case in the [[senate]]s of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.

Alternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|German Bundesrat]] and in the [[Council of the European Union]]. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.

In Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A [[First Ministers conference]] of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the [[de facto]] highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.

Federations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a ''double majority''.

Some federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states.  Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarchy]] would require unanimous consent of the provinces.  The [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.

===Other technical terms===

* [[Fiscal federalism]] – federalism involving the transfer of funds between different levels of government.
* Formal federalism (or '[[constitutional federalism]]') – the delineation of powers is specified in a written constitution.
* [[Executive federalism]] (also known as 'administrative federalism').

==Federalism as a political philosophy==

{{Main|Federalism|Federalist}}

The meaning of ''federalism'', as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can be either centralising or decentralising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as 'federalists' in the United States and Australia were those who advocated the creation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists are mostly those who seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the 'federalist' force is dedicated to keeping Quebec inside Canada.
