The '''International Socialist Organization''' (ISO) is a [[revolutionary socialist]] organization in the [[United States]] that identifies with [[Trotskyism]], and the [[Marxist]] political tradition of &quot;[[socialism from below]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper: ''[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm The Two Souls of Socialism]'', 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

The ISO advocates replacing the capitalist system with [[socialism]], a system in which society's collective wealth and resources would be democratically controlled to meet human need by those who produce that wealth: the working class. To achieve socialism, the ISO argues that the [[working class]] majority must lead a revolutionary transformation of society into a workers' democracy.Â As an [[anti-Stalinist left]] organization, the ISO opposes state bureaucracy and all forms of &quot;top-down&quot; socialism.

Because capitalism is a global system, the ISO argues that the struggle for socialism must be international in scope. The ISO holds that the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]], as well as [[China]] and [[Cuba]], are examples of bureaucratic class-stratified societies rather than socialism. While the ISO supports struggles for economic, political, and social reforms, it also maintains that exploitation, oppression, war, and environmental destruction cannot be eliminated until capitalism is overthrown and replaced with socialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/where-we-stand Where We Stand], SocialistWorker.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==

The ISO identifies itself as a Marxist organization, and advocates the emancipation of the working class and the oppressed through a revolutionary transformation of society. It advocates democratic control of the economy via grassroots networks of representative workplace and community councils. While it supports existing [[trade unions]] as essential components of workers' struggles, it maintains that workers need to organize themselves independently of the trade union officialdom. The ISO also maintains that racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression are perpetuated by the capitalist system to keep the working class divided against itself, and therefore participates in a wide range of social movements and struggles for social equality and civil rights. The ISO identifies itself as a Leninist organization because it calls for the formation of a revolutionary party by the most militant workers, and states that it is committed to playing a role in helping to build the foundations for such a party.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot; /&gt;

==History==
	 
The ISO originated in 1976 among a number of groups in the [[International Socialists (US)|International Socialists]] (IS) that were growing increasingly critical of the organization's leadership.  Among them was the self-identified ''Left Faction,'' which was led by [[Cal Winslow|Cal]] and [[Barbara Winslow]] and supported by the IS's [[International Socialists (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|British]] members.  The Left Faction and its international supporters maintained that the IS's leadership had acquired a top-down style of operating that depoliticized the organization and placed too much emphasis on sending student activists into working class employment (a tactic referred to as &quot;industrialization&quot;). These disputes followed the disagreements over the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 revolution in Portugal]].  In 1977, the Left Faction was expelled from the IS, and immediately formed the International Socialist Organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisk&quot;&gt;

Some of the political theories adopted by the ISO had been developed in the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|British Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), including that of [[state capitalism]]. State capitalist theory identifies the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc as exploitative class societies driven by military competition with private Western capitalism, rather than as the [[deformed workers' states]] that Trotsky maintained they were in ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliff&quot;&gt;

Having a small membership in the 1980s, the ISO found that its primary organizing efforts toward [[rank and file]] work in the unions was unsustainable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} From the early 1980s, the group began organizing and recruiting on university campuses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The decision to focus primarily on students was regarded as a necessary retreat, given the conservative nature of the [[History of the United States (1980-1988)|Reagan era]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In the 1990s the ISO expanded{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and participated in a series of movements and campaigns, including the movement against the first [[Gulf War]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and other [[List of U.S. foreign interventions since 1945|US military interventions]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} against [[racism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;

In 2001 the ISO was expelled from the [[International Socialist Tendency]] (IST) after a dispute with the British SWP. This dispute was framed by the SWP as a critique of the ISO's conservative approach to the anti-corporate/anti-capitalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Crawford, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Ted.html &quot;Split in the IST&quot;], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO disputed this claim and criticized the SWP for maintaining what the ISO viewed as an exaggerated perspective for the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Iso.html &quot;The ISO (US) and the International Socialist Tendency&quot;], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2012-2-12)&lt;/ref&gt; which the SWP characterized as 'the 1930s in slow motion.'&lt;ref&gt;SWP Central committee, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext19/Swp.html &quot;Statement on Relations Between the SWP (GB) and the ISO (US)&quot;], ''What Next?'', No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After some years with very little contact between the ISO and the British SWP, relations have improved. [[Ahmed Shawki (socialist)|Ahmed Shawki]], a leading member of the ISO, was invited in 2010 to speak at the SWP's Marxism festival while SWP National Secretary Martin Smith spoke at the ISO's Socialism 2010 conference. [[Alex Callinicos]], leading member of the SWP, also spoke at the Socialism 2012 conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialismconference.org/speakers&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO also maintains friendly relations with the [[Fourth International]], currently holding permanent observer status in the FI.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Publications==

The ISO publishes a daily online and monthly print newspaper, &quot;[[Socialist Worker]],&quot;  with a bi-monthly Spanish language supplement, ''Obrero Socialista.''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2008-1/663/663_05_NewEra.shtml &quot;A new era for ''Socialist Worker''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO also distributes the International Socialist Review and titles from the publishing house [[Haymarket Books]], both of which are run by the Center for Economic Research and Social Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsd.com/pubdetail.aspx?id=330 Consortium Book Sales &amp; Distribution | Publisher Information]. (accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The ISO participates in several local and national progressive movements. These include the antiwar movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campusantiwar.net/news/counter-recruitment/sf_state_students_hold_rally_counter_marine_recruiters.html &quot;SF State Students Hold Rally, Counter Marine Recruiters&quot;], October 26, 2006, Campus Antiwar Network website.(accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt; efforts to end the death penalty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/newab020/protest.html &quot;Protesting Bush's Execution Machine&quot;], ''The New Abolitionist'', Issue 20, July 2001.

The ISO does not support the Republican party or Democratic party, both of which it views as political representatives of corporate power. The group has, however, campaigned for the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] in various races and assisted [[Ralph Nader]]'s presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/600 &quot;The Green Party: offering a real challenge to business as usual, or just Capitalism Lite?&quot;], ''Freedom Socialist'', Volume 27, Issue 6, December 2006 - January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In California in 2006, ISO member [[Todd Chretien]] challenged [[Diane Feinstein]] for a seat in the United States [[United States Senator|Senate]] on the Green Party ticket, receiving 139,425 votes (1.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;California Secretary of State, [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/ssov/us_sen_sum.pdf Supplement to Statement of Vote - United States Senator - Statewide Summary&quot;], ''Statement of Vote, 2006 General Election'', at www.sos.ca.gov website.

(accessed 2008-06-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISO has participated in the [[Occupy movement]], starting with the &quot;general assemblies&quot; used to plan New York City's [[Occupy Wall Street]] and its Summer 2011 predecessor, &quot;Bloombergville&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Writers for the 99%. [http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/ows/ ''Occupy Wall Street'']. OR Press, 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singsen, Doug (2012). &quot;A balance sheet of Occupy Wall Street&quot;, ''International Socialist Review'', Issue 81, pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization views Occupy as having &quot;shown the potential to build a mass, activist left in the U.S. for the first time in decades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2011/11/22/occupys-next-struggle &quot;Occupy's next struggle&quot;], ''Socialist Worker'', November 22, 2011 (accessed 2012-2-12).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism conference==

The ISO is the co-sponsor, along with the Center for Economic Research and Social Change, of an annual conference entitled &quot;Socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialismconference.org/ SocialismConference.org website] (accessed 2011-06-27)&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers at past Socialism conferences include filmmaker and author [[Tariq Ali]], actor [[Wallace Shawn]], ''The Nation'' sportswriter [[Dave Zirin]], writer [[Glenn Greenwald]], journalist [[Amy Goodman]], environmental writer [[John Bellamy Foster]], ''The Nation'' contributor [[Jeremy Scahill]], Iraq Veterans Against the War member [[Camilo MejÃ­a]], and Palestinian rights activists [[Omar Barghouti]] and [[Ali Abunimah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2010/06/22/ideas-for-changing-the-world âIdeas for changing the worldâ], SocialistWorker.org, 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2008/06/24/socialism-offers-alternative âSocialism offers the alternativeâ], SocialistWorker.org, 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
