'''Virgil Hamlin Goode, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|g|uː|d}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=80598&amp;title=daily-show-mohammad,-mo-problems Daily Show, Jan 09, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; born October 17, 1946) is an [[United States|American]] politician who served as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1997 to 2009, first as a Democrat; in 2000 he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He represented the [[Virginia's 5th congressional district|5th congressional district]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/va05_109.gif map]&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his seat in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008 election]] to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Tom Perriello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Perriello declared winner in 5th District recount| newspaper = [[Charlottesville Daily Progress]] | url = http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/local_govtpolitics/article/perriello_declared_winner_in_5th_district_recount/32941/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goode subsequently joined the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] and was the party's 2012 presidential nominee.

== Early life and education ==

Goode was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the son of Alice Clara (née Besecker) and Virgil Hamlin Goode.&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/goode.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Goode graduated with a B.A. from the [[University of Richmond]] ([[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]) and with a J.D. from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]]. He also is a member of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity and served in the [[Army National Guard]] from 1969 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008/elections/va/house/846/virgil-h-goode-jr/ |title=Virgil H. Goode, Jr. &amp;#124; 2008 Elections for President, Congress and Governor &amp;#124; washingtonpost.com |publisher=Projects.washingtonpost.com |date=1946-10-17 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia Senate==
Goode grew up as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Delegate Hull's Richmond Report | author=Bob Hull, Virginia House of Delegates | date=28 December 2006 | url= http://www.fcnp.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&amp;Itemid=34| publisher= Falls Church News-Press}} Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He entered politics soon after graduating from law school. At the age of 27, he won a special election to the state Senate from a Southside district as an independent after the death of the Democratic incumbent. One of his major campaign focuses at the time was advocacy for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Goode Has Often Inspired Political Ire|publisher=Washington Post | date=December 23, 2006| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201351.html|author=Michael D. Shear And Tim Craig}} Retrieved on December 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after being elected, he joined the Democrats.

Goode wore his party ties very loosely. He became famous for his support of the tobacco industry, expressing his fear that &quot;his elderly mother would be denied 'the one last pleasure' of smoking a cigarette on her hospital deathbed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot;/&gt; He was an ardent defender of gun rights while being an enthusiastic supporter of [[L. Douglas Wilder]], who later became the first elected black governor in the history of the United States. At the Democratic Party's state political convention in 1985, Goode nominated Wilder for lieutenant governor. However, while governor, Wilder cracked down on the sale of guns in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot;/&gt;

After the 1995 elections resulted in a 20–20 split between Democrats and Republicans in the State Senate, Goode seriously considered voting with the Republicans on organizing the chamber. Had he done so, the State Senate would have been under Republican control for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] (the Republicans ultimately won control outright in 1999). Goode's actions at the time &quot;forced his party to share power with Republican lawmakers in the state legislature,&quot; which further upset the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot;/&gt;

==U.S. Senate elections==

===1982===
Independent incumbent U.S. Senator [[Harry Flood Byrd, Jr.]], decided to retire. Goode ran for the seat, but lost the nomination, getting just 8% of the vote. [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Richard Joseph Davis]] won the convention with 64% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=419685 |title=VA US Senate – D Convention Race – Jun 05, 1982 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis lost the general election by a two point margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcampaigns.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3776 |title=VA US Senate Race – Nov 02, 1982 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994===
{{See also|United States Senate election in Virginia, 1994}}
He decided to run for the U.S. Senate again in 1994, to challenge incumbent Democrat U.S. Senator [[Chuck Robb]] in the Democratic convention. He angered much of the leadership of the [[Democratic Party of Virginia|Virginia Democratic Party]] during his second run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot; /&gt; Robb won the convention 50%–22%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcampaigns.com&quot;/&gt; However, Robb failed to reach the threshold needed to avoid a primary election. On June 14, Robb defeated Goode 58%–34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=16076 |title=VA US Senate – D Primary Race – Jun 14, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
;1996
When incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Lewis F. Payne, Jr.|Lewis Payne]] decided to retire in 1996, Goode won the Democratic nomination to succeed him. His state senate district was virtually co-extensive with the southern portion of the congressional district. He defeated Republican nominee [[George Landrith]], an attorney, 61%–36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30091 |title=VA District 5 Race – Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1998
Goode won re-election to a second term unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31193 |title=VA District 5 Race – Nov 03, 1998 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2000
Prior to the election, Goode switched from a Democrat to an independent. He portrayed himself &quot;as independent as the people he serves.&quot; Despite running as an independent, he won re-election to a third term with 67% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=675 |title=VA District 5 Race – Nov 07, 2000 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2002
For the 2001 congressional redistricting, Goode allied with Republican [[Bob Goodlatte]] and Democrat [[Rick Boucher]] to ensure that none of them would be put in the same district. Goode's home in [[Franklin County, Virginia|Franklin County]] is only about 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) south of Goodlatte's home in [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]], the heart of the {{ushr|Virginia|6|6th district}}. The counties to the west of Franklin County are in Boucher's {{ushr|Virginia|9|9th District}}, which had to expand due to lack of population growth. 

He won the Republican nomination and won re-election to a fourth term with 63% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1255 |title=VA District 5 Race – Nov 05, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sbe.state.va.us/web_docs/election/results/2002/nov/c_06_005.htm General Election – November 5, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Republican to represent this district since 1889.

;2004
He won re-election to a fifth term with 64% of the vote, defeated Vietnam War veteran and businessman [[Al Weed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4392 |title=VA – District 05 Race – Nov 02, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth of Virginia – General Election 2004; Vote totals US House District 5| url= http://www2.sbe.virginia.gov/web_docs/Election/Results/2004/Nov2004/c_06_005.htm}} Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

;2006

He won re-election to a sixth term with 59% of the vote against Weed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207745 |title=VA – District 05 Race – Nov 07, 2006 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 5}}
In 2008 Goode lost his seat, being defeated by Democrat [[Tom Perriello]] by 727 votes (0.24% of over 316,000 votes cast).  While Goode won 13 of the district's 20 counties and independent cities, Perriello's margin of victory was decided in the district's more urbanized areas. Goode won only one independent city in the district, [[Bedford, Virginia|Bedford]], but by only 16 votes. Ultimately, Goode could not overcome a combined 19,000-vote deficit in the [[Charlottesville]] area (Charlottesville and surrounding [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]), where Perriello is from.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008 SBE unofficial&quot;&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Virginia State Board of Elections | title = November 2008 Unofficial Results | url = https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2008/07261AFC-9ED3-410F-B07D-84D014AB2C6B/Unofficial/6_s.shtml | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 5}}
Goode had filed paperwork with the [[Federal Election Committee]] to allow him to raise money for a possible rematch in the 2010 elections, due to receiving &quot;unsolicited&quot; campaign contributions, though he said he had not decided whether or not he would run in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/former-rep.-goode-files-to-run-for-old-seat-2009-03-12.html|title=Former Rep. Goode files to run for old seat|author=Aaron Blake|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Goode announced in late July 2009 that he would not seek the Republican nomination for the seat in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/article.cfm?ID=19876&amp;back=archives|title=Goode's Service Praised|author=Mickey Powell|work=[[Martinsville Bulletin (newspaper)|Martinsville Bulletin]]|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many expected this race to be heavily targeted by the Republican Party in 2010; and it was won by Republican [[Robert Hurt (Virginia politician)|Robert Hurt]] that year.

===Tenure===
During his first two terms, he compiled one of the most conservative records of any Democrat in the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voteview.com/c105/c105.htm Voteview analysis of the 105th Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; Like many [[Southern Democrat]]s, Goode strongly opposed [[abortion]] and [[gun politics in the United States|gun control]] and vigorously supported the [[tobacco]] industry. His contrarian streak resulted in him being isolated within the Democratic caucus, which later led to him switching parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;/&gt;

Goode came under considerable fire shortly after being unopposed for a second term in 1998, when he voted for three of the four articles of [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] against [[Bill Clinton]]. In January 2000, he declared himself an independent and began caucusing with the Republicans, who gave him a seat on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]]. Republicans had been lobbying him to switch parties since 1998. Reflecting on Goode's record at the time, [[David E. Brown (elected official)|David Brown]], the [[List of mayors of Charlottesville, Virginia|mayor]] of [[Charlottesville]] and a former chairman of the city's Democratic Party said &quot;It was obvious he didn't really fit in the Democratic Party anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear&amp;Craig&quot;/&gt;

Goode's primary policy initiatives were opposition to amnesty for illegal aliens, veterans' healthcare, and the enactment in 2004 of a $9.6 billion buyout for tobacco farmers. Goode has sponsored legislation to permit deployment of the U.S. Armed Forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. He voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War and in support of an $87 billion [[Iraq War]] supplemental spending bill.

Goode is an advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]]. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Goode voted in 2007 against a resolution opposing the increase in troop numbers in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2007&amp;rollnumber=99 |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 99 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that he didn't want to &quot;aid and assist the [[jihad|Islamic jihad]]ists who want the green flag of the crescent and star to wave over the Capitol of the United States and over the [[White House]] of this country&quot; and that &quot;radical [[Muslim]]s&quot; wanted to control the world and put &quot;In [[Muhammad]] We Trust&quot; on American currency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2007_record&amp;page=H1706&amp;position=all Congressional Record.

;Liberty caucus
Goode served on the [[Republican Liberty Caucus|Liberty Caucus]] (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-leaning congressional representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Ron Paul]] hosts a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday. Other members include [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|Jimmy Duncan]] of [[Tennessee]], [[Walter B.

;MZM
In 2005, Goode faced questions when a major corporate campaign donor, defense contractor MZM, Inc., was implicated in a bribery scandal that resulted in the criminal conviction and resignation of California congressman [[Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goode's liability in scandal unclear|author=Peter Hardin| publisher=Times-Dispatch|date=February 26, 2006|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&amp;%09s=1045855935264&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1137834366359&amp;path=!news!politics }} Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although Goode insisted that his relations with MZM were motivated solely by his interest in bringing high-paying skilled jobs to his district, in December of that year he donated the $88,000 received in MZM contributions to regional charities.

On July 21, 2006 Richard Berglund, a former supervisor of the [[Martinsville, Virginia]] office of MZM Inc., pleaded guilty to making illegal donations to Goode's campaign. Court papers indicated that Berglund and MZM owner [[Mitchell Wade]] (who previously pleaded guilty) engaged in a scheme to reimburse MZM employees for campaign donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goode's war chest turns up new MZM donor|author=Lindsy Nair|date=July 4, 2006|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-72325 }} Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There was no allegation of wrongdoing on the part of Goode's campaign.

;2006 Qur'an controversy
{{Main|Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress}}

In 2006, [[Minnesota's 5th congressional district]] elected [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Keith Ellison]] as the first [[Muslim]] to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some criticized Ellison's intended use of the [[Qur'an]] once owned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] at a private swearing-in ceremony;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010300075.html | work=The Washington Post | title=But It's Thomas Jefferson's Koran! | first1=Amy | last1=Argetsinger | first2=Roxanne | last2=Roberts | date=January 3, 2007 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; among them, Goode was vocal in his opposition to Ellison's plan. One of Goode's constituents posted a letter online from the congressman regarding Ellison. The letter reads in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I raise my hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from [[Minnesota]] was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don't wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Koran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howsare&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Goode makes complete ass of self: Anti-Muslim letter goes out to hundreds – not all are amused| author=Erika Howsare|publisher=C-Ville Weekly |date=2006-12-19| url=http://www.c-ville.com/index.php?cat=141404064431134&amp;ShowArticle_ID=11041812060944420 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swarns&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressman Criticizes Election of Muslim| author=Rachel L.

Ellison criticized Goode for this letter, stating that he is not an immigrant and that Goode does not understand Islam.  Ellison also offered to meet with Goode to discuss the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swarns&quot;/&gt; On his first day in office, Ellison sought out Goode and initiated a cordial exchange on the House floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim congressman shakes critic's hand'|date=December 21, 2006 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/04/congress.muslim/index.html|publisher=CNN}} Retrieved on January 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

In interviews around that time, Goode stated that he was in favor of decreasing legal immigration to the United States and that he wanted to do away with [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]]s. Goode argued that such visas would allow people &quot;not from [[Europe]]an countries&quot; or from &quot;some terrorist states&quot; to enter America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellison: Lawmaker has 'a lot to learn about Islam'|date=December 21, 2006 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/21/quran.congress/index.html|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061222162935/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/21/quran.congress/index.html|archivedate=December 22, 2006|accessdate=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goode also repeated his views on a January 1, 2007 post to the ''[[USA Today]]'' [[blog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposing view: Save Judeo-Christian Values|date=January 1, 2007 |url= http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2007/01/opposing_view_s.html|publisher=USA Today | first=Thomas S. | last=Kidd}} Retrieved on January 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hummer accusation
At the 2008 [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] parade in [[Scottsville, Virginia]], independent supporters of Goode drove a [[Hummer H3]] decorated with signs promoting Goode and [[Robert B. Bell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cvillepodcast.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The real story of Virgil Goode and the Hummer|date=August 1, 2008|url=http://www.cvillepodcast.com/2008/08/01/the-real-story-of-virgil-goode-and-the-hummer/}} Retrieved on August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; With gas prices at $4 a gallon, a supporter of Goode's opponent, [[Tom Perriello]], put video of the parade on [[YouTube]], accusing Goode of being out of touch with ordinary citizens grappling with the high cost of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube: Virgil Goode Grief'|date=July 7, 2008 |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOi7iWwnYuI|publisher=YouTube}} Retrieved on Aug. 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Goode never rode in the Hummer, and is not known to have had anything to do with it, but he was widely portrayed as having both owned and operated the vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;cvillepodcast.com&quot;/&gt; He was lampooned on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' for the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily Show: Rappers or Republicans'|date=July 29, 2008 |url= http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=178008|publisher=Comedy Central}} Retrieved on August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunlight Foundation|The Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Goode has the 13th-highest amount of investment in oil stocks, meaning that Goode stands to gain financially through high gas prices and pro-oil industry legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog – Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Eden's Curve'' controversy
In the end credits of the [[gay]]-themed film ''Eden's Curve'', the producers list Goode in the acknowledgements. Linwood Duncan, Goode's press secretary, has a minor role as the dean of the college. A number of other Danville residents are listed in the cast and credits. 

The United States [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] grant that Goode assisted in bringing to the North Theatre project was received by the North Theatre organization in 2005. 

The ''Danville Register &amp; Bee'' reported that Duncan and Goode’s wife Lucy were both on the founding board of the North Theatre. Virgil Goode checked with the House ethics committee, before Duncan or his wife Lucy went onto the North Theatre board. In the light of the controversy, Lucy Goode stepped down from the board.

In 2003, Duncan told the ''Register &amp; Bee'' he didn’t see any conflict with the [[Earmark (finance)|earmarked]] dollars. &quot;I don’t even know how a question of a conflict even arises,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godanriver.com/gdr/news/local/danville_news/article/goode_linked_to_gay_movie/6829/ |title=Goode linked to movie about homosexuality |publisher=GoDanRiver.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sabato earmark controversy
In June 2009, it was revealed that political scientist [[Larry Sabato]], of the [[University of Virginia Center for Politics|Center for Politics]], had been the recipient of over $7 million in earmark money from Goode, whom Sabato predicted would win re-election in 2008, despite declining poll numbers; Goode ultimately lost the race by a small margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;earmarks&quot;&gt;[http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F5EA641B-18FE-70B2-A8CA7099244C65DC Ben Smith, ''Sabato's program earmark dries up'', The Politico, June 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some observers have suggested that Sabato should have revealed his financial connection to Goode or recused himself from making predictions about the race.&lt;ref name = &quot;criticism&quot;&gt;[http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/pundits/larry-sabato-and-the-dc-pundit-industrial-complex/   Greg Sargent, ''Larry Sabato And The D.C.
