The '''University of Essex''' is a British [[campus university]] whose original and largest campus is near the town of [[Colchester]], [[England]]. It was established in 1963, received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1965 and is now one of the UK's leading academic institutions with top-quality research, teaching and an international reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;QS Top Universities Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-essex|title=Essex University – QS Top Universities|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University is a member of the [[1994 Group]]. It has 18 main teaching departments and 36 centres and institutes in subjects including biological sciences, computer science, acting, economics, business, health/human sciences, history, language and linguistics, mathematical sciences, human rights, law, literature, film studies, theatre studies, philosophy, art history, psychology, psychoanalytic studies, sociology and government. 

The university's main [[campus university|campus]] is located within [[Wivenhoe Park]] in the English county of [[Essex]], less than a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the town of [[Wivenhoe]] &amp; {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} from the town of [[Colchester]]. Apart from the Wivenhoe Park campus, there is a rapidly developing campus in [[Southend-on-Sea]] (Essex's largest town), and the [[East 15 Acting School]] is based in [[Loughton]]. The University's [[motto]], ''Thought the harder, heart the keener'', is adapted from the Anglo-Saxon poem ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]''.

The University exhibits diversity and a strongly international character with 132 countries represented in its student body. The latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) in 2008 ranked Essex ninth in the UK for the quality of its research with more than 90% of research recognised internationally for its quality, with 22% of research rated as 'world leading'.&lt;ref name=&quot;QS Top Universities Rankings&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex confirmed among research elite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=478|title=Essex confirmed among research elite|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university enjoys collaborative partnerships with a number of institutions across the eastern region. These are [[University Campus Suffolk]], [[Colchester Institute]], Kaplan Open Learning (KOL), [[South Essex College]] and [[Writtle College]].

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:University of Essex - Albert Sloman Library.png|right|thumb|Albert Sloman Library]]
In July 1959, [[Essex County Council]] accepted a proposal from [[Charles Leatherland, Baron Leatherland|Alderman Leatherland]] that a university be established in the county. A University Promotion Committee was formed chaired by [[Lord Lieutenant of Essex]], [[Sir John Ruggles-Brise]], which submitted a formal application to the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] requesting that a University of Essex should be established. Initial reports suggested that the Promotion Committee had recommended [[Hylands Park]] in [[Chelmsford]] as the site for the new University, however in May 1961, the foundation of the university was announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] with [[Wivenhoe]] as the preferred location and in December of the same year, Wivenhoe Park was acquired for the new university. In July 1962, Dr Albert Sloman, MA, DPhil, Gilmour Professor of Spanish and Dean of the Faculty of Arts, [[University of Liverpool]], was appointed as Vice-Chancellor and the Rt. Hon. R A (later Lord) Butler, CH, MP, was invited to be Chancellor, with Mr A Rowland-Jones appointed as Registrar.

The first Professors were appointed in May 1963: Alan Gibson in Physics, [[Peter Townsend (sociologist)|Peter Townsend]] in Sociology, [[Donald Davie]] in Literature, [[Richard Lipsey]] in Economics, Ian Proudman in Mathematics, [[Jean Blondel]] in Government, and John Bradley in Chemistry. With its first staff appointed, a development plan for the university was published and a £1million Appeal Fund was launched. Within six months the Appeal Fund had exceeded its £1million target with [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|The Queen Mother]] and [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] among contributors, while work began on clearing the site for building work. In Autumn 1963, red was chosen as the University colour and the first prospectus was prepared and work began on the first permanent buildings; the science block and boiler room next to Wivenhoe House. In January 1964, [[Hardy Amies]] designed the university's academic robes and temporary teaching huts had to be erected close to Wivenhoe House, while in March Sir John Ruggles-Brise was appointed the first Pro-Chancellor and Alderman Leatherland the first Treasurer of the University. Two months later the university's Armorial Bearings were published, with the motto &quot;Thought the harder, heart the keener&quot;.

===Expansion===
In October 1964, the first 122 students arrived with 28 teaching staff in three schools: Comparative Studies, Physical Sciences and Social Studies. Departments of [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]], Government, [[Sociology]], Literature, [[Mathematics]] and Economics open along with the Language Centre (later the Department of Language and [[Linguistics]]) and the Computing Centre (later the Department of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) with Denis Mesure elected as the first President of the Students' Council. Work started on the first residential tower, Rayleigh in December with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] approving the grant of Charter to take effect from 11 January 1965.

1965 brought 399 students enrolling for the start of the new academic year; the number of academic staff more than doubled to 61; and the first degrees, five MSc and five [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] degrees were awarded. The Physics building opened and the first six floors of Rayleigh tower were ready for occupation, while work began on the Albert Sloman Library. The first female lecturer was appointed: Dr [[Dorothy E. Smith]] in the Department of [[Sociology]]. In December, University Court met for the first time with around 500 members. Six months later, work started on the Lecture Theatre Building, plus the 'Topping out' of Keynes tower.

In October 1966, the Hexagon Restaurant and General Store opened, with the number of students reaching 750. Lord Butler was installed as Chancellor at a ceremony held in Colchester's Moot Hall in 1967 and the first [[Honorary Degrees]] were presented, the University's Mace was carried for the first time, while the first annual Degree Congregation saw 135 degrees conferred in July. At the start of the next academic year, the departments of Computer Science and Electronic Systems Engineering accepted their first students, the SSRC Data Bank (later renamed the UK Data Archive) was established and the Lecture Theatre Building and Library opened along with the first phase of the Social and Comparative Studies building, while work proceeded on Tawney and William Morris residential towers.

===The 1960s===
[[File:Essex Uni lake.jpg|thumb|One of the lakes]]
Essex University was at the forefront of 1960s student unrest. At a time of worldwide protest against the [[Vietnam War]], the student movement was taking off all over the world. In March 1968, a demonstration against a visit to the University by [[Enoch Powell]] received national publicity. Seven students were summoned to disciplinary hearings but student sit-ins prevented these hearings taking place.

On Tuesday, 7 May 1968, Dr Inch from [[Porton Down]] came to give a lecture at the university. In a carefully planned demonstration, an indictment was read out as Dr Inch attempted to speak, citing chemical and biological warfare activities at Porton Down. University authorities called in police with dogs, probably for the first time in an English university. Students outnumbered police and managed to prevent arrests.

On Friday, 10 May, three students, Pete Archard, Raphael Halberstadt and [[David Triesman]] (now Lord Triesman) were suspended and ordered off the campus. No evidence or charges were notified to the students, and no opportunity was given for the students to present their defence.

Wyvern reported that on Monday, 13 May, “Students picket all entrances to the University from early morning distributing leaflets calling all students and staff to meeting to discuss suspension of the three students. A huge meeting attended by nearly all the University population, voted overwhelmingly to refuse to participate in the University – in its place a Free University was declared ”.

===The 1970s and the 1980s===
Between the 1970s and the 1980s, the University added a health Centre, day nursery, printing centre, bookstore, exhibition gallery and expanded the current student residences. New student residences were also constructed. The departments of philosophy, school of law, human rights centre and the department of biological sciences were opened.

In the late 1970s, financial problems plagued the university and threatened its existence. During this later period of the 70s to the early 80s, the university began concentrating its teaching into large departments. Cooperation with local companies was forged, allowing the university to secure vital research contracts. Due to its growing international reputation, the university began to attract a sizable number of International Students.&lt;ref name=&quot;University History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22014#n4|title=Essex University – British History Online|accessdate=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Professor Martin Harris was appointed Vice-Chancellor, taking over from the founding Vice-Chancellor, Albert Sloman. Also, in this year, University of Essex alumnus [[Oscar Arias]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

===The 1990s===
[[File:Rab Butler Building, University of Essex.JPG|upright|thumb|The Rab Butler Building]]
The university entered the 1990s with the expansion of its facilities, adding new residential blocks to provide further living space for its student population between 1991 and 1992. The Rab Butler building was opened in 1991 as the headquarters for the [[British Household Panel Survey]].  By its 30th anniversary in 1993, the university had built itself up into 17 key departments, providing education and research opportunities for 5,500 students, and employing 1,300 staff and faculty. The university also contained 5 industrial units and housed the Economic and Social Research Council's Data Archive. Further expansion continued to take place after 1993, with the £5.5&amp;nbsp;million expansion scheme for the provision of 234 new apartments for 1,200 students in a new student village.&lt;ref name=&quot;University History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22014#n7|title=Essex University – British History Online|accessdate=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments===
On 25 November 2004, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty the Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the university as part of its 40th anniversary celebrations (1964–2004). Some of the longest running members of staff were invited to meet them at the presentation including the University's first student, John M. Dowden. Starting postgraduate research on fluid dynamics at the age of 23 in 1963, John later became a professor of mathematics and was the head of the University's Mathematics Department from 2001–2005. He retired in September 2008.

[[File:P1020316.JPG|thumb|left|University Square, Southend, student accommodation]]
The university is constantly expanding. The Network Centre building opened in May 2004 housing the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering and parts of the Department of Computer Science (who merged in 2007 to create Computer and Electronic Systems). The University Quays, a student accommodation complex housing 770 students, opened in September 2003. The [[Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall]], with a 1,000 seat capacity, opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=103 Lecture hall shortlisted for award], University of Essex, UK, 10 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=1812 Shining light in Essex: Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall], [http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/ World Architecture News], 10 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Southend]]&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; the £26m Gateway Building opened in 2007, a former church been converted to the Clifftown Town Centre providing East 15 students with studios and workshop spaces. University Square, a 560 bedroom development near to the Gateway building opened in September 2010. At Wivenhoe Park, the 'Social Science Research Centre' was completed in February 2007, housing the University's Institute of Social and Economic Research and the [[UK Data Archive]]. A new building for the School of Health and Human Sciences was opened in 2008, as was the 'Centre for Brain Science' housing part of the Psychology department. Work is currently underway on a multi-phase 'Knowledge Gateway' project on the Wivenhoe campus. In 2013 three major projects are due for completion on the Colchester campus: a new Student Centre and Library extension, a new Business School building and The Meadows, a new 540 bedroom student accommodation project. Also in 2013, a new building is due to be completed providing a new library and teaching facilities in Southend. 

Wivenhoe House, an 18th century manor house on Wivenhoe Park, closed in December 2009 and is due to reopen in 2012 as the Edge Hotel School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgehotelschool.ac.uk/ |title=Welcome to Edge Hotel School - Home |publisher=Edgehotelschool.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a four star country house hotel which will also be the UKs first working hotel school dedicated to the development of future leaders of the hotel and hospitality industry.

==Departments and Research Centres==
[[File:Psychology building, University of Essex, west side.jpg|thumb|The Psychology building]]
The university is organised into four faculties, comprising 18 schools and departments, spanning the Humanities, Law and Management, Social Sciences and Science and Engineering. In the last national Research Assessment Exercise the University of Essex was ranked ninth overall, with many schools and departments confirmed as amongst the best in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.essex.ac.uk/research/excellence/rae.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  

Its departments of [[Economics]], Government ([[Political Science]]) and [[Sociology]] are well-known and are among the best in Europe. Essex's research in politics, economics and sociology received top (5*) ratings in the UK government's 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://195.194.167.103/Results/byinst/H-0118.pdf|title = 2001 Research Assessment Exercise – Institution: H-0118 University of Essex|accessdate = 7 August 2007|year = 2001|format = PDF|publisher=Higher Education and Research Opportunities (HERO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sociology department is the only in the country to have been awarded the highest rating in all six of the national Research Assessment Exercises (RAE) that have been undertaken since 1986. In the RAE 2008, Essex has reconfirmed its position as the UK’s leading university in the social sciences with Politics and Sociology ranked in first position, and Economics in third position nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;QS Top Universities Rankings&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex confirmed among research elite&quot;/&gt; According to Times Higher-QS world ranking exercise, Essex ranks as the 44th best in the world in Sociology and belongs to the 51-100 best in the field of Politics and International Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012/subject-rankings/social-science/sociology?page=1|title = QS World University Rankings by subject 2012 - Social Sciences &amp; Management - Sociology – Institution: H-0118 University of Essex|accessdate = 11 Novembr 2012 |year = 2012|format = html |publisher= QS World University Rankings (HERO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012/subject-rankings/social-science/politics-international-studies?page=3|title = QS World University Rankings by subject 2012 - Social Sciences &amp; Management - Politics &amp; International Studies – Institution: H-0118 University of Essex|accessdate = 11 Novembr 2012 |year = 2012|format = html |publisher= QS World University Rankings (HERO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the RAE 2008, the Essex Business School was ranked second in the UK in the Accounting and Finance subject area, while [[History]] was also ranked in second place, [[Linguistics]] fourth, and [[Art History]] ninth in the UK. The results for History (second in the UK, 35 per cent of research rated ‘world-leading’) and [[Philosophy]] (11th in the UK, 20 per cent of research ‘world-leading’) come within months of both departments being ranked second in the UK for overall student satisfaction in the National Student Survey (NSS). Essex featured in the UK’s top ten in half of the 14 subject areas submitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex confirmed among research elite&quot;/&gt;

The Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) is a research centre for the analysis of panel data in Economics and Sociology. It opened in 1989 as the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change in Britain and now houses the ESRC-funded Understanding Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandingsociety.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Understanding Society |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, a longitudinal study of the socio-economic circumstances and attitudes of 100,000 individuals in 40,000 British households. 

In September 2000 the [[East 15 Acting School]] became part of the university. The school is based in [[Loughton]] in southwest Essex and has a branch in Southend.

The School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering was inaugurated on 1 August 2007. It was created by merging two long-established departments: The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering which both began in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/csee/department/ |title=School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering :: The School :: History |publisher=Essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has particular strengths in [[Robotics]], Telecommunications, [[Artificial Intelligence]] and Logic and Computation. In 1999 a robotic football team from the department came third in the RoboCup 99 - part of the [[Robot Wars (TV series)]]. Current notable academics in this school include [[Richard Bartle]], best known as co-creator of [[MUD1]],&lt;ref&gt;http://mud.co.uk/richard/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Tsang]] for his work on [[constraint satisfaction]] and [[computational finance]], Professor [[Ray Turner]] for his numerous publication relating to Logic and Computation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/turnr/ |title=Computer Science at the University of Essex: Ray Turner |publisher=Cswww.essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Vic Callaghan as head of the Intelligent Environments Group (IEG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iieg.essex.ac.uk/ |title=IEG @ UEssex |publisher=Iieg.essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Lucas for his research into [[Computational Intelligence]] and Computer Games namely for his research with the UK Research Network on Artificial Intelligence and Video Game technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aigamesnetwork.org/main:start |title=Artificial Intelligence and Games Research Network [AI and Games Research Network&amp;#93; |publisher=Aigamesnetwork.org |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Research Assessment Exercise 2008 the University of Essex scored well in Computer Science and Informatics achieving 50% for research at level 3 of the RAE scale and 40% at level 3 in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submission.aspx?id=23&amp;type=uoa&amp;subid=3300 |title=RAE 2008 : Submissions : Submission |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Photonics Hyperhighway project began in 2010 and is planned to run for six years. It was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) with an aims to focus on energy-efficient ultra high capacity ICT infrastructure. The project plans to make broadband internet 100 times faster including partnership with the BBC to help broadcast ultra high definition content.&lt;ref name=&quot;tavi-port.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavi-port.org/ |title=The Tavistock and Portman - Leaders in mental health care and education |publisher=Tavi-port.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.essex.ac.uk/ccfea Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents] (CCFEA) is an interdisciplinary centre. It applies [[computational intelligence]] techniques to [[computational finance]] and [[computational economics]]. Essex was the first UK university to offer [http://www.essex.ac.uk/ccfea/prospective_students/ProgrammeDescriptions/msccf.aspx Master degrees in Computational Finance].

The Institute of Democracy and Conflict Resolution (IDCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idcr.org.uk/ |title=The Institute for Democracy and Conflict Resolution: Home |publisher=Idcr.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is planning a new flagship building on the Knowledge Gateway part of the Colchester campus, having appointed world-renowned architect [[Daniel Libeskind]], an alumnus of the university.

==Partner institutions==
The university has strong regional agenda and a number of partner institutions in the region: Colchester Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colchester.ac.uk/ |title=Colchester Institute College &amp;#124; Education and Training Courses in Essex |publisher=Colchester.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Essex College&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southend.ac.uk/ |title=South Essex College |publisher=Southend.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in Southend), [[Writtle College]] (near Chelmsford),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Coe |url=http://www.writtle.ac.uk/Writtle |title=College |publisher=Writtle.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Tavistock and Portman Trust&lt;ref name=&quot;tavi-port.org&quot;/&gt; (in London) and [[University Campus Suffolk]], a joint venture with the [[University of East Anglia]], with a central campus in [[Ipswich]] and five centres in Suffolk and Norfolk.

==Reputation==

[[File:Teaching Centre interior, University of Essex.JPG|thumb|The Tony Rich Teaching Centre, opened in 2010]]
Essex is among the smallest multi-faculty universities in Britain and is a member of the [[1994 Group]]. Despite its small size, Essex has developed an international reputation for teaching and research. The annual Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis and Collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/methods/ |title=Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis and Collection |publisher=Essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; now approaching its 41st year, attracts faculty and students from all over the world as does the human rights centre&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.essex.ac.uk/human_rights_centre/&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating its 25th year.

The university was known as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] hotbed with respect to faculty and students, but today is characterized, as most UK campuses, by rather less radical student politics.

The University of Essex was rated ninth in the UK in the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE, 2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Essex confirmed among research elite&quot;/&gt; and was in the top 20 for student satisfaction, amongst mainstream English universities, following the National Student Survey (NSS, 2011).

The 2010 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Professor Christopher Pissarides who gained his BA and MA degrees in Economics at the university in the early 1970s. 

Despite a national trend, showing a drop in the number of applications to Higher Education institutions; applications to the University of Essex have increased by 46% in the last four years. Vice-Chancellor of the University of Essex, Professor Colin Riordan, said:

“This is an encouraging sign that students are recognising the value of an Essex degree.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentcashpoint.co.uk/News.aspx?WCI=htmResults&amp;WCU=CBC=View,SEARCH=FT%3dEssex,DSCODE=J4BGRL2,NEWSITEMID=240-N1018,UDATA= |title=Essex University Bucks the National Drop in Applications

A separate Subject Ranking of Political Science Departments by [[Simon Hix]] of the [[London School of Economics]] places the University's Government Department 2nd in UK and 17th worldwide, ahead of the University of Cambridge &amp; University of Oxford in the UK but behind the London School of Economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon Hix PolStudies Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/Hix-PolStudiesReview-2004.pdf|title= A Global Ranking of Political Science Departments – Simon Hix|accessdate= 2 August 2008|format= PDF|publisher=[[Simon Hix, LSE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an independent study published in the [[Journal of the European Economic Association]], economics in Essex is ranked 5th in UK, 12th in Europe, and 54th in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rankings in Economics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/154247603322752566/abstract|title= Rankings of Academic Journals and Institutions in Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wivenhoe Park campus==
[[File:Concrete blocks and fluffy things.jpg|thumb|left|Library and nearby buildings]]
The main campus, Wivenhoe Park, was once painted by famous landscape painter [[John Constable]]. With its concrete architecture, it is typical of England's 1960s universities. Wivenhoe Park houses the main 1960s buildings along with an 18th century house that also features in Constable's painting. [[Wivenhoe House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wivenhoehousehotel.co.uk/ |title=Wivenhoe House / Luxury Hotels Essex / Wedding Venues Essex / Corporate Event Venues |publisher=Wivenhoehousehotel.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was, until 2010, operated as a hotel and conference centre. It was closed in December 2010 for major refurbishment and will reopen in 2012 as a combined four-star country house hotel and hotel school.

There are 2 small lakes on campus (in the middle of one is the Vice-Chancellor's House).

The architect of the University of Essex campus took the Tuscan town of [[San Gimignano]] with its squares and towers as an inspiration (the university has six residential towers mainly for undergraduates, but the original plan was to build 29). As well as the towers, South Courts and the University Quays residences provide enough space to guarantee every first year a place on campus as well as all overseas students. Due to its particular form of architecture involving the use of prefabricated concrete and glass, the university is referred to as a [[Plate Glass University]].

The library has one of the few remaining still operating continuous loop [[paternoster lift]]s in the country.

==Student body==
The university has a very large population of international students, with over 4,235 international students in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;EssexFinance&quot;/&gt;  Nearly 50% of postgraduates, and 40% undergraduates are students whose country of origin is outside of the UK (including EU). The university boasts a large proportion of local students from state schools, and a third of its undergraduates are from working-class homes.

==Students' Union==
[[File:Students' Union, University of Essex, across Square 3.jpg|thumb|Students' Union across Square 3]]
The University of Essex Students' Union is well regarded nationally with awards including: officially recognised as a leading Students’ Union by the Students’ Union Evaluation Initiative, awarded Investors In People status as a good employer, winner of Sound Impact Environmental Award for ethical and environmental performance, Sub Zero was voted ‘Best Student Venue in the UK’ at the Smirnoff BEDA Awards. Some of the major music bands to play in Sub Zero include [[AC/DC]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[The Kinks]], [[Can (band)|Can]], [[King Crimson]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Radiohead]], [[The Smiths]] and [[The Specials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/facts_and_figures/ |title=University of Essex - About us - Facts and Figures |publisher=Essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Students' Union runs the majority of commercial services on campus. Its shops stock imported food products, reflecting the university's international community. It has licensed venues including the SU bar and club-style venues: Mondo, Level 2, and  Sub Zero (formerly the Underground and before that the Dancehall), which have hosted many bands and DJs. Sub Zero was voted best student union venue upon its refurbishment and is one of the biggest in the country, with a capacity of over 1,200. The Students' Union Bar underwent a £400,000 refurbishment in the summer of 2010.

The Students Union employs about 380 student staff and 50 permanent staff to work in its shops, venues, etc. The University of Essex Students Union was the first SU in the UK to receive the 'Investors in people Gold' award in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/wyvern/Archive/2010-01/news.htm |title=Wyvern : News : January 2010 |publisher=Essex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Students' Union underwent reform in 2007-8, in which the trustee and executive functions were separated, and greater voice was given to satellite campuses. The Executive Committee on the main Colchester campus is composed of seven full-time officers (the President and six vice-presidents) and six part-time officers. The Students' Union is a member of the National Union of Students.

==Sports==
The university has sports clubs, including for sports such as [[disc golf]] and American Football. Many of the university's Sports Clubs, known as the Essex Blades, achieve national success. In 2005–06, the Pool Team became the best in Britain winning the BUSA Championships defeating Cardiff in the final. In the 2007–08 season, the University of Essex Rugby Club won the BUSA Vase defeating Robert Gordon University 15–10 in the final as well as achieving promotion. The university's basketball and netball clubs reached BUSA finals in the 2007–08 season. In 2012 the male and female Handball Team won the [http://www.abuhc.com/the-awards.html UK Championship in Manchester]. The university has a sports centre, including a fitness suite, squash courts, netball and tennis courts and a 9 metre climbing wall used by the University of Essex Mountaineering Club. The university has a sailing clubhouse and boat-park at nearby [[Brightlingsea]].

Once a year, 'Derby Day' is a sports contest between the University of Essex clubs and the [[University of East Anglia]] sport teams. The event is hosted alternately by Essex and UEA.

==Recent buildings==
[[File:The Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall, from Library.jpg|thumb|The Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall]]
The [[Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall]], which opened in October 2006 and was designed by the architect [[Patel Taylor]], has attracted a mixed response, with Prince Charles reputedly referring to it as 'like a dustbin'.,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The building was named after Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] in April 2007, to mark his retirement from the position of [[vice chancellor]], a position he had held since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2007/nr20070403.htm|title = University honours Vice-Chancellor|accessdate = 29 February 2008|date =  3 April 2007|publisher=University of Essex [http://www.essex.ac.uk/comms/ Communications Office]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's 'Gateway' building in Southend was opened in January 2007, housing the academic activities including business, health and acting, as well as being home to programmes operated in collaboration with Queen Mary Dental School, a GP practice and a business incubation centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

New buildings have opened housing the departments of Psychology and Health and Human Sciences.

The Tony Rich Teaching Centre, built on the site of the former central boiler house, was officially opened on 6 October 2010.

==Links with industry==
Through the 1990s, and the influence of policy activity in the United States stimulated by the [[Bayh-Dole Act]], the British Government wanted to strengthen links between universities and industry. The University of Essex has received grants from the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) delivered by [[HEFCE]] and other government departments to develop such capacity. A Research and Enterprise Office has been established, which is to be complemented with the development of a research park adjacent to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;

| title = £50m research park plan unveiled – BBC News
| accessdate = 1 August 2008 | date=8 December 2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Links between the university and industry have mostly been found within the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE). CSEE has maintained a long standing relationship with the Japanese photography and printing company, [[Canon (company)|Canon]], as well as links with [[British Telecom]].

==Visual identity==
[[File:Essex Uni Logo.png|thumb|University of Essex logotype]]
The graphic identity, which includes the E logo formed from five squares, was created in 1996 by the British design consultancy, Lloyd Northover, founded by [[John Lloyd (graphic designer)]] and Jim Northover.
