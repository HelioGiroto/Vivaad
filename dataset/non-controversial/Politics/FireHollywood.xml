'''FireHollywood''', originally named '''Patriotic Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood''' (or '''PABAAH''') was a [[USA|U.S.]] [[nationalism|nationalist]]-[[Conservatism|conservative]] organization that called for the [[boycott]] of [[Hollywood]] [[films]] made by [[film maker]]s who have made statements deemed by the group to be &quot;[[Patriotism|unpatriotic]],&quot; &quot;[[anti-American]]&quot; or [[treason]]ous. Though it mainly targeted film makers, it targeted other pop-culture figures, including [[musician]]s.

PABAAH was formed by [[Jon Alvarez]] (born circa 1966, deceased 2011) in reaction to the &quot;[[Not in Our Name]]&quot; [[Internet]] [[petition]] against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which included many celebrity signatures. According to Alvarez, these celebrities were &quot;unpatriotic&quot; for making political stances against current [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], his [[foreign policy]] and otherwise &quot;[S]tepping out of their roles as entertainers.&quot;

FireHollywood has been criticized for this attitude â€”many who visit the site, including [[moderate]] conservatives, have accused the group of advocating [[censorship]]. Some within the group have advocated views in favor of certain limited kinds of censorship{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, but others argue that the main goal of the group is to deny liberal celebrities a living in the movie business, not the right to free speech. Regardless of its intentions, the group's boycotting techniques have been compared to [[McCarthyism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://64.233.161.104/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.themichigantimes.com%2Fmedia%2Fpaper620%2Fnews%2F2004%2F01%2F22%2FArtsEntertainment%2FHollywood.Has.A.Voice.Too-584713.shtml&amp;btnG=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its support for the war in Iraq, FireHollywood also supports other initiatives such as the [[repeal]] of the [[22nd Amendment]], which prohibits presidents from serving more than two terms. FireHollywood has also petitioned the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to try [[Michael Moore]] for [[treason]] against the United States. In tow with their nationalist leanings, some in  the group advocate [[racial profiling]] when it comes to the movement of Arab minorities in Western nations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

FireHollywood gained some national and international attention, being covered by some major news broadcasts, newspaper columnists and ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. In its PABAAH days, the group received attention in the indie press by pursuing college radio stations for playing music by the anti-Bush industrial group [[Skinny Puppy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgnews.com/media/storage/paper883/news/2004/12/12/LocalNews/Conservatives.Ban.College.Radio.Stations-1293680.shtml?norewrite200610261860&amp;sourcedomain=www.bgnews.com&lt;/ref&gt; PABAAH's actions, according to the vocalist from the band, actually increased record sales. PABAAH was best known on this level for its extensive and frequently-updated website list of those who have made statements that are considered by the group to be either anti-Bush or &quot;[[anti-American]]&quot;, including non-Americans like [[Canada|Canadians]] [[Neil Young]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], as well as [[United Kingdom|British]] musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].

Celebrities who support the Bush administration (or, presumably, those who have remained neutral on the subject) are posted on a similar list of &quot;Patriotic Entertainers&quot;, which also includes non-Americans like [[Canada|Canadian]] [[comedian]] [[Norm Macdonald]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[actor]] [[Gary Oldman]].

In 2005, founder Jon Alvarez, a native of [[Baldwinsville, New York]], left the group to join the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]].
