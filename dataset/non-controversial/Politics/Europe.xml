Yet the borders of Europe—a concept dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—are somewhat arbitrary, as the primarily [[physical geography|physiographic]] term &quot;continent&quot; can incorporate [[human geography|cultural and political]] elements.

Europe is the world's [[List of continents|second-smallest]] continent by surface area, covering about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}} or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 states, [[Russia]] is by far the largest by both area and population, taking up 40% of the continent (although the country has territory in both Europe and Asia), while the [[Vatican City]] is the smallest. Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa, with a [[Demographics of Europe|population]] of 733&amp;nbsp;million or about 11% of the [[World population|world's population]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3585_0_5_0 Global: UN Migrants, Population]&quot;.

Europe, in particular [[Ancient Greece]], is the birthplace of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It played a predominant role in global affairs from the 15th century onwards, especially after the beginning of [[colonialism]]. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times [[European colonisation of the Americas|the Americas]], [[Colonisation of Africa|most of Africa]], [[Oceania]], and large portions of Asia. Both [[World War]]s were largely focused upon Europe, greatly contributing to a decline in [[Western Europe]]an dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] took prominence.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 534&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the west and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the east. [[European integration]] led to the formation of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]] in Western Europe, both of which have been expanding eastward since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianized western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F.

Europe is now generally defined by geographers as the westernmost [[peninsula]] of Eurasia, with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the south-east, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007|title=Europe|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of sociopolitical and cultural differences, there are various descriptions of Europe's boundary. For example, [[Cyprus]] is approximate to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is usually considered part of Europe and currently is a member state of the EU. In addition, [[Malta]] was considered an island of North Africa for centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

==Etymology==
[[File:Europa copy.jpg|thumb|Europa and the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] on a Greek vase. Tarquinia Museum, circa 480 BC]]
In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess whom [[Zeus]] abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of [[Crete]] where she gave birth to [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and [[Sarpedon]]. For [[Homer]], Europe ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}''; see also [[List of Greek place names]]) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation. Later, ''Europa'' stood for [[Geography of Greece|central-north Greece]], and by 500 BC its meaning had been extended to the lands to the north.

The name of ''Europa'' is of uncertain etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Minor theories, such as the (probably folk-etymological) one deriving Europa from εὐρώς (''gen''.: εὐρῶτος) &quot;mould&quot; aren't discussed in the section&lt;/ref&gt; One theory suggests that it is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] εὐρύς (''eurus''), meaning &quot;wide, broad&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ/ὠπ-/ὀπτ- (''ōps''/''ōp''-/''opt-''), meaning &quot;eye, face, countenance&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; hence ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}'', &quot;wide-gazing&quot;, &quot;broad of aspect&quot; (compare with [[Athena#Cult and attributes|''glauk'''ōp'''is'' (γλαυκῶπις 'grey-eyed') Athena]] or [[Hera|''bo'''ōp'''is'' (βοὠπις 'ox-eyed') Hera]]). ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of [[Earth]] itself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M. L.

[[wikt:Occident|Occident]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymonline: European&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=European| title=Etymonline: European| accessdate=10 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognate]] to Phoenician '' 'ereb'' &quot;evening; west&quot; and Arabic [[Maghreb]], Hebrew ''ma'ariv'' (see also ''[[Erebus]]'', [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;regʷos'', &quot;darkness&quot;). However, M. L. West states that &quot;phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M. L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=451 |isbn=0-19-815221-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major world languages use words derived from &quot;Europa&quot; to refer to the &quot;continent&quot; (peninsula). Chinese, for example, uses the word ''{{Unicode|Ōuzhōu}}'' (歐洲); this term is also used by the European Union in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-language diplomatic relations, despite the [[katakana]] ''{{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}}'' being more commonly used. However, in some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' (land of the [[Franks]]) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;davison&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]]. It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]). Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterized not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as [[causewayed enclosure]]s, [[burial mound]]s and [[megalithic tomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first=Chris|last=Scarre|authorlink=Chris Scarre|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|first-editor=Brian M.|last-editor= Fagan|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year=1996|pages=215–216|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|isbn=0-19-507618-4|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: authorlink=Brian Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corded Ware]] cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the [[Chalcolithic]].

The [[European Iron Age]] began around 800 BC, with the [[Hallstatt culture]]. Iron Age colonisation by the [[Phoenicians]] gave rise to early [[mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] cities. Early [[Iron Age Italy]] and [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity.

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the &quot;[[Age of Migrations]]&quot;. There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[European Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later still, the [[Vikings]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name = &quot;mieawl&quot;/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 143&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 162&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed &quot;[[Holy Roman Emperor]]&quot; by the Pope in 800. This led to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 166&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominantly [[medieval Greek|Greek speaking]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]] became known in the west as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Its capital was [[Constantinople]]. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]], funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 135&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Fatally weakened by the sack of Constantinople during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantines fell in 1453 when they were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 211&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic growth of Europe around the year 1000, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In this context, the growing independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 158&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 186&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 158&quot;/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. A [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 192&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Muslim presence in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 199&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [[Florence]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. in the 14th century. The rise of a [[Renaissance humanism|new humanism]] was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and Arabic knowledge from [[Monasticism|monastic]] libraries, often re-translanted from Arabic into [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Weiss|Weiss, Roberto]] (1969) ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', ISBN 1-59740-150-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jacob Burckhardt]]|origyear=1878|url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html|title=The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=translation by S.G.C Middlemore|year=1990|isbn=0-14-044534-X|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [[Renaissance art|art]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], and the [[History of science in the Renaissance|sciences]], under the joint patronage of [[Royal family|royalty]], the nobility, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and an emerging merchant class.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 254&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', ISBN 0-395-88947-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons in Italy, including the [[Medici]] family of Florentine bankers and the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], funded prolific [[quattrocento]] and [[cinquecento]] artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 292&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=High Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 193&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked [[The Ninety-Five Theses|by the works of]] German theologian [[Martin Luther]], a result of the lack of reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Empire's power, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 256&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics].

Partly as a result of its defeat Russia was plunged into the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], which threw down the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist monarchy]] and replaced it with the [[communist]] [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 480&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The [[Treaty of Versailles]], which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 443&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [[Fascism|fascist movements]] developed throughout Europe placing [[Adolf Hitler]] of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Francisco Franco]] of Spain and [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy in power.&lt;ref name=hobsbawn&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|publisher=Vintage|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-73005-7|title=The Age of Extremes: A history of the world, 1914–1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 438&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]], Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

[[File:Hamburg after the 1943 bombing.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Burned-out buildings in [[Hamburg]], 1944 or 45.]]
Shortly afterwards, Poland and Hungary started to press for the annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia with Polish and Hungarian majorities. Hitler encouraged the Slovaks to do the same and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]], while other smaller regions went to Poland and Hungary. With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of [[Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 465&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A.J.P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=0-684-82947-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter.

On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Nevertheless, the Germans knew of Britain's plans and got to Narvik first, repulsing the attack. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark, which left no room for a front except for where the last war had been fought or by landing at sea. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. However, the British refused to negotiate peace terms with the Germans and the war continued. By August Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 510&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the ultimately unsuccessful [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 532&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 532.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 511&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 519&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] landings, opening a new front against Germany. [[Berlin]] finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe.

[[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Schuman Declaration]] led to the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. It began the [[European integration|integration process]] of the [[European Union]]. ([[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950, at the [[French Foreign Ministry]])]]
World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the [[communist]] Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an &quot;[[iron curtain]]&quot;. The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 530&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 534&quot;/&gt;
In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name=hobsbawn/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 536&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 537&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 and 2007, more Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 27 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo 535&quot;&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|right|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]
Europe is a peninsula that makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt; Its maritime borders are made up of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Europe}}
[[File:Vegetation Europe.png|frame|[[Biome]]s of Europe and surrounding regions:
&lt;br /&gt;

]]

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]].

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name=climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate|title=European Climate|work=World Book|accessdate=16 June 2008|publisher=World Book, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed &quot;Europe's central heating&quot;, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&amp;nbsp;°C (60.8&amp;nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&amp;nbsp;°C (53.6&amp;nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8&amp;nbsp;°C (15&amp;nbsp;°F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22&amp;nbsp;°C (40&amp;nbsp;°F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name=climate/&gt;

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe}}
The Geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the &quot;main continent&quot;, while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

====Geological history====
{{Main|Geological history of Europe}}
The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo-Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055|title=Europe|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2007|accessdate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{See also|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|300px|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]
Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

Probably 80 to 90 per cent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf|title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe|publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal|page=182|accessdate=9 June 2008|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|left|300px|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]
In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

Glaciation during the most recent [[ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bears]] ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

{{See also|International organizations in Europe}}
European integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of states wholly or partially in Europe. In the present day, European integration has primarily come about through the Council of Europe and European Union in Western and Central Europe and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in Eastern Europe and most of former Soviet countries.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Europe}}
As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aL5a46f2RjVA |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world’s wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] economies are still emerging from the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

[[File:Europe gdp map-1-.png|thumb|left|European and bordering nations by [[GDP]] (nominal) per capita in 2006]]
The European Union, an intergovernmental body composed of 27 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 16 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the worlds largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=[[The CIA World Factbook]] – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is Moldova with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

===Pre–1945: Industrial growth===
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

===1945–1990: The Cold War===
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-19540-3|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[USSR]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name=loc-cs&gt;&quot;Germany (East)&quot;, Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/marshallplan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

===1991–2007: Integration and reunification===
With the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.
[[File:Unemployment European Union 2010M09.svg|thumb|right|Unemployment in the [[European Union]] in 2010, according to [[Eurostat]].]]
By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden.

Today, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). Australia and New Zealand have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]), some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Israel]]. Additionally, [[Transcontinental country|transcontinental]] and geographically Asian countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]] have populations historically closely related to Europeans, with considerable genetic and cultural affinity.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}
[[File:Rectified Languages of Europe map.png|thumb|Map of major European languages]]

European languages mostly fall within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Central or Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]]. Slavic languages are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Many other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic language|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. In addition, a distinct group of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Hungary]], while [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]), are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]]. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to the [[Languages of Russia|languages of minority nations]] in Russia.

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognized political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Europe}}
[[File:Ramsau (ja).jpg|thumb|St. Sebastian in [[Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden|Ramsau]], Germany]]
[[history of religion|Historically]], religion in Europe has been a major influence on [[Western art history|European art]], [[culture of Europe|culture]], [[Western philosophy|philosophy]] and [[European Union law|law]]. The largest religion in Europe is [[Christianity]], with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves [[Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-europe.aspx Christianity in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; including Catholic, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches. Following these is [[Islam]] concentrated mainly in the south east ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[TRNC|North Cyprus]], [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]]). Other religions, including Judaism, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's [[Republic of Kalmykia]]). The 20th century saw the revival of [[Neopaganism]] through movements such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druidry]].

Europe has become a relatively [[secular]] continent, with an increasing number and proportion of [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[atheism|atheist]] and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] people, actually the largest in the [[Western religion|Western world]]. There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], Sweden, Germany (East), and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|year=1998|title=The Decline of Traditional Values in Western Europe|journal=International Journal of Comparative Sociology|publisher=Sage|volume=39|pages=77–90|doi=10.1177/002071529803900106|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
The culture of Europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. There are cultural [[innovation]]s and movements, sometimes at odds with each other. Thus the question of &quot;common culture&quot; or &quot;common values&quot; is complex.

The foundation of European culture was laid by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], strengthened by the [[Culture of ancient Rome|Romans]], stabilised by [[Christianity]], reformed by the 15th-century [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], modernised by the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] and globalised by successive European empires between the 16th and 20th centuries.
{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

According to historian [[Hilaire Belloc]], for several centuries the peoples of Europe based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] and on concept of [[Christendom]], because many European-wide military alliances were of religious nature: the [[Crusades]] (1095–1291), the [[Reconquista]] (711-1492), the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie Belloc, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;
