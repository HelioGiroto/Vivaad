Originally a teacher at the ancient [[Taxila|Takshashila University]], Chanakya managed the first [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]'s rise to power at a young age. He is widely credited for having played an important role in the establishment of the Maurya Empire, which was the first empire in archaeologically recorded history to rule most of the Indian subcontinent. Chanakya served as the chief advisor to both Chandragupta and his son [[Bindusara]].

Chanakya is traditionally identified as '''Kautilya''' or '''Vishnu Gupta''', who authored the ancient Indian political treatise called [[Arthaśāstra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mabbett | first1 = I.

== Origin ==

=== Sources of information ===

There is little purely historical information about Chanakya: most of it comes from semi-legendary accounts. [[Thomas R. Trautmann]] identifies four distinct accounts of the ancient Chankya-Chandragupta ''katha'' (legend):&lt;ref name=&quot;Namita2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Namita Sanjay Sugandhi | title=Between the Patterns of History: Rethinking Mauryan Imperial Interaction in the Southern Deccan | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bdULPF4gNYC&amp;pg=PA88 | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year=2008 | publisher=ProQuest | isbn=978-0-549-74441-2 | pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following elements are common to these legends:
* The King [[Dhana Nanda]] insults Chanakya, prompting Chanakya to swear revenge and destroy the [[Nanda Empire]].
* Chanakya searches for one worthy successor to the Nanda and finds the young Chandragupta Maurya.
* With the help of some allies, Chanakya and Chandragupta bring down the Nanda empire, often using manipulative and secretive means.

=== Birth ===

Chanakya's birthplace is a matter of controversy, and there are multiple theories about his origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;VKSubramanian1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=V. K. Subramanian | title=Maxims of Chanakya: Kautilya | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HILzeFz0394C&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year= 1980 | publisher=Abhinav Publications | isbn=978-0-8364-0616-0 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory, he was born in Pataliputra or a town near it, Kusumpur. According to the Buddhist text ''Mahavamsa Tika'', his birthplace was [[Takshasila|Taxila]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SubodhKapoorEncyclo&quot;&gt;''[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=72BjBPBRb6MC&amp;pg=PA1372&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chanakya%20adbidhana%20kerala%20&amp;f=false The Indian Encyclopaedia]'' by Subodh Kapoor (2002). Cosmo Publications. Page 1372. ISBN 978-81-7755-257-7. Retrieved 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain scriptures, such as ''Adbidhana Chintamani'', mention him as a ''Dramila'', implying that he was a native of [[South India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SubodhKapoorEncyclo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of the Tamils from the Earliest Times to the Present Day| last= Iyengar| first= P. T. Srinivasa | authorlink= P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar|coauthors=| year=1929| publisher= | location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some other Jaina accounts, Chanakya was born in the village of Canaka to Caṇin and Caṇeśvarī, a Brahmin couple. Other sources mention his father's name as Chanak and state that Chanakaya's name derives from his father's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Trautmann | first = Thomas R. | authorlink = Thomas Trautmann | title = Kautilya and the Arthaśhāstra: A Statistical Investigation of the Authorship and Evolution of the Text | year = 1971 | publisher = E.J. Brill | location = Leiden | pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identitification with Kautilya or Vishnugupta ===

The ancient treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]'' has been traditionally attributed to Chanakya by a number of scholars. The ''Arthaśhāstra'' identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except for one verse that refers to him by the name Vishnugupta.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:5 &quot;the very last verse of the work...is the unique instance of the personal name Vishnugupta rather than the ''gotra'' name Kautilya in the ''Arthaśhāstra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kautilya is presumably the name of the author's [[gotra]] (clan).&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:10 &quot;while in his character as author of an ''Arthaśhāstra'' he is generally referred to by his ''[[gotra]]'' name, Kautilya.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest [[Sanskrit literature]]s to identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta explicitly was [[Vishnu Sharma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'' in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Mabbett 1964: &quot;References to the work in other Sanskrit literature attribute it variously to Vishnugupta, Chanakya and Kautilya. The same individual is meant in each case. The Panchatantra'' explicitly identifies Chanakya with Vishnugupta.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C. Ojha puts forward the view that the traditional identification of Vishnugupta with Kautilya was caused by a confusion of the text's editor and its originator. He suggests that Vishnugupta was a redactor of the original work of Kautilya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot;/&gt; Thomas Burrow goes even further and suggests that Chanakya and Kautilya may have been two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:67 'T. Burrow (&quot;{{IAST|Cāṇakya}} and {{IAST|Kauṭalya}}&quot;, ''Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 48–49'' 1968, p. 17 ff.) has now shown that {{IAST|Cāṇakya}} is also a ''[[gotra]]'' name, which in conjunction with other evidence makes it clear that we are dealing with two distinct persons, the minister {{IAST|Cāṇakya}} of legend and {{IAST|Kauṭilya}} the compiler of the ''Arthaśāstra''. Furthermore, this throws the balance of evidence in favor of the view that the second name was originally spelt ''{{IAST|Kauṭalya}},'' and that after the compiler of the ''Arth'' came to be identified with the Mauryan minister, it was altered to Kautilya (as it appears in Āryaśūra, Viśākhadatta and Bāna) for the sake of the pun. We must then assume that the later spelling subsequently replaced the earlier in the ''[[gotra]]'' lists and elsewhere.'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Chanakya was educated at [[Taxila|Takshashila]], an ancient center of learning located in north-western ancient India (present-day Pakistan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduism.co.za/chanakya.htm Chanakya-Niti]&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a teacher (''acharya'') at the same place.  Chanakya's life was connected to two cities: Takshashila and [[Pataliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in Bihar, India). Pataliputra was the capital of the [[Magadha]] kingdom, which was connected to Takshashila by [[uttarapatha|the northern high road of commerce]].

== Role in the fall of the Nanda empire ==
[[File:Nanda Empire.gif|thumb|right|The Nanda Empire at its greatest extent under [[Dhana Nanda]], circa 323 BC]]
[[File:Chandragupta Empire 320 BC.gif|thumb|right|Chandragupta's empire in its early years]]
Chankaya and Chandragupta have been credited with defeating the powerful Nanda Empire and establishing the new Maurya Empire.

''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' (&quot;The Signet of the Minister&quot;), a play dated variously from the late 4th century to the early 8th century, narrates the ascent of Chandragupta Maurya to power: Sakatala, an unhappy royal minister, introduced Chanakya to the Nanda king, knowing that Chanakya would not be treated well in the court. Insulted at the court, Chanakya untied the [[sikha]] (lock of hair) and swore that he would not tie it back till he destroyed the Nanda kingdom. According to ''Mudrarakshasa'', Chandragupta was the son of a royal concubine named Mura and spent his childhood in the Nanda palace. Chanakya and Chandragupta signed a pact with Parvataka (identified with [[King Porus]] by some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Manohar2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Manohar Laxman Varadpande | title=History Of Indian Theatre | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fOZB7MbeMrAC&amp;pg=PA229 | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year=2005 | publisher=Abhinav Publications | isbn=978-81-7017-430-1 | pages=227–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of north-west India that ensured his victory over the Nanda empire. Their combined army had [[Saka|Shaka]], [[Yona|Yavana]] (Greek), [[Kirata]], [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] and Vahlik soldiers. Following their victory, the territories of the Nanda empire were divided between Parvataka and Chanakya's associate Chandragupta. However, after Parvataka's death, his son [[Malayaketu]] sought control of all the former Nanda territories. He was supported by Rakshasaa, the former Nanda minister, several of whose attempts to kill Chandragupta were foiled by Chanakya. As part of their game plan, Chanakya and Chandragupta faked a rift between themselves. As a sham, Chandragupta removed Chanakya from his ministerial post, while declaring that Rakshasa is better than him. Chanakya's agents in Malayaketu's court then turned the king against Rakshasa by suggesting that Rakshasa was poised to replace Chanakya in Chandragupta's court. The activities by Chanakya's spies further widened the rift between Malayaketu and Rakshasa. His agents also fooled Malayaketu into believing that  five of his allies were planning to join Chandragupta, prompting Malayaketu to order their killings. In the end, Rakshasa ends up joining Chandragupta's side, and Malayaketu's coaliation is completely undone by Chanakya's strategy.

According to the Buddhist texts, Chandragupta was the son of the chief of the Moriya clan of Pippalivana. Chanakya once saw him leading a band of local youth and was highly impressed. He picked Chandragupta as the leader of the anti-Nanda revolt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manohar2005&quot;/&gt;

Several modern adaptions of the legend narrate the story of Chanakya in a semi-fictional form, extending these legends. In ''[[Chandragupta (play)|Chandragupta]]'' (1911), a play by [[Dwijendralal Ray]], the Nanda king exiles his half-brother Chandragupta, who joins the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. Later, with help from Chanakya and Katyayan (the former Prime Minister of Magadha), Chandragupta defeats Nanda, who is put to death by Chanakya.&lt;ref name = sourcessukumar&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ray |first1= Dwijendralal |editor1-first=Sukumar |editor1-last=Bandyopadhyay |title= Dwijendralaler Chandragupta|trans_title= Chandragupta by Dwindralal |edition=4th |year=2006-07  |origyear= 1969 |publisher=Modern Book Agency Pvt Ltd |location= [[Kolkata]]|language= [[Bengali language|Bengali]] |pages= Preface-10–14 |trans_chapter=Preface: Historic References |chapter=Bhumika: Aitihasikata }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-first-century works such as ''Chanakya'' (2001) by B. K. Chaturvedi&lt;ref name=&quot;BKChaturvedi2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=B. K. Chaturvedi | title=Chanakya | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ArAaNTn7FwIC | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year=2001 | publisher=Diamond Pocket Books | isbn=978-81-7182-143-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Chanakya's Chant]]'' (2010) by [[Ashwin Sanghi]] also present semi-fictional narratives of Chanakya's life. According to these, Chanakya's father Chanak was a friend of Shaktar, the Prime Minister of the Magadha kingdom, and Chanakya loved Shaktar's daughter Suvashini. Shaktar had lost much of his political clout to another courtier called Rakshasa, and one night, Shaktar was imprisoned by the King Dhana Nanda. The rivalry of the Chanakya's family with King Dhana Nanda started when Chanak openly criticized the misrule of the king. After the execution of Chanak by the King, the former Magadha minister Katyayan sent Chanakya to Acharya Pundarikaksha of Takshashila. Chanakya completed his education at Takshashila and became a teacher there. After some years, he returned to Pataliputra to meet his mother, only to learn that she was dead. He also learnt that the Nanda administration had further deteriorated under the growing influence of Rakshasa, who had made Suvashini his mistress. When Chanakya visited the royal court to advise him, he was insulted and imprisoned by the king. Chanakya was rescued by the men of General Maurya, another person who despised with the king's rule. Chanakya took Chandragupta Maurya to Takshashila, where he trained the young man. [[Taxiles|King Ambhi]], the ruler of Takshashila, had allied with the invader [[Alexander the Great]] to defeat Parvataka. Chanakya and Chandragupta gathered a band of people discontented with Ambhi's rule and formed an alliance with Parvataka to defeat the Nanda king. Their initial attempts at conquering Magadha were unsuccessful. Once, Chanakya came across a mother scolding her child for burning himself by eating from the middle of a bowl of porridge rather than the cooler edge. Chanakya realized his initial strategic error: he was attacking Magadha, the center of the Nanda territory. He then changed his strategy and focused on capturing the areas located at the peripharies of the Nanda empire. With help from Suvashini, he drove a wedge between the king and Rakshasa. Finally, he defeated the last Nanda king and established a new empire with Chandragupta Maurya as the emperor.

== After the establishment of the Maurya Empire ==
[[Image:MauryanCoin.JPG|thumb|259px|Silver punch mark coin of the [[Maurya Empire]], with symbols of wheel and elephant, 3rd century BCE]]

Chanakya continued to serve as an advisor to Chandragupta after the establishment of the Maurya Empire. According to a popular legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chanakya used to add small doses of poison to the food eaten by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya in order to make him immune to the poisoning attempts by the enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dīpavaṃsa and Mahāvaṃsa and their historical development in Ceylon | author = Wilhelm Geiger | translator = Ethel M.

The queen, not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes. In order to save the heir to the throne, Chanakya cut the queen's belly open and extracted the foetus just as she died. The baby was named [[Bindusara]], because he was touched by a drop (''bindu'') of blood having poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History of classical Sanskrit literature | author = M.

M. Joseph. International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 1997. ISBN 978-81-85692-23-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bindusara was in his youth, Chandragupta gave up the throne and followed the [[Jain]] saint [[Bhadrabahu]] to present day [[Karnataka]] and settled in the place of [[Shravana Belagola]]. He lived as an ascetic for some years and died of voluntary starvation according to Jain tradition. Chanakya meanwhile stayed in the court as an advisor to Bindusara.

== Death ==

The real cause of Chanakya's death is unknown and disputed. According to a legend, Subandhu, one of Bindusara's ministers, did not like Chanakya. One day he told Bindusara that Chanakya was responsible for the murder of his mother. Bindusara asked the nurses, who confirmed the story of his birth. Bindusara was horrified and enraged. Chanakya, who was an old man by this time, learnt that the King was angry with him, he decided to end his life. In accordance with the Jain tradition, he decided to starve himself to death. By this time, the King learnt the full story: Chanakya was not directly responsible for his mother's death, which was an accident. He asked Subandhu to convince Chanakya to give up his plan to kill himself. However, Subandhu, pretending to conduct a ceremony for Chanakya, burnt Chanakya alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vittachi2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Nury Vittachi | title=The Kama Sutra Of Business: Management Principles From Indian Classics | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uI0ALSCLb24C&amp;pg=PT87 | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year = 2007 | publisher=Wiley India Pvt. Limited | isbn=978-81-265-1454-0 | pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

Two books are attributed to Chanakya: ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and ''Neetishastra'' (also known as ''Chanakya Niti'').

The ''Arthashastra'' discusses [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] policies, [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[international relations]], and [[military strategy|war strategies]] in detail. The text also outlines the duties of a ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Halsall. Indian History Sourcebook: Kautilya: from the Arthashastra c. 250 BCE [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-1.3.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that ''Arthashastra'' is actually a compilation of a number of earlier texts written by various authors, and Chanakya might have been ''one'' of these authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namita2008&quot;/&gt;

''Neetishastra'' is a treatise on the ideal way of life, and shows Chanakya's deep study of the [[Culture of India|Indian way of life]]. Chanakya also developed ''Neeti-Sutras'' (aphorisms - pithy sentences) that tell people how they should behave. Of these well-known 455 sutras, about 216 refer to ''raja-neeti'' (the dos and don'ts of running a kingdom). Apparently, Chanakya used these sutras to groom Chandragupta and other selected disciples in the art of ruling a kingdom.
