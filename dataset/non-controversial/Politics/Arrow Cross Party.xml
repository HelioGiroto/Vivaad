The '''Arrow Cross Party''' ({{lang-hu|Nyilaskeresztes Párt – Hungarista Mozgalom}}, literally &quot;Arrow Cross Party-Hungarist Movement&quot;) was a [[national socialism|national socialist]] party led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]], which led in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungary]] a government known as the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]] from 15 October 1944 to 28 March 1945. During its short rule, ten to fifteen thousand people (many of whom were [[Jew]]s) were murdered outright,&lt;ref name=&quot;JOH&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|title=The Jews of Hungary:History, Culture, Psychology|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=590|year=1996|pages=730|isbn=0-8143-2561-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22the+jews+of+hungary%22&amp;ei=06nrSeGqEoyENKapuLQB&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA590,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 80,000 people were deported from Hungary to their deaths in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;polgar-age&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/15/1139890808344.html|title=War Crime Suspect Admits to his Leading Fascist Role|last=Johnston|first=Chris|date=2006-02-16|publisher=The Age|accessdate=2009-04-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090517100621/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/15/1139890808344.html| archivedate= 17 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Szálasi and other Arrow Cross leaders were tried as [[War crime|war criminals]] by Soviet courts.

==Formation==
[[File:Arrow Cross Party.jpg|left|thumb|Ministers of the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Arrow Cross Party government]]. [[Ferenc Szálasi]] is in the middle of the front row.]]

The party was founded by Ferenc Szálasi in 1935 as the Party of National Will.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE-Frucht&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Frucht|first=Richard C. |title=Eastern Europe: an Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=376|year=2005|pages=928|isbn=1-57607-800-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg=RA1-PA376&amp;dq=number+of+Arrow+Cross+Party+members&amp;ei=PcHrSceiHYakNcnm-YIO&amp;client=firefox-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had its origins in the political philosophy of pro-German extremists such as [[Gyula Gömbös]], who famously coined the term &quot;national socialism&quot; in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Miklos Molnar, 'A Concise History of Hungary&lt;/ref&gt; The party was outlawed in 1937 but was reconstituted in 1939 as the Arrow Cross Party, and was said to be modeled fairly explicitly on the [[Nazi Party]] of [[Germany]], although Szálasi often and harshly criticized the Nazi regime of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;nepszava.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszava.com/index.php?topic=102&amp;page=4147| title=Szálasi Ferenc és a hungaristák zsidópolitikája volt a jobb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the party was clearly inspired by that of the Nazis; the [[Arrow Cross]] emblem was an ancient symbol of the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] tribes who settled Hungary, thereby suggesting the racial purity of the Hungarians in much the same way that the Nazi [[swastika]] was intended to allude to the racial purity of the [[Aryan]]s{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.

==Ideology==
The party's ideology was similar to that of Nazism{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, although a more accurate comparison might be drawn between Austrofascism and Hungarian fascism which was called [[Hungarism]] by Ferenc Szálasi – extreme nationalism, the promotion of agriculture, anti-capitalism, anticommunism and militant antisemitism. The party and its leader were originally anti-German, so it was a long and very difficult process for Hitler to compromise with Szálasi and his party. The Arrow Cross Party conceived Jews in racial as well as religious terms, although the necessary scientific capital for a widespread and elaborate program of eugenics simply did not exist in Hungary at the time. Thus, although the Arrow Cross Party was certainly far more racist than the Judeophobic Horthyite regime, whose antisemitism was based solely on Christian belief, it was still very different from the German Nazi Party. The Arrow Cross Party was pro-Catholic and its antisemitism had its origins in Christian belief. It was also more economically radical than other fascist movements, advocating worker rights and land reforms. In a sense, the Arrow Cross Party was more like Germany's [[NSDAP]] prior to the [[Night of the Long Knives]] when the socialist faction among the Nazis (led by Ernst Roehm) was murdered or subjugated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Rise to power==
[[File:Azertis.jpg|thumb|left|A [[World War II]] propaganda poster for the party – the text reads &quot;Despite it all..!&quot;]]
The roots of Arrow Cross influence can be traced to the outburst of anti-Jewish feeling that followed the Communist putsch and brief rule in Hungary in the spring and summer of 1919. Some Communist leaders, like [[Tibor Szamuely]], came from Jewish families, or like [[Béla Kun]], its leader, who had a Jewish father and a Protestant Swabian mother, were considered to be Jews, and the failed and murderous policies of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] came to be associated in the minds of many Hungarians with a &quot;[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-Bolshevist conspiracy]].&quot;

After the communist regime was crushed in August 1919, conservatives under the leadership of [[Admiral]] [[Miklós Horthy]] took control of the nation. Many Hungarian military officers took part in the counter-reprisals known as the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] – some of that violence was directed at Jews, simply because they were Jewish.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Although the White Guard was officially suppressed, many of its most bloodthirsty members went underground and formed the core membership of a spreading nationalist and anti-Jewish movement.

During the 1930s, the Arrow Cross gradually began to dominate Budapest's working class district, defeating the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]]. It should be noted, however, that the Social Democrats did not really contest elections effectively; they had to make a pact with the conservative Horthy regime in order to prevent the abolition of their party.

The Arrow Cross subscribed to the Nazi ideology of &quot;[[master race]]s&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} which, in Szálasi's view, included the Hungarians and Germans, and also supported the concept of an order based on the power of the strongest – what Szálasi called a &quot;brutally realistic étatism&quot;. But its espousal of territorial claims under the banner of a &quot;[[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Greater Hungary]]&quot; and Hungarian values (which Szálasi labelled &quot;Hungarizmus&quot; or &quot;Hungarianism&quot;) clashed with Nazi ambitions in central Europe, delaying by several years Hitler's endorsement of that party.

The German Foreign Office instead endorsed the pro-German [[Hungarian National Socialist Party]], which had some support among German minorities. Before [[World War II]], the Arrow Cross were not proponents of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis, but utilized traditional stereotypes and prejudices to gain votes among voters both in [[Budapest]] and the countryside. However, the constant bickering among these diverse fascist groups prevented the Arrow Cross Party from gaining even more support and power.

The Arrow Cross obtained most of its support from a disparate coalition of military officers, soldiers, nationalists and agricultural workers. It was only one of a number of similar openly fascist factions in Hungary but was by far the most prominent, having developed an effective system of recruitment. When it contested the May 1939 elections – the only ones in which it participated – the party won more than 25% of the vote and 30 seats in the Hungarian Parliament. This was only a superficially impressive result; the majority of Hungarians were not permitted to vote. It did, however, become one of the most powerful parties in Hungary. But the Horthy leadership banned the Arrow Cross on the outbreak of World War II, forcing it to operate underground.

In 1944, the Arrow Cross Party's fortunes were abruptly reversed after Hitler lost patience with the reluctance of Horthy and his moderate prime minister, [[Miklós Kállay]], to toe the Nazi line fully. In March 1944, the Germans invaded and officially occupied Hungary; Kállay fled and was replaced by the Nazi proxy, [[Döme Sztójay]]. One of Sztójay's first acts was to legalize the Arrow Cross.

During the spring and summer of 1944, more than 400,000 Jews were herded into centralized ghettos and then deported from the Hungarian countryside to death camps by the Nazis, with the willing help of the Hungarian Interior Ministry and its gendarmerie (the ''csendőrség''), both of whose members had close links to the Arrow Cross. The Jews of Budapest were concentrated into so-called [[Yellow Star House]]s, approximately 2,000 single-building mini-ghettos identified by a yellow Star of David over the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patai |first=Raphael |title=The Jews of Hungary |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1944, before deportations from Budapest began, Horthy used what influence he had to stop the deportations and force the radical antisemites out of the government. As the summer progressed, and the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allied]] and [[Soviet Armies in WWII|Soviet armies]] closed in on central Europe, the ability of the Nazis to devote themselves to Hungary's &quot;Jewish Solution&quot; waned.

==Arrow Cross rule==
[[File:Holocaust-ArrowCross-DohanySynagogue.jpg|thumb|Jewish victims of Arrow Cross men in the court of the [[Dohány Street Synagogue]]]]
In October 1944, Horthy negotiated a cease-fire with the Soviets and ordered Hungarian troops to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]], a covert operation which forced Horthy to resign, after which he was put into &quot;protective custody&quot; in Germany. With Nazi approval, the Arrow Cross Party seized Budapest. Szálasi was declared &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot; and prime minister of a &quot;[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]&quot;.

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Romania]]n forces were already fighting in Hungary even before Szálasi's takeover, and by the time the Arrow Cross took power the [[Red Army]] was already far inside the country.  As a result, its jurisdiction was effectively limited to an ever-narrowing band of territory in central Hungary, around Budapest.  Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross rule, short-lived as it was, was brutal.  In fewer than three months, death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarians. Arrow Cross officers helped [[Adolf Eichmann]] re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had thus far been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labor details and many more straight to death camps. Many Jewish males of conscription age were already serving as slave labor for the Hungarian Army's [[Labour service (Hungary)|Forced Labor Battalions]].  Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home. Quickly formed battalions raided the Yellow Star Houses and combed the streets, hunting down Jews claimed to be partisans and saboteurs since Jews attacked Arrow Cross squads at least six to eight times with gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;remeny.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remeny.org/node/36| title=Szita Szabolcs: A budapesti csillagos házak (1944–45)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approximately 200 Jews were taken to the bridges crossing the Danube, where they were shot and their bodies borne away by the waters of the river because many were attached to weights while they were handcuffed to each other in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;from the Open Society Archives at Central European University, at http://www.osa.ceu.hu/galeria/sites/siege/section2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Army troops reached the outskirts of the city in December 1944, and the siege action known as the [[Battle of Budapest]] began, although it has often been claimed that there is no proof that the Arrow Cross members and the Germans conspired to destroy the Budapest ghetto.&lt;ref name=&quot;remeny.org&quot; /&gt; Days before he fled the city, Arrow Cross Interior Minister Gabor Vájna commanded that streets and squares named for Jews be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;Patai, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

As control of the city's institutions began to decay, the Arrow Cross trained their guns on the most helpless possible targets: patients in the beds of the city's two Jewish hospitals on Maros Street and Bethlen Square, and residents in the Jewish poorhouse on Alma Road. As order collapsed, Arrow Cross members continually sought to raid the ghettos and Jewish concentration buildings; the majority of Budapest's Jews were saved only by fearless and heroic efforts on the part of a handful of Jewish leaders and foreign diplomats, most famously the Swedish [[Raoul Wallenberg]], Swiss Consul [[Carl Lutz]] and [[Giorgio Perlasca]].&lt;ref&gt;Patai, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; Szálasi knew that the documents used by these diplomats to save Jews were invalid according to international law, but he allowed them to use those papers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nepszava.com&quot; /&gt;

[[Charles Ardai]], an American entrepreneur, novelist and book publisher, recounted in an Oct. 2008 National Public Radio interview an episode recalled by his mother, who survived the Holocaust in Hungary. Her family and other Budapest Jews were preparing to flee before the approach of Arrow Cross killers. They pleaded with two young boys who were family relatives to go with them, but they refused because their parents had told them to wait for them at home. As a result, the Arrow Cross men discovered the boys and killed them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The atrocities committed during the Arrow Cross rule, especially the mass murders of Jewish citizens, are depicted at length in [[György Konrad]]'s largely autobiographical novel ''Feast in the Garden'' (1989).

The Arrow Cross government effectively fell at the end of January 1945, when the Soviet Army took Pest and the fascist forces retreated across the Danube to Buda. Szálasi had escaped from Budapest on December 11, 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;nepszava.com&quot; /&gt; taking with him the [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Hungarian royal crown]], while Arrow Cross members and German forces continued to fight a rear-guard action in the far west of Hungary until the end of the war in April 1945. Many Jews were murdered in these final weeks because the Nyilas would not allow them to survive.

==Post-war developments==
[[File:Szalasi at people's court.jpg|thumb|Szálasi on trial in Budapest]]
After the war, many of the Arrow Cross leaders were captured and tried for [[war crime]]s. In the first months of postwar adjudication, no fewer than 6,200 indictments for murder were served against Arrow Cross men.&lt;ref&gt;Patai, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt; Some Arrow Cross officials, including Szálasi himself, were executed.

In 2006, a former high-ranking member of the Arrow Cross Party named [[Lajos Polgár]] was found to be living in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name = &quot;polgar-age&quot; /&gt; He was accused of war crimes, but the case was later dropped and Polgár died of natural causes in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajn.com.au/news/news.asp?pgID=1094 Lack of political will over Polgar, says Holocaust Centre], Australian Jewish News, July 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology of the Arrow Cross has resurfaced to some extent in recent years, with the [[neofascist]] Hungarian Welfare Association prominent in reviving Szálasi's &quot;Hungarizmus&quot; through its monthly magazine, ''Magyartudat'' (&quot;''Hungarian Awareness''&quot;). But &quot;Hungarism&quot; is very much a fringe element of modern Hungarian politics, and the Hungarian Welfare Association has since dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mno.hu/portal/396540&lt;/ref&gt;
