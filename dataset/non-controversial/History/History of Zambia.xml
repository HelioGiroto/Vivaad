      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28640">This article deals with the history of the country now called [[Zambia]] from [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times to the present.

== Early history ==

The original inhabitants of all of modern day Zambia were the Khoisans. They were bushman, and [[hunters and gatherers]] who lived a [[nomadic]] life, with [[stone age]] technology. Mainly they gathered [[fruits]] and nuts, but they also hunted [[antelope]] and other animals.

The Khoisans were the only inhabitants of most of Zambia until the 4th century, when  [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] started to migrate from the north. They had far more developed technology - they were [[farmers]] and had [[Iron (material)|iron]] and [[copper]] tools and weapons, as well as knowledge about [[pottery]] They were [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] and lived in small [[self-sufficient]] villages with a few houses, growing [[sorghum]] and [[beans]], as well as keeping [[cattle]] and [[goats]].

Since the early farmers practised [[slash and burn]] agriculture, they had to constantly move further south when the [[soil]] was exhausted. The [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] khoisans were either [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the new culture or pushed aside into areas not suitable for agriculture.

With the introduction of agriculture the population grew, and more and more land became cultivated. By the 11th and 12th centuries a more advanced society was beginning to emerge. Even though most villages still were self-sufficient, long distance [[trade]] was developing. Copper mining was intensified, and copper crosses were probably used as a [[currency]]. [[Ivory]] carvings and [[cotton]] textiles were other export commodities. One of the most famous [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites for this period is [[Ing-ombe Ilede]]. The increase in trade resulted in larger political units and more complex social structures.

==From 1500 to 1900==
The period between the 16th and the 19th centuries saw the emergence of organised [[Iron Age]] [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] as well as widespread immigration. Four kingdoms were established in this period - among the [[Eastern Lunda|Kazembe-Lunda]] in the north centered around the lower [[Luapula River]], the [[Bemba people|Bemba]] in the north east, the [[Chewa people|Chewa]] in the east and the [[Lozi]] in the west centered around the upper [[Zambezi River]].
 
The territory of the present Zambia, being far inland, did not have direct contact with non-Africans until relatively recently in its history. [[Arab]] and Portuguese traders were visiting by the 18th Century. The first recorded visits by Europeans to Zambia were the Portuguese [[Manuel Caetano Pereira]] (a trader of mixed [[Goa]]nese and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent) in 1796 and [[Francisco de Lacerda]] (an explorer) in 1798. Both came via [[Tete]] in [[Mozambique]] to [[Mwata Kazembe]]'s capital to try to get the chief's agreement to a Portuguese trade route between their territories of Mozambique and [[Angola]]. Lacerda died within a few weeks of arriving at Kazembe’s but left a valuable journal which was carried back to Tete by his priest and which was later translated into English by the explorer [[Sir Richard Burton]].&lt;ref&gt;William Govan Robertson: &quot;Kasembe and the Bemba (Awemba) Nation.&quot; ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', Vol. 3, No. 10 (Jan., 1904), pp. 183-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 1911 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is believed the Portuguese first settled in [[Zumbo]], Mozambique, in 1720, which is just across the [[Luangwa River]] from Zambia, at the confluence with the [[Zambezi River]]. Around 1820 they had settled on the Zambian side at [[Luangwa, Zambia|Feira (now Luangwa)]]. So it is very likely they were visiting Zambian territory between 1720 and 1820.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V5N1/V5N1.htm  ''The Northern Rhodesia Journal'' online], Volume V No. 1 (1962) p43. Accessed 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[United Kingdom|Briton]] to set his foot on Zambian soil was [[David Livingstone]]. In 1851 he started his famous exploration of the upper [[Zambezi River]], and in 1855 he became the first European to see [[Victoria Falls|Mosi-oa-Tunya]], the waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]], which he named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and the Zambian town near the falls is named after him. Livingstone later [[Livingstone Memorial|died in Zambia]] in 1873.

When the first Europeans arrived, the most powerful states in precolonial Zambia were the kingdom of [[Barotseland]] in the upper Zambezi, and the kingdom of [[Mwata Kazembe]] on the Luapula. 

The [[Lozi people]] of Barotseland had prevented access to their land by Arab and Portuguese traders. When the kingdom was first established is uncertain, but it was certainly in existence by the 18th century, the Lozi calling themselves Aluya and their country Ngulu. Its ruler was called the [[Litunga]], and had two capitals: in the [[dry season]] he stayed at [[Lealui]], while in the [[rainy season]] he moved to [[Limulunga]], a move that is still celebrated in the [[Kuomboka]] annual [[festival]].

The first certain historical fact concerning Barotseland is in the early 19th century the trek of the [[Makololo]], a clan of the [[South Africa|South-African]] [[Basotho]] or [[Tswana people]]. Utterly defeated by [[Shaka]]'s new [[Zulu Kingdom]] in the 1820s, the Makololo under the guide of [[Sebetwane]] were forced to march north until they conquered the Lozi and became the aristocracy of Barotseland, with Sebitwane as new ''Litunga''.

Sebetwane proved an able leader, and is spoken of with warm respect by [[David Livingstone]], who met him in 1851 shortly before his death. He was succeeded by his daughter [[Mamochisane]], who early stepped down in favour of her half-brother [[Sekeletu]]. With him the Makololo empire appears to have started to fall to pieces, especially after his death in 1863: a year later internal dissension in the ruling class brought to a revolt by the Lozi that is said to have exterminated the Makololo aristocracy and forced the survivors to migrate to present-day [[Malawi]].

By the 18th century, British settlers came in.

==Colonial Period==

[[Image:CecilRhodes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Cecil Rhodes]].]]

{{main|Northern Rhodesia}}

In 1888, [[Cecil Rhodes]], spearheading British commercial and political interests in [[Central Africa]], obtained a mineral rights concession from local chiefs. In the same year, Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]], now [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], were proclaimed a British [[sphere of influence]]. To start with the territory was administered by Rhodes' [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC), which showed little interest  for the province and used it mainly as a supplier of cheap labour.

The most important factor in the colony's economy was copper.  The discovery of copper is owed partly to an American scout, [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], who in 1895 lead and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which established for the Western world that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter1970&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=T.W. |coauthors= E.E. Burke |title=Guide to the Historical Manuscripts in the National Archives of Rhodesia |page=67 |year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Kafue River]] in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered natives wearing copper bracelets.&lt;ref name=&quot;scouting&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; company |year=1926 |location=|pages=2; Chapters 3 &amp; 4 |id={{OCLC|407686}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the BSAC built railroad to transport the copper through Mozambique.&lt;ref name=&quot;juang2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Juang |first=Richard M. |title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia, Volume 2 Transatlantic relations series |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1157 |year=2008 |isbn=1-85109-441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 the British government decided not to renew the company's [[charter]]; as a result, [[Southern Rhodesia]] was annexed formally and granted self-government in 1923. After negotiations the administration of [[Northern Rhodesia]] was transferred to the British [[Colonial Office]] in 1924 as a [[protectorate]], with [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] as capital. It was later transferred to [[Lusaka]] in 1935. A [[Legislative Council]] was established, of which five members were elected by the small European minority (only 4,000 people), but none by the African population.

[[Image:Flag of Northern Rhodesia-1939.svg|thumb|200px|left|Flag of [[Northern Rhodesia]].]]

In 1928 important discoveries were made in the region from then on called [[Copperbelt]] - enormous [[copper]] deposits were found, transforming Northern Rhodesia from a prospective land of colonization for white farmers to a copper exporter. Already in 1938 it produced 13% of world's copper extracted. The sector was immediately monopolized by the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Corporation]] (AAC, [[United States|North-American]]) and the [[Rhodesian Selection Trust]] (RST, South African), who would control the sector till independence. 

The bad security conditions and increased taxes helped to trigger a [[Strike action|strike]] of African mineworkers in 1935, known as the [[Copperbelt strike (1935)|Copperbelt strike]]. The strike was crushed by the authorities that killed 13 miners in the repression.

During the [[Second World War]] white miners came out on strike in 1940. Realising the importance of their products for the war, they demanded higher salaries. This strike was followed by another by African mineworkers.        

Even before the war, there had been talks about merging the two Rhodesias, but the process had been halted by the British authorities, and brought to an absolute stop by the war. Finally, in 1953, both Rhodesias were joined with [[Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]) to form the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. Northern Rhodesia was the centre of much of the turmoil and crisis that characterized the federation in its last years. At the core of the controversy were insistent African demands for greater participation in government and European fears of losing political control. 

A [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1962|two-stage election]] held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new national assembly based on a broader, more democratic franchise. On 31 December 1963, the federation was dissolved, and [[Northern Rhodesia]] became the [[Republic of Zambia]] on [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|24 October 1964]].

==Independence and Cold War==

[[Image:Zambia Ind000.jpg|thumb|130px|right|A book published by the government upon independence.]]

At independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government, and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. Abroad many of Zambia's neighbouring countries were still [[colony|colonies]] or under white [[minority rule]].

The [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) won the [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1964|pre-independence elections]], gaining 55 of the 75 seats. The [[Zambian African National Congress]] won 10 seats, and the [[National Progressive Party (Zambia)|National Progressive Party]] won all the 10 seats reserved for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;elections&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-10-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Kaunda]] was elected [[Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia|Prime Minister]], and later the same year president, as the country adopted a presidential system.

Kaunda adopted an [[ideology]] of [[African socialism]], close to that of [[Julius Nyerere]] in [[Tanzania]]. Economical policies focused on [[central planning]] and [[nationalisation]], and a system of [[one party rule]] was put in place.

=== Towards one party rule ===
In 1968 Kaunda was [[Zambian general election, 1968|re-elected as president]], running unopposed. During the following years Zambia adopted a one party system. In 1972 all political parties except UNIP were banned, and this was formalised in a new constitution that was adopted in 1973. The constitution framed a system called &quot;one-party participatory democracy&quot;, which in practise meant that UNIP became the sole political factor in the country. It provided for a strong [[President of Zambia|president]] and a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]]. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy. In legislative elections, only candidates running for UNIP was allowed to participate. Even though inter-party competition was out of question, the contest for seats within UNIP was energetic. In the presidential elections, the only candidate allowed to run was the one elected as president of UNIP at the party's general conference. In this way Kaunda was re-elected unopposed with a yes or no vote in [[Zambian general election, 1973|1973]], [[Zambian general election, 1978|1978]], [[Zambian general election, 1983|1983]] and [[Zambian general election, 1988|1988]].

[[File:Chisembele, S.M..jpg|thumb|right|100px|S.M Chisembele, Cabinet Minister Western Province.]]
This did not, however, mean that there was no dissension to the imposition of a one-party rule in the country or within UNIP.  [[Sylvester Mwamba Chisembele]] who was Cabinet Minister for Western Province (previously Barotse Province) together with UNIP leaders from 7 out of the 8 Provinces established a Committee of 14. The objective of the Committee of 14 which consisted two leaders from each of the 7 provinces was the establishment of a democratically elected council of two leaders from each province to rule the country by consensus with the President as Head of State.  If this had been achieved, it would have meant the curtailing of the absolute power residing in President Kaunda.   The Committee of 14 attended a meeting in State House at which President Kaunda agreed to consider their proposals.  However, later he banned the Committee of 14 and this action was followed by the suspension of Sylvester Chisembele and several leaders were sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=&quot;Zambia Daily Mail&quot;|date=21 April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chisembele later rejoined the Cabinet as Minister for Eastern Province and two years later in 1977 he was transferred in the same position to the Copperbelt Province, where the political situation was tense, especially so because of the forthcoming General Elections.  Simon M. Kapwepwe and Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula who before the declaration of a One Party State had been leaders of the UPP and ANC political parties respectively, had joined UNIP with the intention of challenging for the Presidency.   However, their attempt to challenge President Kaunda for the Presidency on the UNIP ticket failed as both were prevented and disqualified by the manipulations of President Kaunda, who stood unopposed.  Simon Kapwepwe and Harry Nkumbula challenged the resultant 1978 election of President Kaunda in the High Court, but their action was unsurprisingly unsuccessful.

===The economy and the copper crisis===
After independence Zambia adopted a [[Left (politics)|left]]-wing economic policy. The economy was to some extent run by central planning, under five year plans, private companies were [[nationalised]] and incorporated into large state-owned conglomerates. The government's goal was to be self-sufficient, which it sought to achieve through [[import substitution]]. At first the plan worked out and the economy grew steadily, but in the mid 1970s the economy started to decline drastically. During the period between 1975 and 1990 Zambia's economy dropped by approximately 30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EconomyDrop&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.bized.co.uk/virtual/dc/back/econ.htm
| title = Zambia - Economic History 
| publisher = [http://www.bized.co.uk Biz/ed]
| accessdate = 2006-10-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this was that the Zambian economy was heavily dependent on the copper industry, which had previously been nationalised. During the 1970s the price of copper sank drastically, resulting in a large [[deficit spending|deficit]] for the state owned enterprise. Another reason for the drop was Zambia's involvement in the neighbouring countries politics, and the transportation problems that resulted.

To deal with the crisis Zambia took big loans from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Worldbank]], hoping that copper prices would rise again soon, instead of issuing structural reforms.

===Foreign policy===
Internationally, Zambia's sympathies lay with forces opposing colonial or white-dominated rule. During the next decade, it actively supported movements such as the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA) under the independence war and under the subsequent [[Angolan civil war|civil war]], the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and  in [[Southern Rhodesia]], the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in their struggle against [[apartheid]] in [[South African Republic]], and the [[South-West Africa People's Organization]] (SWAPO) in their struggle for independence for [[Namibia]]. Zambia also hosted some of the movements. For instance, the ANC exile head quarters were in Lusaka, and ZAPU had a military base in Zambia. This resulted in security problems, as the South Africa and South Rhodesia raided targets inside Zambia on several occasions.

[[Rhodesian Bush War|Rhodesian counterinsurgency operation]] extended into Zambia after  [[ZIPRA]] rebels shot down two unarmed [[Vickers Viscount]] civilian airliners ([[Air Rhodesia Flight 825]] on 3 September 1978 and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]] on 12 February 1979) with Soviet supplied [[SA-7 Grail|SAM-7]] heat-seeking missiles. In retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, [[Rhodesian Air Force]] attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conflicts with Rhodesia resulted in the closing of Zambia's borders with that country and severe problems with international transport and power supply. However, the [[Kariba Dam|Kariba]] [[hydroelectric]] station on the [[Zambezi River]] provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country's requirements for electricity. [[TAZARA]], a railroad to the Tanzanian port of [[Dar es Salaam]], built with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on railroad lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly war ravaged Angola. 

Civil strife in neighbouring [[Mozambique]] and Angola created large amounts of [[refugees]], large numbers of whom fled to Zambia.

Internationally, Zambia was an active member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), and hosted a summit in Lusaka in 1970 and Kenneth Kaunda served as the movements chairman 1970-1973. Among the NAM countries Zambia was especially close to [[Yugoslavia]]. Outside the NAM Zambia also had close relations with the [[Peoples Republic of China]].

In the [[Second Congo War]], Zambia backed Zimbabwe and the Congo but did not participate as a belligerent .

==Multi-party democracy==

===The end of one party rule===
[[Image:ZambiaACCPoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A poster from the Anti Corruption Commission.{{deletable image-caption|Friday, 9 November 2012}}]]
One party rule and the declining economy created disappointment among the people. Several [[strike action|strike]]s hit the country in 1981. The government responded by arresting several [[trade union|union]] leaders, among them [[Frederick Chiluba]]. In 1986 and 1987 protests arose again in [[Lusaka]] and the [[Copperbelt]]. These were followed by riots over rising food prices in 1991, in which at least 30 people were killed. The same year the state owned radio claimed that Kaunda had been removed from office by the [[Military of Zambia|army]]. This was not true, and the [[coup]] attempt failed.

These extensive protests made Kaunda realise the need for [[reform movement|reform]]. He promised a [[referendum]] on [[multiparty democracy]], and lifted the ban on political parties. This resulted in the quick formation of eleven new parties. Among these [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy]] (MMD), led by former union leader Frederick Chiluba, was the most important. After pressure for the new parties the referendum was canceled in favour for direct multiparty election.

===Frederick Chiluba and the MMD===
After a new [[constitution]] had been drafted, [[Zambian general election, 1991|elections]] were held in 1991. They were generally regarded to have been free and fair, and Chiluba won 76% of the presidential vote, and the MMD 125 of the 150 seats in the [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]], with the UNIP taking the remaining 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;elections&quot;/&gt;

Economically Chiluba, despite being a former union leader, stood to the right of Kaunda. With support from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]], to which Zambia was heavily indebted, he liberalised the economy by restricting government interference, privatising state owned enterprise, such as the important copper mining industry, and removing subsidies on different commodities, most notably on [[corn meal]].

When one party rule was first abolished in 1991, many expected a more democratic future for Zambia. These expectations were  however clouded by the MMD's treatment of the opposition. Questionable amendments of the constitution and detentions of political opponents caused major criticism, and some donor countries, i.e., the United Kingdom and Denmark, withdrew their [[aid]].

====Coups and emergencies====
In 1993 the government owned newspaper ''[[The Times of Zambia]]'' reported a story about a secret UNIP plan to take control of government by unconstitutional means, called the &quot;Zero Operation Plan&quot;. The plan included industrial unrest, promotion of violence and organisations of mass protests. The UNIP did not deny the existence of such a plan, but underlined that it was not a part of their official policy, but the views of extremists within the party. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and putting 26 people into detention. Of these seven, including Kenneth Kaunda's son [[Wezi Kaunda]] were charged with offences against the security of the state. The rest were released.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Zambian general election, 1996|1996 elections]], the UNIP formed an alliance with six other opposition parties. Kenneth Kaunda had earlier retired from politics, but after internal turbulence in the party, due to the &quot;Zero Operation Plan&quot; scandal, he returned, replacing his own successor [[Kebby Musokotwane]]. Chiluba's government then amended the constitution, banning people whose parents were not both Zambian citizens from becoming president. This was directly aimed at Kaunda, whose parents were both from [[Malawi]]. In protest the UNIP and its allies boycotted the elections, which were then easily won by Chiluba and the MMD.

In 1997 matters escalated. On 28 October a [[coup d'état]] took place, as a group of army commanders took control over the national radio station, broadcasting a message stating that Chiluba was no longer president. The coup was brought to an end by regular forces, after Chiluba had again declared a state of emergency. One person was killed during the operation. After the failed coup the police arrested at least 84 people accused of involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The arrests were condemned and criticised as illegal inside as well as outside Zambia, and accusations of [[torture]] were made as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====2001 elections====
Prior to the [[Zambian general election, 2001|elections in 2001]] Chiluba tried to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. He was forced to step back on this point after protest from within the party as well as from the Zambian public.
