The '''Crusade of Varna''' was a string of events in 1443&amp;ndash;44 between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Serbian Despotate]], the [[Wallachia|Principality of Wallachia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It culminated in a devastating Christian loss at the [[Battle of Varna]] on November 10, 1444.

==Background==
In 1428, while the [[Ottoman Empire]] was fighting a war with the [[Republic of Venice]], the Ottomans and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] achieved a temporary peace by establishing the [[Serbian Despotate]] as a [[buffer state]].  After the war ended in 1430,&lt;ref name=Venice&gt;{{cite web | last = Ganse | first = Alexander | title = History of Warfare | url = http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxvenice.html | date = June 6, 2005 | work = World History at [[Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|KLMA]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bartleby&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Stearns, Peter N., et al | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern | title = 5.

In 1432, [[Sultan]] [[Murad II]] began raiding into [[Transylvania]].  After King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] died in 1437, the attacks intensified, with the Ottomans occupying [[Borač]] in 1438 and [[Zvornik]] and [[Srebrenica]] in 1439.  At the end of 1439, [[Smederevo]] capitulated and Murad succeeded in making Serbia an Ottoman province.  [[Đurađ Branković]], [[Despotes|Despot]] of Serbia, fled to his estates in Hungary.  In 1440, Murad besieged Hungary's main border fortress, [[Belgrade]].  After failing to take the fortress, he was forced to return to [[Anatolia]] to stop attacks by the [[Karamanids]].&lt;ref name=sugar&gt;{{cite book | last = Sugar | first = Peter | title = Southeastern Europe Under Ottoman Rule, 1354&amp;ndash;1804 | origyear = 1977 | format = Reprint | publisher = [[University of Washington Press]] | chapter = Chapter 1: The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe | chapterurl = http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/sugar.html | accessdate = 2007-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=varna&gt;{{cite book | last = Imber | first = Colin | title = The Crusade of Varna, 1443-45 | year = 2006 | month = July | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-0144-7  | pages = 9&amp;ndash;31 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=xeuaoghuq3cC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=battle+of+Zlatitsa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i8XsTdOcAs7usgbUstTnCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=battle%20of%20Zlatitsa&amp;f=false | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Sigismund's successor [[Albert II of Germany|Albert]] had died in October 1439, shortly after signing a law to &quot;restore the ancient laws and customs of the realm&quot;.  The law restricted the [[Monarchy|royal authority]] by requiring the participation of [[landed nobility]] in political decisions.  Four months after Albert's death, his only son, [[Ladislas the Posthumous|Ladislaus]], was born while Hungary was in the midst of a civil war over the next monarch.  On July 17, 1440, [[Władysław III of Poland|Vladislaus]], king of [[Poland]], was crowned despite continuing disputes.&lt;ref name=1911EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Classic Encyclopedia | title = Wladislaus III | url = http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Wladislaus_III | edition = Reprint of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] | year = 2006 | publisher = LoveToKnow 1911 | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Hunyadi]] aided Vladislaus's cause by pacifying the eastern counties, gaining him the position of [[Voivode]] of Transylvania and the corresponding responsibility of protecting Hungary's southern border.  By the end of 1442, Vladislaus had secured his status in Hungary, and denied an Ottoman proposal of peace in exchange for Belgrade.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], meanwhile, had long been advocating for a crusade against the Ottomans, and with the end of both the Hungarian civil war and a nearly simultaneous one in [[Byzantium]], they were able to realistically begin negotiations and planning.  The impetus required to turn the plans into action was provided by Hunyadi between 1441&amp;ndash;42.  In 1441, he defeated a raid led by [[Ishak Pasha]] of Smederevo.&lt;ref name=sugar/&gt;  He nearly annihilated [[Mezid Bey]]'s army in Transylvania on March 22, 1442, and in September he defeated the revenge attack of [[Şihabeddin Pasha]], governor-general of [[Rumelia]].&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;  Branković, hoping to liberate Serbia, also lent his support after [[Novo Brdo]], the last major Serbian city, fell to the Ottomans in 1441.

==The Crusade==
===Early fighting===
On January 1, 1443, [[Pope Eugene IV]] published a crusading [[Papal bull|bull]].  In early May, it was reported &quot;that the Turks were in a bad state and that it would be easy to expel them from Europe&quot;,&lt;!-- War was proclaimed against Sultan Murad II. at the diet of Buda on Palm Sunday 1443, and with an army of 40,000 men, mostly Magyars, the young monarch, with Hunyadi commanding under him, crossed the Danube, took Nish and Sofia...&lt;ref name=1911EB/&gt;  Where does that fit in with this crusading bull?  Is it even referring to the same thing, or not? --&gt; though the success of the crusade still required the simultaneous attacks of both the Hungarian and Karamanid armies.  However, in the spring of 1443, before the Hungarians were ready, the Karamanids attacked the Ottoman Empire and were devastated by Murad's full army.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

The Hungarian army, led by Vladislaus, Hunyadi, and Branković, attacked in mid-October.  They correctly expected that Murad would not be able to quickly mobilize his army, which consisted mainly of [[fief]]-holding cavalrymen who needed to collect the harvest to pay taxes.  Hunyadi's experience of winter campaigns from 1441&amp;ndash;42 added to the Hungarian's advantage.  They also had better armor, often rendering the Ottoman weapons useless.  Murad could not rely on the loyalty of his troops from Rumelia, and had difficulties countering Hungarian tactics.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

As the Hungarians advanced, they forced [[Kasim Pasha]] of Rumelia and his co-commander [[Turahan Bey]] to abandon camp and flee to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] to warn Murad of the invasion.  However, the two burned all the villages in their path in an attempt to wear down the Hungarians with a [[scorched earth]] tactic.  When they arrived in Sofia, they advised the Sultan to burn the city and retreat to the mountain passes beyond, where the Ottoman's smaller army would not be such a disadvantage.  Shortly after, bitter cold set in, and the next encounter, fought at [[Zlatitsa]] Pass just before [[Christmas]] 1443, was fought in the snow.  The Hungarians were defeated.  As they marched home, however, they ambushed and defeated a pursuing force in [[Dragoman, Bulgaria|Dragoman]] Pass, where [[Mahmud Bey]]&lt;!-- aka Mahmud Çelebi --&gt;, son-in-law of the Sultan and brother of the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Çandarlı (2nd) Halil Pasha|Çandarlı Halil Pasha]], was taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

While the battle at Zlatitsa Pass had been a disaster, the ambush returned to the Hungarians the illusion of an overall Christian victory, and they returned triumphant.  The King and Church were both anxious to maintain the illusion and gave instructions to spread word of the victories, but contradict anyone who mentioned the loss.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

Murad, meanwhile, returned angry and dejected by the unreliability of his forces, and imprisoned Turahan after blaming him for the army's setbacks and Mahmud Bey's capture.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

===Peace proposals===
Murad is believed to have had the greatest wish for peace.  Among other things, his sister begged him to obtain her husband Mahmud's release, and his wife [[Mara Branković|Mara]], daughter of Đurađ Branković, added additional pressure.  On March 6, 1444, Mara sent an envoy to Branković; their discussion started the peace negotiations with the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

On April 24, 1444, Vladislaus sent a letter to Murad, stating that his ambassador, Stojka Gisdanić, was travelling to [[Edirne]] with full powers to negotiate on his behalf.  He asked that, once an agreement was reached, Murad send his own ambassadors with the treaty and his sworn oath to Hungary, at which point Vladislaus could also swear.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

That same day, Vladislaus held a [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Buda]], where he swore before [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Julian Cesarini]] to lead a new expedition against the Ottomans in the summer.  The strongest remaining supporter of Ladislaus' claim for the throne also agreed to a truce, thus removing the danger of another civil war.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

Between June and August, 1444, negotiations for a treaty were carried out, first in [[Edirne]], and then in [[Szeged]].  The Hungarians were not entirely interested in peace, however, especially with Cesarini pushing for the crusade's continuation.  The Cardinal eventually found a solution that would allow for both the continuation of fighting, and the ratification of the treaty, and on August 15, 1444, the [[Peace of Szeged]] was sworn into effect.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

===Final stage===
Shortly after all the short-term requirements of the treaty were fulfilled, the Hungarians and their allies resumed the crusade.  Murad, who had retired shortly after the treaty was completed, was called back to lead the Ottoman army.  On November 10, 1444, the two armies clashed at the [[Battle of Varna]] (near the [[Black Sea]] fortress of [[Varna]], Bulgaria).  The Ottomans won a decisive victory despite heavy losses, while the Hungarians lost their King and over 10,000 men.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Many were crippled by [[frostbite]], many more died in smaller follow-up battles, and most European prisoners were killed or sold into [[slavery]].  Hungary fell back into civil war until Hunyadi was elected [[Regent]] for the infant [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus]] in June 1446.  Branković retained control over Serbia.  The Ottoman Empire was free, for several decades, from any further serious attempts to push it out of Europe.&lt;ref name=varna/&gt;
