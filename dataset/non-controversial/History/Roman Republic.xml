{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}
The '''Roman Republic''' ({{lang-la|Res-publica Romanorum}}) was the period of the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman civilization]] when the government operated as a [[republic]]. It began with the overthrow of the [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]], traditionally dated around 509 BC, and its replacement by a government headed by two [[Roman consul|consuls]], elected annually by the citizens and advised by a [[Roman senate|senate]]. A [[constitution of the Roman Republic|complex constitution]] gradually developed, centered on the principles of a [[separation of powers]] and [[checks and balances]]. Except in times of dire national emergency, public offices were limited to one year, so that, in theory at least, no single individual could dominate his fellow citizens.

[[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman society was hierarchical]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War, p.368, University of California Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Henry T. Nguyen, Christian Identity in Corinth: A Comparative Study of 2 Corinthians, Epictetus and Valerius Maximums, p.24, Mohr Siebeck, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the [[History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic|Constitution of the Roman Republic]] was heavily influenced by the struggle between the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry back to the early history of the Roman kingdom, and the [[plebeians]], the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and a new aristocracy emerged from among the plebeian class. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong [[mos maiorum|tradition and morality]] requiring public service and [[patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. During the first two centuries of its existence the Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century it included North Africa, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Greece, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, despite the Republic's traditional and lawful constraints against any individual's acquisition of permanent political powers, Roman politics was dominated by a small number of Roman leaders, their uneasy alliances punctuated by a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]].

The victor in one of these civil wars, [[Augustus|Octavian]], reformed the Republic as a [[Principate]], with himself as Rome's &quot;first citizen&quot; ([[princeps]]). The Senate continued to sit and debate. Annual magistrates were elected as before, but final decisions on matters of policy, warfare, diplomacy and appointments were privileged to the princeps as &quot;first among equals&quot; later to be known as [[imperator]] due to the holding of [[imperium]], from which the term [[emperor]] is derived. His powers were monarchic in all but name, and he held them for his lifetime, on behalf of the [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]]. The Roman Republic was never restored, but neither was it abolished, so the exact date of the transition to the [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed the appointment of [[Julius Caesar]] as perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] in 44 BC, the defeat of [[Mark Antony]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the [[Roman Senate]]'s grant of extraordinary powers to under the [[Augustus#First settlement|first settlement]] and Octavian adopting the moniker [[Augustus]] in 27 BC, as the defining [[Epoch (reference date)|event]] ending the Republic.

Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern [[nation state]]s and [[international organizations]]. [[Latin]], the language of the Romans, has influenced language across parts of Europe and the world.

==Constitution==
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The Constitution of the Roman Republic was an unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 161&quot;&gt;Byrd, 161&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman constitution was not formal or even official. It was largely unwritten, uncodified, and constantly evolving.

[[File:Forum Romanium 1RB.JPG|thumb|The [[Roman Forum]], the commercial, cultural, and political center of the city and the Republic which housed the various offices and meeting places of the government]]

===Senate of the Roman Republic===
{{Main|Senate of the Roman Republic}}
The [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Senate's]] ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 96&quot;&gt;Byrd, 96&lt;/ref&gt; This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the high calibre and prestige of the Senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cicero, 239&quot;&gt;Cicero, 239&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consulta''. This was officially &quot;advice&quot; from the Senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, these were usually obeyed by the magistrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 44&quot;&gt;Byrd, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 133&quot;&gt;Polybius, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs.

===Legislative Assemblies===
{{Main|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic}}

The legal status of Roman citizenship was strictly limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. Not all those rights were available to every citizen - women could be citizens, but were denied the right to vote or hold elected office.

An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called &quot;optimo jure.&quot; The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 134&quot;&gt;Polybius, 134&lt;/ref&gt; enacted legislation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 135&quot;&gt;Polybius, 135&lt;/ref&gt; presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 134&quot;/&gt; There were [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Comitia, Concilium, Conventio|two types of legislative assemblies]]. The first was the ''comitia'' (&quot;committees&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Lintott, 42&quot;&gt;Lintott, 42&lt;/ref&gt; which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the ''concilia'' (&quot;councils&quot;), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 251&quot;&gt;Abbott, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assembly of the Centuries====
Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and [[Tribe of Rome|tribes]]. The centuries and the tribes would each gather into their own assemblies. The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Centuries|Comitia Centuriata]] (&quot;Century Assembly&quot;) was the assembly of the centuries. The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul.&lt;ref name = &quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt; The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had ''imperium'' powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 257&quot;&gt;Abbott, 257&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cicero, 241&quot;&gt;Cicero, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assembly of the Tribes====
The assembly of the tribes, the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul,&lt;ref name = &quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt; and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lintott, 51&quot;&gt;Lintott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Tribes|order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in]] was selected randomly by lot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, 77&quot;&gt;Taylor, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule [[aedile]]s, and military tribunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, 7&quot;&gt;Taylor, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plebeian Council====
The Plebeian Council&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 196&quot;&gt;Abbott, 196&lt;/ref&gt; was an assembly of plebeians, the non-patrician citizens of Rome, who would gather into their respective tribes. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal. Since it was organised on the basis of the tribes, its rules and procedures were nearly identical to those of the Comitia Tributa.

===Executive Magistrates===
{{Main|Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic}}
Each magistrate was vested with a degree of ''maior potestas'' (&quot;major power&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 151&quot;&gt;Abbott, 151&lt;/ref&gt; Each magistrate could veto any action that was taken by a magistrate of an equal or lower rank. [[tribune|Plebeian tribunes]] and [[aedile|plebeian aediles]], on the other hand, were independent of the other magistrates.&lt;ref name = &quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 151&quot;/&gt;

====Magisterial powers, and checks on those powers====
Each republican magistrate held certain [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Powers|constitutional powers]]. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians ''and'' patricians) had the right to confer these powers on any individual magistrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lintott, 95&quot;&gt;Lintott, 95&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful constitutional power was ''imperium''. ''[[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Imperium|Imperium]]'' was held by both consuls and praetors. ''Imperium'' gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Coercitio|coercion]]. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lintott, 97&quot;&gt;Lintott, 97&lt;/ref&gt; While in Rome, all citizens had a judgement against coercion. This protection was called ''provocatio'' (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.

One check on a magistrate's power was his [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Collega|collegiality]]. Each magisterial office would be held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was ''[[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Provocatio|provocatio]]''. ''Provocatio'' was a primordial form of [[due process]]. It was a precursor to ''[[habeas corpus]]''. If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cicero, 235&quot;&gt;Cicero, 235&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, once a magistrate's one year term ofoffice expired, he would have to [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Annual Terms|wait ten years]] before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their ''imperium'' extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a [[promagistrate]]), without officially holding that office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lintott, 113&quot;&gt;Lintott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consuls, praetors, censors, aediles, quaestors, tribunes, and dictators====
{{Roman government}}
The [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Consuls|consuls]] of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary magistrates; each consul served for one year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government.&lt;ref name = &quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt; They would preside over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 132&quot;&gt;Polybius, 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 179&quot;&gt;Byrd, 179&lt;/ref&gt; His authority abroad would be nearly absolute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polybius, 132&quot;/&gt;

[[Praetor]]s administered civil law&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 32&quot;&gt;Byrd, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and commanded provincial armies. Every five years, two [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Censors|censors]] were elected for an 18 month term. During their term in office, the two censors would conduct a [[census]]. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from the senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 26&quot;&gt;Byrd, 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Curule aediles|Aediles]] were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#Quaestors|quaestors]] would usually assist the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.

Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were [[sacrosanct]]. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 23&quot;&gt;Byrd, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of military emergency, a [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic#The dictator and the &quot;ultimate decree of the senate&quot;|dictator]] would be appointed for a term of six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrd, 24&quot;&gt;Byrd, 24&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cicero, 237&quot;&gt;Cicero, 237&lt;/ref&gt; When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.

==Political history==
{{Main|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The constitutional history of the Roman Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] in 509 BC. The final phase ended with the transition that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the history of the Republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the [[conflict of the orders]] between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.

===Patrician Era (509–367 BC)===
According to legend, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was overthrown in 509 BC by a group of noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus.  Tarquin is said to have made a number of attempts to retake the throne, including the [[Tarquinian conspiracy]], the [[Roman-Etruscan_Wars#War_with_Veii_and_Tarquinii.2C_after_the_overthrow_of_the_monarchy_in_509_BC|war with Veii and Tarquinii]] and finally the [[Roman-Etruscan_Wars#War_with_Clusium_in_508_BC|war between Rome and Clusium]], all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives.

The historical monarchy, as the legends suggest, was probably overthrown quickly, but the constitutional changes which occurred immediately after the revolution were probably not as extensive as the legends suggest. The most important constitutional change probably concerned the chief executive. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two [[Roman consul|consul]]s were elected by the citizens for an annual term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 25&quot;&gt;Abbott, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. Consular political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were no different from those of the old king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 26&quot;&gt;Abbott, 26&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the senate and the assemblies were as powerless as they had been under the monarchy.

In 494 BC, the city was at war with two neighbouring tribes. The plebeian soldiers refused to march against the enemy, and instead [[Secessio plebis|seceded]] to the [[Aventine Hill]]. The plebeians demanded the right to elect their own officials. The patricians agreed, and the plebeians returned to the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 28&quot;&gt;Abbott, 28&lt;/ref&gt; The plebeians called these new officials &quot;[[Constitution of the Roman Republic#Plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles|plebeian tribunes]]&quot;. The tribunes would have two assistants, called &quot;[[aedile|plebeian aediles]]&quot;. From 375 BC to 371 BC, the republic experienced a constitutional crisis during which the Tribunes of the People used their vetoes to prevent the election of senior magistrates.  In 367 BC a law was passed, which required the election of at least one plebeian aedile each year. In 443 BC, the [[Roman censor|censorship]] was created, and in 366 BC, the praetorship was created. Also in 366 BC, the curule aedileship was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 37&quot;&gt;Abbott, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the founding of the Republic, the Comitia Centuriata (&quot;Assembly of the Centuries&quot;) became the principal legislative assembly. In this assembly, magistrates were elected, and laws were passed.

During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed. The result of these reforms was that any law passed by the Plebeian Council would have the full force of law. This gave the tribunes (who presided over the Plebeian Council) a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, the only power that the tribunes held was that of the veto.

===Conflict of the Orders (367–287 BC)===
{{Main|Conflict of the Orders}}
After the plebeian aedileship had been created, the patricians created the curule aedileship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 42-43&quot;&gt;Abbott, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic#Senate|dictatorship]] and the censorship. [[Plebeian Council|Plebiscites]] of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 43&quot;&gt;Abbott, 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''Ab Urbe Condita'']], Book 7, 42: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0154%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D42 link to perseus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 42&quot;&gt;Abbott, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 44&quot;&gt;Abbott, 44&lt;/ref&gt; To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 45&quot;&gt;Abbott, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the middle of the 4th century BC, the Concilium Plebis enacted the &quot;Ovinian Law&quot;. During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. The Ovinian law, however, gave this power to the censors. It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 46&quot;&gt;Abbott, 46&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 47&quot;&gt;Abbott, 47&lt;/ref&gt; The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only patricians were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed due to the organization of society. As such, only a revolution could overthrow this new structure.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 48&quot;/&gt;

By 287 BC, the economic condition of the average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the [[Janiculum|Janiculum hill]]. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the &quot;Hortensian Law&quot;), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 52&quot;&gt;Abbott, 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 51&quot;&gt;Abbott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 53&quot;&gt;Abbott, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The plebeians had finally achieved political equality with the patricians. However, the plight of the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in the plight of the average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 48&quot;&gt;Abbott, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supremacy of the New Nobility (287–133 BC)===
The [[Hortensian Law]] deprived the patricians of their last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 63&quot;&gt;Abbott, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 65&quot;&gt;Abbott, 65&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the plebeians were satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 66&quot;&gt;Abbott, 66&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.

In the final decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 77&quot;&gt;Abbott, 77&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 80&quot;&gt;Abbott, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)===
{{see also|Crisis of the Roman Republic}}
The prior era saw great military successes, and great economic failures. The patriotism of the plebeians had kept them from seeking any new reforms. Now, the military situation had stabilised, and fewer soldiers were needed. This, in conjunction with the new slaves that were being imported from abroad, inflamed the unemployment situation further. The flood of unemployed citizens to Rome had made the assemblies quite populist.

====The Gracchi====
{{Main|Gracchi}}
[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|Gaius Gracchus, tribune of the people, presiding over the Plebeian Council]]
[[Tiberius Gracchus]] was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named [[Marcus Octavius]]. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to [[impeach]] Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 96&quot;&gt;Abbott, 96&lt;/ref&gt; His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.

Tiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123 BC. [[Gaius Gracchus|Gaius Gracchus']] ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 97&quot;&gt;Abbott, 97&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, for example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a ''[[Constitution of the Roman Republic#Senate|senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (&quot;ultimate decree of the senate&quot;). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. By this point, however, a part of Rome deserted him. He stood for election to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered. The senate was weakened significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 98&quot;&gt;Abbott, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

====The ''populares'' and the ''optimates''====
[[File:Sulla Coin2.jpg|thumb|A Roman [[denarius]] struck in 56 BC showing on one side the bust of the [[Diana (mythology)|Goddess Diana]], and on the reverse the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] is offered an olive branch by his ally [[Bocchus I]] as the captive [[Jugurtha]] kneels beside Sulla with his hands bound.]]
In 118 BC, King [[Micipsa]] of [[Numidia]] (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was survived by two legitimate sons, [[Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate son, [[Jugurtha]]. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, [[Gaius Marius]], a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 100&quot;&gt;Abbott, 100&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[populares]]'' party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.

Several years later, in 88 BC, a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power, king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Pontus]]. The army, however, was defeated. One of Marius' old quaestors, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the &quot;''[[populares]]''&quot; party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic (&quot;''[[optimates]]''&quot;) party, brought his army back to Italy and [[Sulla's civil wars|marched on Rome]]. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 103&quot;&gt;Abbott, 103&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to his war against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the ''populares'' under Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] soon took control of the city.

During the period in which the ''populares'' party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten year interval between offices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation.

Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical ''popular'' reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 104&quot;&gt;Abbott, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Sulla made himself dictator, passed a [[Constitutional Reforms of Lucius Cornelius Sulla|series of constitutional reforms]], resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul. He died in 78 BC.

====Pompey, Crassus and the Catilinarian Conspiracy====
[[File:Pompeius.JPG|thumb|upright|A Roman marble head of [[Pompey]] (now found in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]])]]
In 77 BC, the senate sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (&quot;Pompey the Great&quot;), to put down an uprising in Spain. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had just put down the [[Spartacus]] led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the ''populares'' party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 108&quot;&gt;Abbott, 108&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to forge an agreement with the ''populares'' party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 109&quot;&gt;Abbott, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 66 BC, a movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 109-110&quot;&gt;Abbott, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 110&quot;&gt;Abbott, 110&lt;/ref&gt; The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome,&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 111&quot;/&gt; and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.

The most important result of the Catilinarian conspiracy was that the ''populares'' party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 111&quot;&gt;Abbott, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Triumvirate====
In 62 BC, Pompey returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from a governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, now known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59 BC, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 112&quot;/&gt;

Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 112&quot;&gt;Abbott, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a bill that gave the populace a free grain dole, which had previously just been subsidised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 113&quot;&gt;Abbott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

====The end of the First Triumvirate====
Clodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by [[Titus Annius Milo]]. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius [[Ahenobarbus]] ran for the consulship in 55 BC promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55 BC, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Crassus led an ill-fated expedition with legions led by his son, Caesar's lieutenant, against the Kingdom of Parthia. This resulted in his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. Finally, Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.

Beginning in the summer of 54 BC, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 114&quot;&gt;Abbott, 114&lt;/ref&gt; This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January of 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 115&quot;&gt;Abbott, 115&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the [[Rubicon]] with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the Senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.

===The period of transition (49–29 BC)===
The era that began when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC and ended when Octavian returned to Rome after Actium in 29 BC, saw the constitutional evolution of the prior century accelerate at a rapid pace. By 29 BC, Rome had completed its transition from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of a world empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 129&quot;&gt;Abbott, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

With Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed. The powers which he would give himself would ultimately be used by his imperial successors.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 134&quot;/&gt; He would assume these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions.

Caesar would hold both the dictatorship and the tribunate, but alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 134&quot;&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 135&quot;&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt; which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abbott, 137&quot;/&gt; This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 138&quot;&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 137&quot;&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caesar's assassination and the Second Triumvirate====
Caesar was assassinated in on March 15, 44 BC. The assassination was led by [[Gaius Cassius]] and [[Marcus Brutus]]. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination.  Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king.  Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes.  Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 133&quot;&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assassination, [[Mark Antony]] formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavian]]. Along with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], they formed an alliance known as the [[Second Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsworthy, p. 237&quot;&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought against each other in one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and he committed suicide with his love, [[Cleopatra]]. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of [[Augustus]]- &quot;Exalted One&quot; .

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Julius Caesar - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Julius Caesar]], from the bust in the [[British Museum]], in ''Cassell's History of England'' (1902).]]

Life in the Roman Republic revolved around the [[city]] of Rome, and its famed [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city also had several [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Mark Wilson ''Principles of Roman Architecture.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], and many taverns, [[Thermae|baths]] and brothels. Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]], and in the capital city of Rome, to the [[House|residences]] on the elegant [[Palatine Hill]], from which the word &quot;''palace''&quot; is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks.

Most Roman towns and cities had a [[Roman Forum|forum]] and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. [[Aqueduct (Roman)|Aqueducts]] brought water to urban centers&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Greene, &quot;&gt;Kevin Greene, &quot;Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I. Finley Re-Considered&quot;, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 53, No. 1. (February , 2000), pp. 29–59 (39)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and left their estates in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves.

Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant,&lt;ref name = &quot;Scott, 404&quot;/&gt; in spite of tirades against the &quot;softening&quot; effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much [[Roman cuisine]] was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style.

===Social history and structure===
{{Main|Social class in ancient Rome}}
Many aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott, 404&quot;&gt;Scott, 404&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture and [[sculpture]], the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the [[arch]] and the [[dome]]. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]]. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies.

The center of the early social structure was the family,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 1&quot;&gt;Abbott, 1&lt;/ref&gt; which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of [[patria potestas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 2&quot;&gt;Abbott, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pater familias]] was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, 6&quot;&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities.

Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were [[History_of_slavery#Rome|slave markets]] where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/slavery_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Resisting Slavery in Ancient Rome|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dl.ket.org/latinlit/mores/slaves/|title=Slavery in Ancient Rome|accessdate=20 June 2008|publisher=Kentucky Educational Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing and dining===
{{Main|Ancient Roman cuisine|Clothing in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Toga Illustration.png|upright|thumb|Roman clad in a [[toga]].]]
Men typically wore a [[toga]], and women a [[stola]]. The woman's ''stola'' differed in looks from a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by [[plebeians]], or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the [[tunic]] worn by [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] was of linen or white wool.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder's [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], book 12 pp. 38&lt;/ref&gt; A knight or magistrate would wear an ''augusticlavus'', a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called ''tunica laticlavia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/culture/ancient-roman-clothing.php |title=Ancient Roman Clothing |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/133 |title=angusti-, angust- + (Latin: narrow, tight, slender, thin) |publisher=Wordinfo.info |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of [[Liberalia]], wore the ''toga praetexta'', which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The ''toga virilis'', (or ''toga pura'') was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The ''toga picta'' was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The ''toga pulla'' was worn when in mourning.

Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots.  The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3181443.stm|title=Romans' crimes of fashion revealed|accessdate=19 June 2008|publisher=BBC | date=26 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans had simple food habits. Staple food was generally consumed at around 11 o'clock, and consisted of bread, salad, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat left over from the dinner the night before. The Roman poet, [[Horace]] mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: &quot;As for me, olives, [[endive]]s, and smooth [[Althaea (genus)|mallows]] provide sustenance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea levesque malvae.&quot; Horace, ''Odes 1.31.15'', ca 30 BC&lt;/ref&gt; The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table. Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups.

Wine was considered a staple drink,&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips pg 46-56&quot;&gt;Phillips pg 46–56&lt;/ref&gt; consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite cheap. [[Cato the Elder]] once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips pg 35-45&quot;&gt;Phillips pg 35–45&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included [[Mark Antony]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips pg 57-63&quot;&gt;Phillipa pg 57–63&lt;/ref&gt; and Cicero's own son Marcus ([[Cicero Minor]]). Even [[Cato the Younger]] was known to be a heavy drinker.

===Education and language===
{{Main|Roman school|Latin}}
Following various military conquests in the [[Greek East]], Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legacy&quot;&gt;The Legacy of Roman Education (in the Forum), Nanette R. Pacal, The Classical Journal, Vol. 79, No. 4. (April  – May 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction&lt;ref name=&quot;Ox&quot;&gt;Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; from their mothers in the art of spinning, weaving, and sewing.
Schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200 BC. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking. [[Rhetoric|Oratory]] was an art to be practiced and learnt, and good orators commanded respect.
[[File:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|right|thumb|The language of Rome has had a profound impact on later cultures, as demonstrated by this manuscript from the Middle Ages.]]

The native language of the Romans was Latin. Although surviving [[Latin literature]] consists almost entirely of [[Classical Latin]], an artificial and highly stylised and polished [[literary language]] from the 1st century BC, the actual spoken language was [[Vulgar Latin]], which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation. Rome's expansion spread Latin throughout Europe, and over time Vulgar Latin evolved and dialectised in different locations, gradually shifting into a number of distinct [[Romance language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&quot;&gt;Palmer (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these languages, including French, Italian, Portuguese, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and Spanish, flourished, the differences between them growing greater over time. Although English is [[Germanic language|Germanic]] rather than Roman in origin, English borrows heavily from Latin and Latin-derived words.

===The arts===
{{Main|Latin literature|Roman art|Music of ancient Rome|Roman architecture}}
Roman literature was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest works we possess are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. [[Virgil]] represents the pinnacle of Roman epic poetry. His ''[[Aeneid]]'' tells the story of flight of Aeneas from [[Troy]] and his settlement of the city that would become Rome. [[Lucretius]], in his ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'', attempted to explicate science in an epic poem. The genre of satire was common in Rome, and satires were written by, among others, [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucilius]] – the acknowledged originator of Roman Satire in the form practiced by Juvenal – experimented with other meters before settling on dactylic hexameter.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Persius]]. The [[rhetoric]]al works of [[Cicero]] are considered to be some of the best bodies of correspondence recorded in antiquity.

In the 3rd century BC, Greek art taken as booty from wars became popular, and many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists. Portrait sculpture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J. M. C. |year=1971 |month=December |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439–442 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period utilised youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. Advancements were also made in relief sculptures, often depicting Roman victories.

Music was a major part of everyday life. The word itself derives from Greek ''μουσική'' (''mousike''), &quot;(art) of the [[Muses]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891|title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.

Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The [[Roman concrete]] has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs &quot;Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained.

===Sports and entertainment===
The city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] (&quot;Field of Mars&quot;), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included [[dice]] (Tesserae or [[Venus Throw|Tali]]), Roman Chess ([[Ludus latrunculorum|Latrunculi]]), Roman [[Draughts|Checkers]] (Calculi), [[Tic-tac-toe]] (Terni Lapilli), and [[Ludus duodecim scriptorum]] and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-roman1&quot;&gt;Austin, Roland G. &quot;Roman Board Games. I&quot;, ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4:10, October 1934. pp. 24–34.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}
Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the [[Roman gods|gods]]. Each household had an altar (''[[lararium]]''), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European pantheon]], others were based on [[Greek gods]]. The two most famous deities were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (the king God) and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]ism and [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Agathias]], ''Histories'', 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{RomanMilitary}}

===Structural history===
{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}
The structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the [[Roman army]] and the [[Roman navy]], although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution.

====Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)====
{{Main|Phalanx formation}}
During this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the [[Etruscans]] to the north,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves seem to have copied [[phalanx formation|their style of warfare]] from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the [[phalanx formation]] into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, [[Servius Tullius]] (ruled 578 to 534 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;''History of Rome'', 1.43&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Antiquities'', 4.16–18&lt;/ref&gt; the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.

One disadvantage of the phalanx was that it was only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the Romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of central [[Italian peninsula]]. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] and placed shortly after the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]] of 390 BC; it is more likely, however, that they were copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south,&lt;ref&gt;''Early Roman Armies'', pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]] (326 to 304 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manipular legion (c. 315–107 BC)====
During this period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) was known as a legion. The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. The maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three [[heavy infantry]] types.

Each first line maniple were leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;in) in height and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears. The second infantry line was armed and armoured in the same manner as was the first infantry line. The second infantry line, however, wore a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate. The third infantry line was the last remnant of the hoplite-style (the Greek-style formation used occasionally during the early Republic) troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as were the soldiers in the second line, with the exception that they carried a lighter spear.&lt;ref name=&quot;polybiusB6&quot;&gt;PolybiusB6&lt;/ref&gt;

The three infantry classes&lt;ref name=&quot;santosuossoP18&quot;&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.

The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.&lt;ref name=&quot;santosuossoP18&quot;&gt;santosuossoP18&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.

Rome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the [[Socii]], such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in ''alae'', or ''wings'', roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300. 

A small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300 BC, but it was massively upgraded about forty years later, during the [[First Punic War]]. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] (&quot;Punic&quot;) pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;websterP156&quot;&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 217 BC, near the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]], Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabbaP9&quot;&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it had not had to do in the past.

The distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

====The legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)====
[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Gaius Marius]], instigator of the [[Marian reforms]].]]
In a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], Roman consul [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantosuossoP29&quot;&gt;SantosuossoP29&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat &quot;acquired a stronger and more elevated position&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gabbaP25&quot;&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; within the state.

The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier ''maniple'' sub-unit, and was divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuries]] of 80 men each.&lt;ref name=&quot;luttwakP14&quot;&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Each century was separated further into 10 &quot;tent groups&quot; of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;luttwakP15&quot;&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.

After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], an invasion fleet was assembled in the [[English Channel]] to allow the invasion of ''[[Britannia]]''; under [[Pompey]], a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of [[Cilicia]]n pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;websterP156&quot;&gt;websterP156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign history===
{{Main|Campaign history of the Roman military}}
The core of the campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the [[Roman military]]'s land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome.

As with most ancient civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive,&lt;ref name=&quot;luttwakP38&quot;&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century.

Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans &quot;''produced their share of incompetents''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of even the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]],&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; to win the battle but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses.

====Early Republic (458–274 BC)====

=====Early Italian campaigns (458–396 BC)=====
The first Roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either [[Latins|Latin]] towns and villages,&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB1C11&quot;&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman History'', Book 1, ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt; or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP38&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Rome defeated Latin cities in the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 496 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB1C11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP37&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 37 See also: Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Mons Algidus]] in 458 BC, the [[Battle of Corbione]] in 446 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''The Roman History'', Vol. 1, VII, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP13&quot;&gt;''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Aricia]],&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; and an Etruscan city in the [[Battle of the Cremera]] in 477 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB1C12&quot;&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman History'', Book 1, ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt; {{Campaignbox Rome's Early Italian Campaigns}}By the end of this period, Rome had effectively [[Roman conquest of Italy|completed the conquest]] of their immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. II&lt;/ref&gt; as well as secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the tribespeople of the nearby Apennine hills.

=====Celtic invasion of Italia (390–387 BC)=====
{{See also|Roman Republican governors of Gaul}}
{{Campaignbox Roman-Gallic Wars}}
By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted of this when a particularly warlike tribe&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman History'', Book 1, ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt; invaded two Etruscan towns from the north. These two towns were not far from Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]] around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and sacked the city&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', p. 329 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; before being either driven off or bought off. Now that the Romans and Gauls had bloodied one another, intermittent warfare was to continue between the two in Italy for more than two centuries. The Celtic problem would not be resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul by Julius Caesar at the [[Battle of Alesia]] in 52 BC.

=====Roman expansion into Italia (343–282 BC)=====
[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Map showing Roman expansion in Italy.]]
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}
After recovering surprisingly swiftly from the sack of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rme'', Ch. IX, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt; the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The [[First Samnite War]] of between 343 BC and 341 BC was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in two battles, but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the [[Latin War]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pennellC9P13&quot;&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. IX, para. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Rome bested the Latins in the [[Battle of Vesuvius]] and again in the [[Battle of Trifanum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pennellC9P13&quot;/&gt; after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 49 See also: Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. IX, para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Samnite War]], from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much longer and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyOfRomeP52&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. The Romans then proved victorious at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.

Seven years after their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the [[Third Samnite War]]. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 BC Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

=====Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC)=====
[[File:Pyrrhus route.jpg|thumb|300px|Route of Pyrrhus of Epirus]]
{{Campaignbox Pyrrhic War}}
By the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself as a major power on the [[Italian Peninsula]], but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] at the time: [[Carthage]] and the Greek kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP14&quot;&gt;Matyszak''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historyOrRomeP78&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

When a diplomatic dispute between Rome and a Greek colony&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; erupted into open warfare in a naval confrontation, the Greek colony appealed for military aid to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], ruler of the northwestern Greek kingdom of [[Epirus]]. Motivated by a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men on Italian soil in 280 BC.

Despite early victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''The Roman history'', Vol. 1, VIII, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula (thus deriving the term &quot;[[pyrrhic victory]]&quot;). In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced, by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.

The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have a great effect on Rome. Rome had shown it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing the Greek colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Now, Rome effectively dominated the Italian peninsula,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XI, para. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and won an international military reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-Republic (274–148 BC)====

=====Punic Wars (264–146 BC)=====
[[File:Map of Rome and Carthage at the start of the Second Punic War.svg|thumb|300px|left|Theatre of Punic Wars]]
{{Campaignbox First Punic War}}
{{Campaignbox Second Punic War}}
{{Campaignbox Third Punic War}}
The [[First Punic War]] began in 264 BC when settlements on Sicily began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay – Rome and Carthage – to solve internal conflicts. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. Before the First Punic War there was no Roman navy to speak of. The new war in [[Sicily]] against [[Carthage]], a great naval power,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XII, para. 14&lt;/ref&gt; forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few naval battles were catastrophic disasters for Rome. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; a Roman naval force was able to defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval victories followed.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians then hired [[Xanthippus of Carthage]], a Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy. With their newfound naval abilities, the Romans then beat the Carthaginians in naval battle again at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] and leaving Carthage without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise one. For a maritime power the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace.

Continuing distrust led to the renewal of hostilities in the [[Second Punic War]] when [[Hannibal Barca]] attacked a Spanish town,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 29 See also: Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which had diplomatic ties to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XIII, para. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal then crossed the Italian Alps to invade Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;antiquityP153&quot;&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 153 See also: Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal's successes in Italy began immediately, and reached an early climax at the [[Battle of Cannae]], where 70,000 Romans were killed.

In three battles, the Romans managed to hold off Hannibal but then Hannibal smashed a succession of Roman consular armies. By this time Hannibal's brother [[Hasdrubal Barca]] sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively on the [[Battle of the Metaurus|Metaurus River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;antiquityP153&quot;/&gt; Unable to defeat Hannibal himself on Italian soil, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa under [[Scipio Africanus]] with the intention of threatening the Carthaginian capital. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, and defeated at the [[Battle of Zama]].

Carthage never managed to recover after the Second Punic War&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XV, para. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Third Punic War]] that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered immediate surrender, conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;punicP339&quot;&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans refused the surrender, and the city was stormed after a short siege and completely destroyed. Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Spanish territories were acquired by Rome.

Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] of the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], located in the north of the [[Greek peninsula]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP47&quot;&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP115&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP47&quot;/&gt; The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.

Macedonia began to encroach on territory claimed by Greek city states in 200 BC and these states pleaded for help from their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit several parts of Greater Macedonia to Rome and give up his designs on Greece. Philip refused, and Rome declared war starting the [[Second Macedonian War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP49&quot;&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 197 BC, the Romans decisevely defeated Philip at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently Macedonia was reduced to a central rump state.

Rome now turned its attentions to one of the Greek kingdoms, the [[Seleucid Empire]], in the east. A Roman force defeated the Seleucids at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae]] and forced them to evacuate Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP119&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them in the decisive engagement of the [[Battle of Magnesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

In 179 BC, Philip died&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP120&quot;&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; and his talented and ambitious son, Perseus, took his throne and showed a renewed interest in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the [[Third Macedonian War]]. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by simply sending another stronger army. The second consular army decisevely defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;historyP120&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the [[Third Macedonian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Macedonia was then divided by the Romans into four client republics.

The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was attempting to re-establish the old Kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]]. The [[Achaean League]] chose this moment to rebel against Roman domination but was swiftly defeated. [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] was besieged and destroyed in 146 BC, the same year as the destruction of [[Carthage]], which led to the  league's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;History of Rome – The republic, Isaac Asimov.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Republic (147–30 BC)====

=====Jugurthine War (111–104 BC)=====
{{Campaignbox Jugurthine War}}
The [[Jugurthine War]] of 111–104 BC was fought between Rome and [[Jugurtha]] of the North African kingdom of [[Numidia]]. It constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;stormingP29&quot;&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''The Jugurthine War'', XII&lt;/ref&gt; a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.

=====The Celtic threat (121 BC) and the new Germanic threat (113–101 BC)=====
{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}
In 121 BC, Rome came into contact with two Celtic tribes (from a region in modern France), both of which they defeated with apparent ease. The [[Cimbrian War]] (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the ''[[Cimbri]]'' and the ''[[Teutons]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;appianS6&quot;&gt;Appian, ''History of Rome'', §6&lt;/ref&gt; migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories,&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP75&quot;&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and clashed with Rome and her allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormingP6&quot;&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.

=====Internal unrest (135–71 BC)=====
{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
The extensive campaigning abroad by Roman generals, and the rewarding of soldiers with plunder on these campaigns, led to a general trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their generals rather than to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Rome was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because vast tracts of land had been given over to slave farming in which the slaves greatly outnumbered their Roman masters. In the last century BC at least twelve [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later ''[[Caesar Augustus]]'') ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made ''[[princeps]]'' (emperor).

Between 135 BC and 71 BC there were three [[Roman Servile Wars|&quot;Servile Wars&quot;]] involving slave uprisings against the Roman state.  The [[Third Servile War|third]] and final uprising was the most serious,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; involving ultimately between 120,000&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars, 1, 117&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; slaves under the command of the gladiator [[Spartacus]]. Additionally, in 91 BC the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy over dissent among the allies that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.

The internal unrest reached its most serious state, however, in the [[Sulla's civil wars|two civil wars]] that were caused by the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] at the beginning of 82 BC. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]]&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman Senate and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

=====Conflicts with Mithridates (89–63 BC) and the Cilician pirates (67 BC)=====
{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Second Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Third Mithridatic War}}
[[Mithridates the Great]] was the ruler of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB3C5&quot;&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a large kingdom in [[Asia Minor]] (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63 BC. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB3C5&quot;/&gt; and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring.&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB3C5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In 88 BC, Mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000 Romans living in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the [[First Mithridatic War]]. The Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, [[Gaius Marius]]. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.

The [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex a province that Mithridates claimed as his own. In the [[Third Mithridatic War]], first [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then [[Pompey the Great]] were sent against Mithridates.&lt;ref name=&quot;classicalworldP363&quot;&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time [[Battle of the Lycus]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Plutarch&quot;&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Pompey&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}
The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,&lt;ref name = &quot;Plutarch&quot;/&gt; largely from [[Cilicia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epitomeB3C6&quot;&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. [[Pompey]] was nominated as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;classicalworldP363&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Plutarch&quot;/&gt; It took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy.

=====Caesar's early campaigns (59–50 BC)=====
[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|left|thumb|300px|Map of the Gallic Wars]]
{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}
During a term as praetor in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary [[Julius Caesar]] defeated two local tribes in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;livescaesar&quot;&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Caesar&lt;/ref&gt; Following his term as consul in 59 BC, he was then appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (the modern Balkans).&lt;ref name=&quot;livescaesar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul, which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.

Caesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 BC and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|two expeditions into Britain]], becoming the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the [[Battle of Alesia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;stormingP62&quot;&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 62 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, the entirety of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and, other than the crisis of the 3rd century, remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the western empire in 476.

=====Triumvirates and Caesarian ascension (53–30 BC)=====
{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}
By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]] was formed between [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (&quot;Pompey the Great&quot;) to share power and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes,&lt;ref name=&quot;enemiesP133&quot;&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; he marched his army deep into the desert;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.

By the spring of 49 BC, the hardened legions of Caesar crossed the river [[Rubicon]] and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Iberia (modern Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Civil War'', 81–92 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 227 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.

Pompey's death did not result in an end to the civil war as Caesar's enemies were manifold and continued to fight on. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the [[Battle of Munda]].

Caesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers and his enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger a group of senators hatched a conspiracy and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered Caesar]] in the Senate in March 44 BC.
&lt;ref name=&quot;antiquityP170&quot;&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mark Antony]], Caesar's lieutenant, condemned Caesar's assassination, and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Caesar's adopted son and chosen heir, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavian]], was entrusted with the command of the war against him. At the [[Battle of Mutina]] Antony was defeated by the consuls [[Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]], who were both killed.

Octavian came to terms with Caesarians Antony and Lepidus in 43 BC when the [[Second Triumvirate]] was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsworthy, p. 237&quot;/&gt; In 42 BC [[Triumvir]]s [[Mark Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]] fought the [[Battle of Philippi]] with Caesar's assassins [[Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus joined him shortly afterwards.

However, civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and [[Mark Antony]] failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;antiquityP170&quot;/&gt; At the naval [[Battle of Actium]] off the coast of Greece, [[Augustus|Octavian]] decisively defeated Antony and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]]. Octavian was granted a series of special powers including sole &quot;imperium&quot; within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 BC Octavian was granted the use of the names &quot;Augustus&quot; and &quot;Princeps&quot; indicating his primary status above all other Romans, and he adopted the title &quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; making him the first Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;grandP7&quot;&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
