{{History of war}}

'''Medieval warfare''' is the [[warfare]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. In [[Europe]], technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], changing military [[military tactics|tactics]] and the role of [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]]. In terms of fortification, the Middle Ages saw the emergence of the [[castle]] in Europe, which then spread to [[southwestern Asia]].

==Strategy and tactics==
===''De re militari''===
{{Quote box | quote=''si vis pacem, para bellum''&lt;br /&gt;If you want peace, prepare for war|source = Vegetius, ''De re militari, preface to book 3.&lt;ref&gt;Milner (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right}}
[[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]], Vegetius for short, wrote ''[[De Re Militari|De re militari]]'' possibly in the late 4th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; Described by historian [[Walter Goffart]] as &quot;the bible of warfare throughout the Middle Ages&quot;, ''De re militari'' was widely distributed through the Latin West. While [[western Europe]] relied on a single text for the basis of its military knowledge, the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[southeastern Europe]] had a succession of military writers.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart (1977), p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vegetius had no military experience, and ''De re militari'' was derived from the works of [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and [[Frontinus]], his books were the standard for military discourse in western Europe from their production until the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;13&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; ''De re militari'' was divided into four books: who should be a soldier and the skills they needed to learn; the composition and structure of an [[army]]; field tactics; how to conduct and withstand [[siege]]s, and the role of the [[navy]].  According to Vegetius, [[infantry]] was the most important element of an army because it was cheap compared to [[cavalry]] and could be deployed on any terrain.&lt;ref name=Nicholson14&gt;Nicholson (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tenets he put forward was that a general should only engage in battle when he was sure of victory or had no other choice.&lt;ref&gt;Gillingham (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; As archaeologist Robert Liddiard explains &quot;[[Pitched battle]]s, particularly in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, were rare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Liddiard (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;79&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his work was widely reproduced, and over 200 copies, translations, and extracts survive today, the extent to which Vegetius affected the actual practice of warfare as opposed to its concept is unclear due to his habit of stating the obvious.&lt;ref name=Nicholson14/&gt; Historian [[Michael Clanchy]] noted &quot;the medieval axiom that laymen are illiterate and its converse that clergy are literate&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholson (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt; so it may be the case that few soldiers read Vegetius' work. While their Roman predecessors were well-educated and had been experienced in warfare, the European nobility of the early medieval period were not renowned for their education, however from the 12th&amp;nbsp;century it became more common for them to read.  Some soldiers regarded experience of warfare as more valuable than reading about it; for example, [[Geoffroi de Charney]], a 14th&amp;nbsp;century knight who wrote about warfare, recommended that his audience should learn by observing and asking advice from their superiors. While it is uncertain to what extent his work was read amongst the warrior class as opposed to the clergy, Vegetius remained prominent in the literature on warfare in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1489 King [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VII of England]] commissioned the translation of ''De re militari'' into English &quot;so every gentleman born to arms and all manner of men of war, captains, soldiers, vituallers and all others would know how they ought to behave in the feats of wars and battles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholson (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment of force===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
[[File:Musee-de-lArmee-IMG 1076.jpg|thumb|Knight's full plate armour, [[Musée de l'Armée]], [[Paris]]]]

The experience level and tactical maneuvering ability of medieval armies varied depending on the period and region.  For larger battles, pre-battle planning typically consisted of a council of the war leaders, which could either be the general laying down a plan or a noisy debate between the different leaders, depending on how much authority the general possessed. Battlefield communications before the advent of strict lines of communication were naturally very difficult. Communication was done through musical signals, audible commands, messengers, or visual signals such as raising a standard banner or flag.

The infantry, including missile troops (such as [[archery|archer]]s), would typically be employed at the outset of the battle to break open infantry formations while the [[cavalry]] attempted to defeat its opposing number. If the cavalry met foot soldiers, the [[pikemen]] would engage them. Perhaps the most important technological advancement for medieval warfare in Europe was the invention of the [[stirrup]]. It most likely came to Europe with the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] in the 7th century, although it was not properly adopted by the major European powers until the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalwarfare.org MedievalWarfare.org], ''Medieval Warfare in Europe'',&lt;/ref&gt;

Once one side coaxed their opposing infantry into breaking formation, the cavalry would be deployed in an attempt to exploit the loss of cohesion in the opposing infantry lines and begin slaying the infantrymen in the pandemonium. Once a break in the lines was exploited, the cavalry became instrumental to victory, causing further breakage in the lines and wreaking havoc amongst the infantrymen, as it is much easier to kill a man from the top of a horse than to stand on the ground and face a half-ton [[destrier]] (large warhorse) carrying an armed knight. However, until a significant break in the enemy infantry lines arose, the cavalry could not be used to much effect against infantry since horses are not easily harried into a wall of pikemen. Pure infantry conflicts could be lengthy and drawn-out.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Muzzleloader|Muzzle-loaded]] [[cannon]]s were introduced to the battlefield in the later medieval period. However, their very poor rate of fire (which often meant that only one shot was fired in the course of an entire battle){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and their inaccuracy made them more of a psychological force multiplier than an effective anti-personnel weapon. Later on in medieval warfare, once [[hand cannon]]s were introduced, the rate of fire improved only slightly, but the cannons became far easier to aim, largely because they were smaller and much closer to their wielder. Their users could be easily protected, because the cannons were lighter and could be moved far more quickly.

A hasty retreat could cause greater casualties than an organized withdrawal, because the fast cavalry of the winning side's rearguard would intercept the fleeing enemy while their infantry continued their attack {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. In most medieval battles, more soldiers were killed during the retreat than in battle, since mounted [[knight]]s could quickly and easily dispatch the archers and infantry who were no longer protected by a line of [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s as they had been during the previous fighting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Fortifications==
[[File:Falaise chateau guillaume conquerant 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Falaise]] in France]]

Breakdowns in centralized states led to the rise of a number of groups that turned to large-scale pillage as a source of income. Most notably the [[Vikings]] (but also [[Arabs]], [[Mongols]] and [[Magyars]]) raided significantly. As these groups were generally small and needed to move quickly, building [[fortifications]] was a good way to provide refuge and protection for the people and the wealth in the region.

These fortifications evolved over the course of the Middle Ages, the most important form being the [[castle]], a structure which has become linked with the medieval era to many. The castle served as a protected place for the local elites. Inside a castle they were protected from bands of raiders and could send mounted warriors to drive the raiders from the area, or to disrupt the efforts of larger armies to supply themselves in the region by gaining local superiority over foraging parties that would be impossible against the whole enemy host.

Fortifications were a very important part of warfare because they provided safety to the lord, his family, and his servants. They provided refuge from armies too large to face in open battle. The ability of the heavy cavalry to dominate a battle on an open field was useless against fortifications. Building [[siege engine]]s was a time-consuming process, and could seldom be effectively done without preparations before the campaign. Many sieges could take months, if not years, to weaken or demoralize the defenders sufficiently. Fortifications were an excellent means of ensuring that the elite could not be easily dislodged from their lands - as [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut|Count Baldwin of Hainaut]] commented in 1184 on seeing enemy troops ravage his lands from the safety of his castle, &quot;they can't take the land with them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = McGlynn  | first = Sean  | title = The Myths of Medieval Warfare  | journal = History Today  | volume = 44  | issue = 1  | pages = 32  | date = Jan. 1994  | url = http://web.ebscohost.com   | issn = 0018-2753  | accessdate = September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=September 2009}}

===Siege warfare===
In the Medieval period besieging armies used a wide variety of [[siege engine]]s including: scaling ladders; [[battering ram]]s; [[siege tower]]s and various types of [[catapult]]s such as the [[mangonel]], [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]], [[ballista]], and [[trebuchet]]. Siege techniques also included [[mining (military)|mining]] in which tunnels were dug under a section of the wall and then rapidly collapsed to destabilize the wall's foundation.  A final technique was to bore into the enemy walls, however this was not nearly as effective as other methods due to the thickness of castle walls. Several of these siege techniques were used by the Romans but experienced a rebirth during the Crusades.

[[File:Forteresse de Dubrovnik.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The [[Walls of Dubrovnik]] are a series of [[defensive wall|defensive stone walls]], never breached by hostile army, that have surrounded and protected a maritime [[city-state]] of [[Dubrovnik]] ([[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]), situated in southern [[Croatia]].]]

Advances in the prosecution of [[siege]]s encouraged the development of a variety of defensive counter-measures. In particular, [[medieval fortification]]s became progressively stronger — for example, the advent of the [[concentric castle]] from the period of the [[Crusades]] — and more dangerous to attackers — witness the increasing use of [[machicolation]]s and [[murder-hole]]s, as well the preparation of [[Early thermal weapons|hot or incendiary substances]]. [[Arrow slit]]s, concealed doors for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral to resisting siege at this time. Designers of castles paid particular attention to defending entrances, protecting gates with [[drawbridge]]s, [[portcullis]]es  and [[barbican]]s. Wet animal skins were often draped over gates to repel fire. [[Moat]]s and other water defenses, whether natural or augmented, were also vital to defenders.

In the [[Middle Ages]], virtually all large cities had [[city wall]]s — [[Dubrovnik]] in [[Dalmatia]] is an impressive and well-preserved example — and more important cities had [[citadel]]s, [[fort]]s or [[castle]]s. Great effort was expended to ensure a good water supply inside the city in case of siege. In some cases, long tunnels were constructed to carry water into the city. In other cases, such as the Ottoman [[siege of Shkodra]], Venetian engineers had designed and installed cisterns that were fed by rain water channeled by a system of conduits in the walls and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Karaiskaj, Gjerak. “Furnizimi me ujë i kalasë së Shkodrës ne mesjetë.” ''Monumentet: Materialet e sesionit III shkencor të Institutit të Monumenteve të Kulturës'' 11 (1985): 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex systems of underground tunnels were used for storage and communications in medieval cities like [[Tábor]] in [[Bohemia]]. Against these would be matched the [[mining]] skills of teams of trained [[sapper]]s, who were sometimes employed by besieging armies.

Until the invention of [[gunpowder]]-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the invention of gunpowder, the traditional methods of defense became less and less effective against a determined siege.

==Organization==
{{Main|Knight|Infantry in the Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Heavy cavalry|Light cavalry}}
The medieval knight was usually a mounted and armoured [[soldier]], often connected with [[nobility]] or [[royal family|royalty]], although (especially in north-eastern Europe) knights could also come from the lower classes, and could even be unfree persons. The cost of their [[armor]], [[Horses in the Middle Ages|horses]], and [[weapons]] was great; this, among other things, helped gradually transform the knight, at least in western Europe, into a distinct social class separate from other warriors. During the [[crusades]], holy orders of Knights fought in the Holy Land (see [[Knights Templar]], the [[Hospitallers]], etc.).

Heavily armed cavalry, armed with [[lances]] and a varied assortment of [[hand weapons]] played a significant part in the battles of the Middle Ages. The heavy cavalry consisted of wealthy knights and noblemen who could afford the equipment and non-noble squires employed by noblemen. Heavy cavalry was the difference between victory and defeat in many key battles. Their thunderous charges could break the lines of most infantry formations, making them a valuable asset to all medieval armies.

[[File:Kalandozasok.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hungarian raids in the 10th century. Most European nations were praying for mercy: &quot;Sagittis hungarorum libera nos Domine&quot; - &quot;Lord save us from the arrows of Hungarians&quot;]]
Light cavalry consisted usually of lighter armed and armoured men, who could have lances, [[javelin]]s or missile weapons, such as [[bow (weapon)|bows]] or [[crossbow]]s. In the Dark Ages and much of the Middle Ages light cavalry usually consisted of wealthy commoners. Later in the Middle Ages light cavalry would also include sergeants who were men who had trained as knights but could not afford the costs associated with the title. Light cavalry were used as scouts, skirmishers or outflankers. Many countries developed their own styles of light cavalry, such as Hungarian mounted archers, Spanish [[jinete]]s, Italian and German mounted crossbowmen and English currours.

Infantry were recruited and trained in a wide variety of manners in different regions of Europe all through the Middle Ages, and probably always formed the most numerous part of a medieval field army. Many infantrymen in prolonged wars would be mercenaries. Most armies contained significant numbers of spearmen, archers and other unmounted soldiers. In sieges, perhaps the most common element of medieval warfare,{{Citation needed|reason=undated|date=August 2010}} infantry units served as garrison troops and archers, among other positions. Near the end of the Middle Ages, with the advancements of weapons and armour, the infantryman became more important to an army.{{Citation needed|reason=undated|date=August 2010}}

===Recruiting===
In the earliest Middle Ages it was the obligation of every noble to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry.  This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would typically be. Typically the feudal armies consisted of a core of highly skilled knights and their household troops, mercenaries hired for the time of the campaign and feudal levies fulfilling their feudal obligations, who usually were little more than rabble. They could, however, be efficient in disadvantageous terrain. Towns and cities could also field militias.

As central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen and mercenary armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the peasantry began to be the central recruiting tool. It was estimated that the best [[infantrymen]] came from the younger sons of free land-owning [[yeoman|yeomen]], such as the English archers and Swiss pikemen. England was one of the most centralized states in the Late Middle Ages, and the armies that fought the [[Hundred Years' War]] were mostly paid professionals. In theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent. Thus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large mercenary market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.

As the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on [[mercenaries]] to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them problematic; while at war they were considerably more reliable than a standing army, at peacetime they proved a risk to the state itself like the [[Praetorian Guard]] had once been. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on manoeuvre as on battles, since the [[condottieri]] recognized it was more efficient to attack the enemy's ability to wage war rather than his battle forces, discovering the concept of [[indirect approach|indirect warfare]] 500 years before Sir Basil [[Liddell Hart]], and attempting to attack the enemy supply lines, his economy and his ability to wage war rather than risking an open battle, and manoeuvre him into a position where risking a battle would have been suicidial. Macchiavelli misunderstood the [[indirect approach]] as cowardice.

The knights were drawn to battle by feudal and social obligation, and also by the prospect of profit and advancement. Those who performed well were likely to increase their landholdings and advance in the social hierarchy. The prospect of significant income from pillage and ransoming prisoners was also important. For the mounted knight Medieval Warfare could be a relatively low risk affair. Nobles avoided killing each other, rather preferring capturing them alive, for several reasons—for one thing, many were related to each other, had   fought alongside one another, and they were all (more or less) members of the same elite culture; for another, a noble's [[ransom]] could be very high, and indeed some made a living by capturing and ransoming nobles in battle. Even peasants, who did not share the bonds of kinship and culture, would often avoid killing a nobleman, valuing the high ransom that a live capture could bring, as well as the valuable horse, armour and equipment that came with him. However, this is by no means a rule of medieval warfare. It was quite common, even at the height of &quot;chivalric&quot; warfare, for the knights to suffer heavy casualties during battles.

==Relics==
The practice of carrying [[relic]]s into battle is a feature that distinguishes medieval warfare from its predecessors or from early modern warfare. The presence of relics was believed to be an important source of supernatural power that served both as a spiritual weapon and a form of defense; the relics of martyrs were considered by Saint [[John Chrysostom]] much more powerful than &quot;walls, trenches, weapons and hosts of soldiers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Chrysostom, ''Laudatio martyrum Aegyptiorum'', 1 ''PG'' '''50''' col. 694f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the ''[[carroccio]]'' or ''carro della guerra'', the &quot;war wagon&quot;, was an elaboration of this practice that developed during the 13th century. The ''carro della guerra'' of Milan was described in detail in 1288 by [[Bonvesin de la Riva]] in his book on the &quot;Marvels of Milan&quot;. Wrapped in scarlet cloth and drawn by three yoke of oxen that were [[caparison]]ed in white with the red cross of [[Saint George]], the city's patron, it carried a crucifix so massive it took four men to step it in place, like a ship's mast.&lt;ref&gt;Bovesin de la Riva, ''De Magnalibus Mediolani: Meraviglie di Milano'' (Milan, 1998), as reported in John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and Their Food'' (New York, 2008), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplies and logistics==
As [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] famously said, &quot;an army marches on its stomach&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;George B. Bryan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryan|first1=George B. |last2=Mieder|first2=Wolfgang |title=The Proverbial Bernard Shaw: An Index to Proverbs in the Works of George Bernard Shaw (Bibliographies &amp; Indexes in World Literature) |edition=1st|date=20 January 1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-29218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weakness that has applied to all military campaigns in history. Medieval armies were supplied much as earlier armies had been. With the advent of castle-building and the extended siege, supply problems had to be solved on a scale seldom seen before, as armies had to stay in one spot for months, or even years.

===Plunder and foraging===
The usual method for solving logistical problems for smaller armies was foraging or &quot;living off the land&quot;. As medieval campaigns were often directed at well-populated settled areas, a travelling army would forcibly commandeer all available resources from the land they passed through, from food to raw materials to equipment. Living off the land is not very easy when there is no food ready to eat, so there was, in theory at least, a prescribed &quot;campaign season&quot; that aimed to conduct warfare at a predictable time, when there would be both food on the ground and relatively good weather. This season was usually from spring to autumn, as by early spring all the crops would be planted, thus freeing the male population for warfare until they were needed for harvest time in late-autumn. As an example, in many European countries serfs and peasants were obliged to perform around 45 days of military service per year without pay, usually during this campaign season when they were not required for [[agriculture]].

Plunder in itself was often the objective of a military campaign, to either pay mercenary forces, seize resources, reduce the fighting capacity of enemy forces, or as a calculated insult to the enemy ruler. Examples are the Viking attacks across Europe, or the highly destructive English [[chevauchée]]s across northern France during the [[Hundred Years' War]].

===Supply trains===
Supply trains are as much a feature of Medieval warfare as they are of ancient and modern warfare. Due to the impossibility of maintaining a real front in premodern warfare, the supplies had to be carried with the army and/or transported to it while under guard. However, a supply source moving with the army was necessary for any large-scale army to operate. Medieval supply trains are often found in illuminations and even poems of the period.

River and sea travel proved to be the easiest ways to transport supplies. During his invasion of the [[Levant]], [[Richard I of England]] was forced to supply his army as it was marching through a barren desert. By marching his army along the shore, Richard was regularly resupplied by ships travelling along the coast. Likewise, as in [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] times, armies would frequently follow rivers while their supplies were being carried by barges. Supplying armies by mass land-transport would not become practical until the invention of [[rail transport]] and the [[internal combustion engine]].

The baggage train provided an alternative supply method that was not dependent on access to a water-way. However, it was often a tactical liability. Supply chains forced armies to travel more slowly than a light skirmishing force and were typically centrally placed in the army, protected by the infantry and outriders. Attacks on an enemy's baggage when it was unprotected — as for instance the French attack on the English train at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], highlighted in the play [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]—could cripple an army's ability to continue a campaign. This was particularly true in the case of sieges, when large amounts of supplies had to be provided for the besieging army. To refill its supply train, an army would forage extensively as well as resupply itself in cities or supply points - border castles were frequently stocked with supplies for this purpose.

===Famine and disease===
{{Main|Medieval demography}}
A failure in logistics often resulted in [[famine]] and [[disease]] for the medieval world, with corresponding deaths and loss of [[morale]]. A besieging force could starve while waiting for the same to happen to the besieged, which meant the siege had to be lifted. With the advent of the great castles of high medieval Europe however, this problem was typically something commanders prepared for on both sides, so sieges could be long, drawn-out affairs.

Epidemics of diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], and [[dysentery]] often swept through medieval armies, especially when poorly supplied or sedentary. In a famous example, in 1347 the [[bubonic plague]] erupted in the besieging [[Mongol]] army outside the walls of [[Caffa]], [[Crimea]] where the disease then spread throughout Europe as the [[Black Death]].

For the inhabitants of a contested area, famine often followed protracted periods of warfare, because foraging armies ate any food stores they could find, reducing or depleting reserve stores. In addition, the overland routes taken by armies on the move could easily destroy a carefully planted field, preventing a crop the following season. Moreover, the death toll in war hit the farming labour pool particularly hard, making it even more difficult to recoup losses.

==Naval warfare==
{{Main|Naval warfare}}
{{See also|Byzantine navy}}
[[File:Gokstad Ship Side View.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Gokstad ship]] at the [[Viking Ship Museum (Oslo)|Viking Ship Museum]]]]
The waters surrounding Europe can be grouped into two types which affected the design of craft that travelled and therefore the warfare. The [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]s were free of tides, generally calm, and the weather predictable. The seas around the north and west of Europe experienced stronger and less predictable weather. The [[weather gage]], the advantage of having a following wind, was an important factor in naval battles, particularly to the attackers. Typically [[westerlies]] (winds blowing from west to east) dominated Europe, giving naval powers to the west an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;231&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval sources on the conduct of medieval naval warfare are less common than those about land-based war. Most medieval chroniclers had no experience of life on the sea, and generally were not well-informed. [[Marine archaeology]] has helped provide information.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;230–231&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the medieval period, ships in the context of warfare were used primarily for transporting troops.&lt;ref&gt;DeVries (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;283&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mediterranean, naval warfare in the medieval period resembled that of the ancient period: fleets of [[galley]]s would exchange missile fire and then come alongside for [[marine (military)|marines]] to fight on deck. This mode of naval warfare continued even into the early modern period, as, for example, at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]]. Famous admirals included [[Andrea Doria]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], and [[Don John of Austria]]. However, galleys were fragile and difficult to use in the cold and turbulent [[North Sea]] and northern Atlantic, although they saw occasional use. Bulkier ships were developed which were primarily [[sail]]-driven, although the long lowboard Viking-style rowed [[longship]] saw use well into the 15th century. Ramming was impractical with these sailing ships, but their main purpose remained the transportation of soldiers to fight on the decks of the opposing ship (as, for example, at the [[Battle of Svolder]] or the [[Battle of Sluys]]).

[[Image:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|250 px|The [[Battle of Sluys]], 1340, from [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'']]
Warships resembled floating fortresses, with towers in the [[bow (boat)|bow]]s and at the [[stern]] (respectively, the [[forecastle]] and [[aftcastle]]).  The large superstructure made these warships quite unstable, but the decisive defeats the more mobile but considerably lower boarded longships suffered at the hands of high-boarded cogs in the 15th century ended the issue of which ship type would dominate northern European warfare.

In the medieval period, it had proved difficult to mount cannons on board a warship, although some were placed in the fore- and aftcastles. Small hand-held anti-personnel cannons were used, but large cannons mounted on deck further compromised the stability of warships, and cannons at that time had a slow rate of fire and were inaccurate. All this was about to change at the end of the medieval period. The insertion of an opening in the side of a ship, with a hinged cover, allowed the creation of a [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|gundeck]] below the main deck. The weight of cannon distributed to lower decks of the ship increased its stability immensely, effectively providing [[Sailing ballast|ballast]], and a row of cannon on a lower deck produced the [[broadside]], where the weight of shot overcame the inherent inaccuracy of firing cannons from a ship at sea. An example is the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', the flagship of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]'s fleet, which had around eleven heavy guns per side, all of which were capable of firing shot nine pounds or more.

==Rise of infantry==
{{Main|Infantry in the Middle Ages}}
In the Medieval period, the mounted cavalry long held sway on the battlefield. Heavily armoured, mounted knights represented a formidable foe for reluctant peasant draftees and lightly armoured freemen. To defeat mounted cavalry, infantry used swarms of missiles or a tightly packed phalanx of men, techniques honed in Antiquity by the Greeks. The ancient generals of Asia used regiments of archers to fend off mounted threats.  Alexander the Great combined both methods in his clashes with swarming Asiatic horseman, screening the central infantry core with slingers, archers and javelin men, before unleashing his cavalry to see off attackers.

===Swiss pikemen===
The use of long pikes and densely packed foot troops was not uncommon in the Middle Ages. The [[Flemings|Flemish]] footmen at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] met and overcame French knights in 1302, and the  Scots held their own against heavily armored English invaders. During the St.Louis crusade, dismounted French knights formed a tight lance-and-shield phalanx to repel Egyptian cavalry. The Swiss used pike tactics in the late medieval period. While pikemen usually grouped together and awaited a mounted attack, the Swiss developed flexible formations and aggressive maneuvering, forcing their opponents to respond. The Swiss won at [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]], Laupen, [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], [[Battle of Grandson|Grandson]] and [[Battle of Morat|Murten]], and between 1450 and 1550 every leading prince in Europe hired Swiss pikemen, or emulated their tactics and weapons (e.g., the German Landsknechte).

===Welsh &amp; English longbowmen===
{{Main|English longbow}}

The Welsh &amp; English longbowman used a single-piece longbow (but some bows later developed a composite design) to deliver arrows that could penetrate contemporary [[plate armour]] and [[Mail (armour)|mail]]. The longbow was a difficult weapon to master, requiring long years of use and constant practice. A skilled longbowman could shoot about 12 shots per minute.  This rate of fire was far superior to competing weapons like the [[crossbow]] or early gunpowder weapons. The nearest competitor to the longbow was the much more expensive crossbow, used often by urban militias and [[mercenary]] forces. The crossbow had greater penetrating power, and did not require the extended years of training. However, it lacked the rate of fire of the longbow.

At [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] bowmen unleashed clouds of arrows into the ranks of knights. At Crécy, even 15,000 Genoese crossbowmen could not dislodge them from their hill. At Agincourt, thousands of French knights were brought down by armour-piercing [[bodkin point]] arrows and horse-maiming [[Arrowhead#Variants|broadheads]]. Longbowmen decimated an entire generation of the French nobility.

Since the longbow was difficult to deploy in a thrusting mobile offensive, it was best used in a defensive configuration. Bowmen were extended in thin lines and protected and screened by pits (as at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]), staves or trenches. The terrain was usually chosen to put the archers at an advantage forcing their opponents into a bottleneck (at Agincourt) or a hard climb under fire (at Crécy). Sometimes the bowmen were deployed in a shallow &quot;W&quot;, enabling them to trap and enfilade their foes.

The pike and the longbow put an end to the dominance of cavalry in European warfare, making the use of foot soldiers more important than they had been in recent years. Knights began themselves to rather fight dismounted, using two-handed swords, poleaxes and other polearms, as the improved knightly plate armour made them fairly immune to arrows. Gunpowder eventually was to provoke even more significant changes. However, a mounted reserve was often kept, and the heavy cavalry continued to be an important battlefield arm of European armies until the 19th century, when new and more accurate weapons made the mounted soldier too easy a target, with WWI being the last instance where cavalry played a major role in the war.

==Medieval conquerors==
===Arabs===
{{Main|Muslim conquests}}

The initial [[Muslim]] conquests began in the 7th century after the death of the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]], and were marked by a century of rapid [[Arab]] expansion beyond the [[Arabian Peninsula]] under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate]]s. Under the [[Rashidun]], the Arabs [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered the Persian Empire]], along with [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]] and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Roman Egypt]] during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]], all within just seven years from 633 to 640. Under the Umayyads, the Arabs annexed [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] from the Romans and the Arab Empire soon stretched from [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|parts of the Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the Middle East, North Africa, and [[southern Italy]], to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Pyrenees]].

The early Arab army mainly consisted of [[camel]]-mounted [[infantry]], alongside a few [[Bedouin]] [[cavalry]].  Constantly outnumbered by their opponent, they did however possess the advantage of strategic mobility, their camel-borne nature allowing them to constantly outmaneuver larger Byzantine and Sassanid armies to take prime defensive positions.  The [[Rashidun]] cavalry, while lacking the number and mounted archery skill of their Roman and Persian counterparts was for the most part skilfully employed, and played a decisive role in many crucial battles such as [[Yarmouk|Battle of Yarmouk]]. In contrast, the [[Roman army]] and [[Sassanid army|Persian army]] at the time both had large numbers of [[heavy infantry]] and [[heavy cavalry]] ([[cataphract]]s and [[clibanarii]]) that were better equipped, heavily protected, and more experienced and disciplined. However, the Arab invasions came at a time when both ancient powers were exhausted from the protracted [[Byzantine–Sassanid Wars]], particularly the bitterly fought [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628]] which had brought both empires close to collapse.  Also, the typically multi-ethnic Byzantine force was always racked by dissension and lack of command unity, a similar situation also being encountered among the Sassanids who had been embroiled in a bitter civil war for a decade before the coming of the Arabs.  In contrast, the [[Ridda Wars]] has forged the [[Caliphate]]'s army into a united and loyal fighting force.

===Vikings===
{{Main|Viking invasions}}
&lt;!-- moved from Ancient Warfare to more accurate classification as medieval period --&gt;
The [[Viking]]s were a feared force in Europe because of their savagery and speed of their attacks. Whilst seaborne raids were nothing new at the time the Vikings refined the practice to a science through their shipbuilding, tactics and training. Unlike other raiders the Vikings made a lasting impact on the face of Europe. During the [[Viking]] age their expeditions, frequently combined raiding and trading, penetrated most of the old Frankish empire, the British Isles, The Baltic, Russia and both Muslim and Christian Iberia. Many served as mercenaries, and the famed [[Varangian Guard]], serving the Emperor of Constantinople was drawn principally of Scandinavian warriors.

[[Viking]] [[longship]]s were swift and easily manoeuvred, they could navigate deep seas or shallow rivers, and could carry [[warrior]]s that could be rapidly deployed directly onto land due to the longships being able land directly. The longship was the enabler of the [[Viking]] style of warfare that was fast and mobile, relying heavily on the element of surprise, and they tended to capture horses for mobility rather than carry them on their ships. The usual method was to approach a target stealthily, strike with surprise and then retire swiftly. The tactics used were difficult to stop, for the Vikings, like [[guerrilla]] style raiders elsewhere, deployed at a time and place of their own choosing. The fully armoured Viking raider would wear an iron helmet and a maille hauberk, and fight with a combination of axe, sword, shield, spear or great &quot;Danish&quot; two-handed axe, although the typical raider would be unarmoured, carrying only a shield and spear; swords and axes were much less common.

Almost by definition opponents of the Vikings were ill prepared to fight a force that struck at will, with no warning. European countries with a weak system of government would be unable to organize a suitable response would naturally suffer the most to Viking raiders. Viking raiders always had the option to fallback in the face of a superior force or stubborn defence and then reappear to attack other locations or retreat to their bases in what is now Sweden, Denmark, Norway and their Atlantic colonies. As time went on, Viking raids became more sophisticated, with coordinated strikes involving multiple forces and large armies, as the &quot;[[Great Heathen Army]]&quot; that ravaged [[Anglo-Saxon England]] in the 9th century. In time the Vikings began to hold on to the areas they raided, first wintering and then consolidating footholds for further expansion later.

With the growth of centralized authority in the Scandinavian region, Viking raids, always an expression of &quot;private enterprise&quot;, ceased and the raids became pure voyages of conquest. In 1066, King [[Harald Hardråde]] of Norway invaded England, only to be defeated by [[Harold Godwinson]], who in turn was defeated by [[William of Normandy]], descendant of the Viking [[Rollo]], who had accepted Normandy as a fief from the Frankish King. The three rulers had their claims to the English crown (Harald probably primarily on the overlord-ship of Northumbria) and it was this that motivated the battles rather than the lure of plunder.

At this point the Scandinavians had entered their medieval period and consolidated their kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. This period marks the end of significant raider activity both for plunder or conquest. The resurgence of centralized authority throughout Europe limited opportunities for traditional raiding expeditions in the West, whilst the Christianization of the Scandinavian kingdoms themselves encouraged them to direct their attacks against the still predominantly pagan regions of the eastern Baltic. The Scandinavians started adapting more continental European ways, whilst retaining an emphasis on naval power - the &quot;Viking&quot; clinker-built warship was used in war until the 14th century at least. However, developments in shipbuilding elsewhere removed the advantage the Scandinavian countries had previously enjoyed at sea, whilst castle building throughout Europe effectively ended any benefit it might bring.{{Clarify|date=June 2012}} Natural trading and diplomatic links between Scandinavia and Continental Europe ensured that the Scandinavians kept up to date with continental developments in warfare.

The Scandinavian armies of the High Middle Ages followed the usual pattern of the Northern European armies, but with a stronger emphasis on infantry. The terrain of Scandinavia favored heavy infantry, and while the nobles fought mounted in the continental fashion, the Scandinavian peasants formed a well-armed and well-armoured infantry, of which approximately 30% to 50% would be archers or crossbowmen. The [[crossbow]] was especially popular in Sweden and Finland. [[Chainmail]], [[lamellar armour]] and [[coat of plates]] were the usual Scandinavian infantry armour before the era of plate armour.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Mongols===
[[File:Clissa.jpg|right|thumb|220px|During The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Tatars]] under the leadership of [[Kadan]], experienced a major failure in March 1242 at [[Klis Fortress]] in southern [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Povijest Klisa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.klis.com.hr/povijest-klisa/ | title=Povijest Klisa | last=Listeš | first=Srećko | work=klis.hr | publisher=Službene stranice Općine Klis | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Archdeacon 299&quot;&gt;Archdeacon (2006), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Mongol invasions|Tatar invasions}}

By 1241, having conquered large parts of Russia, the Mongols continued the invasion of Europe with a massive three-pronged advance, following the fleeing [[Cumans]], who had established an uncertain alliance with King Bela IV of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. They first invaded [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], and finally Hungary, culminating in the crushing defeat of the Hungarians in the [[Battle of Mohi]]. The Mongol aim seems to have consistently been to defeat the Hungarian-Cuman alliance. The Mongols raided across the borders to Austria and Bohemia in the summer when the Great Khan died, and the Mongol princes returned home to elect a new Great Khan.

The [[Golden Horde]] would frequently clash with Hungarians, Lithuanians and Poles in the thirteenth century, with two large raids in the 1260s and 1280s respectively. In 1284 the Hungarians repelled the last major raid into Hungary, and in 1287 the Poles repelled a raid against them. The instability in the Golden Horde seems to have quieted the western front of the Horde. The Hungarians and Poles had responded to the mobile threat by extensive fortification-building, army reform in the form of better armoured cavalry, and refusing battle unless they could control the site of the battlefield to deny the Mongols local superiority. The Lithuanians relied on their forested homelands for defense, and used their cavalry for raiding into Mongol-dominated Russia.

===Turks===
An early [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] group, the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s, were known for their cavalry archers. These fierce nomads were often raiding empires, such as the [[Byzantine Empire]], and they scored several victories using mobility and timing to defeat the heavy [[cataphract]]s of the Byzantines.

One notable victory was at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]], where a conflict among the generals of the Byzantines gave the Turks the perfect opportunity to strike. They hit the cataphracts with arrows, and outmaneuvered them, then rode down their less mobile infantry with light cavalry that used [[scimitar]]s. When gunpowder was introduced, the [[Ottoman Turks]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] hired the mercenaries that used the gunpowder weapons and obtained their instruction for the [[Janissary|Janissaries]]. Out of these Ottoman soldiers rose the Janissaries (''yeni ceri''; &quot;new soldier&quot;), from which they also recruited many of their heavy infantry. Along with the use of cavalry and early grenades, the Ottomans mounted an offensive in the early Renaissance period and [[Ottoman wars in Europe|attacked Europe]], taking [[Constantinople]] by massed infantry assaults.

Like many other nomadic peoples, the Turks featured a core of heavy cavalry from the upper classes. These evolved into the Sipahis (feudal landholders similar to western knights and Byzantine ''pronoiai'') and Qapukulu (''door slaves'', taken from youth like Janissaries and trained to be royal servants and elite soldiers, mainly cataphracts).
