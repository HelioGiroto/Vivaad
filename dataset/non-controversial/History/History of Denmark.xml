{{More footnotes|date=October 2012}}
The '''history of [[Denmark]]''' dates back about 12,000 years, to the end of the [[Paleolithic|last ice age]], with the earliest evidence of human inhabitation. The [[Danes]] were first documented in written sources around 500 AD, including in the writings  of [[Jordanes]] and [[Procopius]]. With the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Christianization of the Danes]] c. 960 AD, it is clear that there existed a kingship in Scandinavia which controlled roughly the current Danish territory. Queen [[Margrethe II]] can trace her lineage back to the [[Viking]] kings [[Gorm the Old]] and [[Harald Bluetooth]] from this time, making the [[Danish Royal Family]] the oldest in the world.

Denmark's history has particularly been influenced by its geographical location between the [[North sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas. This meant that it was between [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]] and thus at the center of the mutual struggle for control of the Baltic Sea (''[[dominium maris baltici]]''). Denmark was long in disputes with Sweden over control of [[Skånelandene]] ([[Scanian War]]) and [[Norway]], and in disputes with the [[Hanseatic League]] over the duchies of [[Schleswig]] (a Danish [[fief]]) and [[Holstein]] (a German fief). 

Eventually Denmark lost the conflicts and ended up ceding first Skånelandene to Sweden and later [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the [[German Empire]]. After the eventual cession of [[Norway in 1814]], Denmark retained control of the old Norwegian colonies of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. During the 20th century Iceland gained independence, Greenland and the Faroese became integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and [[North Schleswig]] reunited with Denmark 1920 after a referendum. During [[World War II]] Denmark was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and liberated in 1945, after which it joined the [[United Nations]].

The [[Last glacial period|Weichsel glaciation]] covered all of Denmark, except the western coasts of Jutland. It ended around 13,000 years ago allowing humans to move back into the previously ice-covered territories and establish permanent habitation. During the first post-glacial millennia  the landscape gradually changed from [[tundra]] to light forest and a varied fauna including now extinct [[Megafauna]] appeared. Early pre-historic cultures uncovered in modern Denmark include the [[Maglemosian Culture]] (9500-6000 BCE); the [[Kongemose culture]] (6000-5200 BCE); the [[Ertebølle culture]] (5300-3950 BCE); and the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4100-2800 BCE).

The first inhabitants of this early post-glacial landscape in the so-called [[Boreal (period)|Boreal period]], were very small and scattered populations living from hunting of [[reindeer]] and other land mammals and gathering whatever fruits the climate was able to offer. Around 8300 BC the temperature rose drastically, now with summer temperatures around 15 degrees, and the landscape changed into dense forests of [[aspen]], [[birch]] and [[pine]] and the reindeer moved north, while [[aurochs]] and [[moose|elk]] arrived from the south. With a continuing rise in temperature the [[oak]], [[elm]] and [[hazel]] arrived in Denmark around 7000 BC. Now [[boar]], [[red deer]], and [[roe]] also began to abound.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2003:12-18&lt;/ref&gt; 

A burial from Bøgebakken at [[Vedbæk]] dates to ca. 6000 BC and contains 22 persons - including four newborns and one toddler. Eight of the 22 had died before reaching 20 years of age - testifying to the hardness of hunter-gatherer life in the cold north.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2003:24&lt;/ref&gt; Based on estimates of the amount of game animals scholars estimate the population of Denmark to have been between 3300-8000 persons in the time around 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2003:32&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the early hunter-gatherers lived nomadically, exploiting different environments at different times of the year, gradually shifting to the use of semi permanent base camps.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2003:34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Solvogn.jpg|thumb|250px|The famous [[Trundholm sun chariot]] (called ''[[Solvognen]]'' in Danish), a sculpture of the sun pulled by a mare. Scholars have dated it to some time in the 15th century BC and believe that it illustrates an important concept expressed in [[Nordic Bronze Age]] mythology.]]
With the rising temperatures sea levels also rose, so that in the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic period]] Denmark, which had been a contiguous landmass around 11000 BC, by 4500 BC was a series of islands. Humans then shifted to a seafood based diet, which allowed the population to increase.

[[Agriculture|Agricultural]] settlers made inroads around 3000 BC.  The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] period in Denmark featured a culture which buried its dead, with their worldly goods, beneath [[Tumulus|burial mounds]]. Many [[dolmen]]s and rock tombs (especially &quot;passage graves&quot;) date from this period. The many finds of bronze from this era include beautiful religious artifacts and musical instruments, and provide the earliest evidence of [[social class]]es and [[Social stratification|stratification]].

During the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (from the 4th to the 1st century BC), the climate in Denmark and southern [[Scandinavia]] became cooler and wetter, limiting agriculture and setting the stage for local groups to migrate southward into [[Germania]]. At around this time people began to extract iron from the [[bog iron|ore]] in [[peat bog|peat-bog]]s. Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and in much of northwest Europe, and survives in some of the older place-names.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman provinces]], whose frontiers stopped short of Denmark, nevertheless maintained trade-routes and relations with Danish or proto-Danish peoples, as attested by finds of Roman coins. The earliest-known [[runic]] inscription dates back to ''ca.'' 200 — literacy as well probably came from the south. Depletion of cultivated land in the last century BC seems to have contributed to increasing migrations in northern Europe and increasing conflict between Teutonic tribes and Roman settlements in [[Gaul]]. Roman artifacts are especially common in finds from the 1st century. It seems clear that some part of the Danish warrior-[[aristocracy]] served in the [[Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;Birger Storgaard, ''Cosmopolitan aristocrats'', pp. 106-125 in: ''The Spoils of Victory - The North in the shadow of the Roman Empire'', Nationalmuseet, 2003. ISBN 87-7602-006-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally during this time, killings occurred and bodies were thrown into [[bog]]s. In {{As of|2008|alt= recent times}} some of these [[bog body|bog bodies]] have emerged very well preserved, providing valuable information about the people who lived in Denmark during this period.

=== The Germanic Iron Age ===
Historians refer to the [[material culture]] of [[northern Europe]] during the mass-migrations of the 5th to the 7th centuries as the [[Germanic Iron Age]]. Some of the best-known remains from the period include the &quot;peat bog corpses&quot;, among them the well-preserved bodies of two people deliberately strangled: [[Tollund Man]] and [[Haraldskær Woman]].

In his description of [[Scandza]] (from the 6th century work, ''[[Getica (Jordanes)|Getica]]''), the ancient writer [[Jordanes]] says that the '''Dani''' were of the same stock as the ''Suetidi'' (Swedes, ''[[Svitjod|Suithiod]]''?) and expelled the [[Heruli]] and took their lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jordanes]]|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#III |title=''Getica'' III (23) |editor=[[Charles Christopher Mierow|Mierow]] (1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Old English language|Old English]] poems ''[[Widsith]]'' and ''[[Beowulf]]'', as well as works by later Scandinavian writers — notably by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] (c. 1200) — provide some of the earliest references to Danes.

===Viking Age===
{{Main|Viking Age}}
With the beginning of the Viking Age in the 9th century, the prehistoric period in Denmark ends. The Danish people were amongst those known as the [[Viking]]s during the 8th–11th centuries. Viking explorers first discovered and settled in [[Iceland]] in the 9th century, on their way from the [[Faroe Islands]]. From there, [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]] (probably [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) were also settled. Utilizing their great skills in shipbuilding and navigation they raided and conquered parts of [[France]] and the [[British Isles]]. 

They also excelled in trading along the coasts and rivers of Europe, running trade routes from Greenland in the north to [[Constantinople]] in the south via [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Rivers rivers, most notably along the River [[Dnipro]] and via Kiev, then being the capital of [[Kiev Rus]]. The Danish Vikings were most active in Britain, [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], Portugal and Italy where they raided, conquered and settled (their earliest settlements included sites in the [[Danelaw]], [[Ireland]] and [[Normandy]]). The Danelaw resulted when [[Alfred the Great]] was forced to cede half his kingdom to the Vikings, who then settled there for a time and engaged in peaceful trade, but attacks eventually resumed and the English kings had to pay tribute (Danegeld).

In the early 9th century, [[Charlemagne]]'s Christian empire had expanded to the southern border of the Danes, and Frankish sources (e.g. [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker of St Gall]]) provide the earliest historical evidence of the Danes. These report a King [[Gudfred]], who appeared in present day [[Holstein]] with a navy in 804 where diplomacy took place with the [[Franks]]; In 808, King Gudfred attacked the [[Obotrites|Obotrite]] and conquered the city of [[Reric]] whose population was displaced or abducted to [[Hedeby]]. In 809, King Godfred and emissaries of Charlemagne failed to negotiate peace, despite the sister of Godfred being a concubine of Charlemagne, and the next year King Godfred attacked the [[Frisians]] with 200 ships.

[[File:Dannevirke.english.png|thumb|300px|Map showing [[Danevirke]] and [[Hærvejen]].]] 
Viking raids along the coast of France and the Netherlands were large-scale. Paris was besieged and the Loire Valley devastated during the 10th century. One group of Danes were granted permission to settle in northwestern France under the condition that they defend the place from future attacks. As a result, the region became known as &quot;Normandy&quot; and it was the descendants of these settlers who conquered England in 1066.

In addition, the Danes and Norwegians moved west into the Atlantic Ocean, settling on [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and the Shetland Isles. Brief Vikings expeditions to North America around 1000 did not result in any settlements and they were soon driven off by natives. Other Viking raids into Germany and the Mediterranean were short-lived and had no lasting effect.

The oldest parts of the defensive works of Danevirke near [[Hedeby]] at least date from the summer of 755 and were expanded with large works in the 10th century. The size and amount of troops needed to man it indicates a quite powerful ruler in the area, which might be consistent with the kings of the Frankish sources. In 815 AD, Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] attacked Jutland apparently in support of a contender to the throne, perhaps [[Harald Klak]], but was turned back by the sons of Godfred, who most likely were the sons of the above mentioned Godfred. At the same time [[Ansgar|St. Ansgar]] travelled to Hedeby and started the Catholic [[Christianisation of Scandinavia]].

The Danes were united and officially Christianized in 965 AD by [[Harald I of Denmark|Harald Bluetooth]] (see below), the story of which is recorded on the [[Jelling stones]]. The extent of Harald's Danish Kingdom is unknown, although it is reasonable to believe that it stretched from the defensive line of Dannevirke, including the Viking city of Hedeby, across Jutland, the Danish isles and into southern present day [[Sweden]]; [[Scania]] and perhaps [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]]. Furthermore, the Jelling stones attest that Harald had also &quot;won&quot; [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Online Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;Staff. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-516876/Saint-Brices-Day-massacre Saint Brices Day massacre], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for the [[St. Brice's Day massacre]] of Danes in England, the son of Harald, [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] mounted a series of wars of conquest against England. By 1014, England had completely submitted to the Danes. However, distance and a lack of common interests prevented a lasting union, and Harald's son [[Cnut the Great]] barely maintained the link between the two countries, which completely broke up during the reign of his son [[Hardecanute]]. A final attempt by the Norwegians to reconquer England failed, but did pave the way for William the Conqueror's takeover in 1066.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Online Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

Following the death of Canute the Great, Denmark and England were left divided and despite some attempts (see below) were never reunited. 

Canute thanked the Norwegians for their patience and then went from assembly to assembly (Danish:landsting) outlawing any sailor, captain or soldier who refused to pay a fine which amounted to more than a years harvest for most farmers. Canute and his housecarls fled south with a growing army of rebels on his heels. Canute fled to the royal property outside the town of Odense on Funen with his two brothers. After several attempts to break in and then bloody hand to hand fighting in the church, Benedict was cut down and Canute struck in the head by a large stone and then speared from the front. He died at the base of the main altar 10 July 1086, where he was buried by the Benedictines. When Queen Edele came to take Canute's body to Flanders, a light allegedly shone around the church and it was taken as a sign that Canute should remain where he was.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph. The last sentence reads like a legend.|date=May 2012}}

The death of St. Canute marks the end of the Viking Age. Never again would massive flotillas of [[Scandinavia]]ns meet each year to ravage the rest of Christian Europe.

=== Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark ===

{{Scandinavia map, 1219}}

The history of [[Christianity]] in Denmark overlaps with that of the Viking Age. Various petty kingdoms existed throughout the area now known as Denmark for many years. Between c. 960 and the early 980s, [[Harald I of Denmark|Harald Bluetooth]] appears to have established a  kingdom in the lands of the Danes which stretched from Jutland to Skåne. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German [[missionary]] who, according to legend,&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; survived an [[trial by ordeal|ordeal by fire]], which convinced Harold to convert to [[Christianity]]. 

The new [[religion]], which replaced the old [[Norse mythology|Norse religious practices]], had many advantages for the king. Christianity brought with it some support from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It also allowed the king to dismiss many of his opponents who adhered to the old mythology. At this early stage there is no evidence that the Danish Church was able to create a stable administration that Harald could use to exercise more effective control over his kingdom, but it may have contributed to the development of a centralising political and religious ideology among the social elite which sustained and enhanced an increasingly powerful kingship.

[[England]] broke away from Danish control in 1035 and Denmark fell into disarray for some time. Sweyn Estridsen's son, [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute IV]], raided England for the last time in 1085. He planned another invasion to take the [[List of English monarchs|throne of England]] from an aging [[William I of England|William I]]. He called up a fleet of 1,000 Danish ships, 60 Norwegian [[Longship|long boats]], with plans to meet with another 600 ships under [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Duke Robert of Flanders]] in the summer of 1086. 

Canute, however, was beginning to realise that the imposition of the tithe on Danish peasants and nobles to fund the expansion of monasteries and churches and a new [[Poll tax|head tax]] (Danish:nefgjald) had brought his people to the verge of rebellion. Canute took weeks to arrive at Struer where the fleet had assembled, but he found only the [[Norway|Norwegians]] still there. Canute's nephew [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridson]] (1020–74) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with [[Archbishop]] [[Adalbert of Hamburg]]-[[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] — at that time the Archbishop of all of [[Scandinavia]].

In the early 12th century Denmark became the seat of an independent [[ecclesiastical province|church province]] of Scandinavia. Not long after that, [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] established their own archbishoprics, free of Danish control. The mid-12th century proved a difficult time for the kingdom of Denmark. Violent [[civil war]]s rocked the land. Eventually, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar the Great]] (1131–82), gained control of the kingdom, stabilizing it and reorganizing the administration. King Valdemar and [[Absalon]] (''ca'' 1128–1201), the [[Roskilde (titular see)|bishop of Roskilde]], rebuilt the country. 

During Valdemar's reign construction began of a castle in the village of Havn, leading eventually to the foundation of [[Copenhagen]], the modern capital of Denmark. Valdemar and Absalon built Denmark into a major power in the [[Baltic Sea]], a power which later competed with the [[Hanseatic League]], the counts of [[Holstein]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] for trade, territory, and influence throughout the Baltic. In 1168, Valdemar and Absalon gained a foothold on the southern shore of the Baltic, when they subdued the [[Principality of Rügen]].

In the 1180s, [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] came under Danish control, too. In the new southern provinces, the Danes promoted Christianity (mission of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]], monasteries like [[Eldena Abbey]]) and settlement (Danish participation in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). The Danes lost most of their southern gains after the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)]], but the Rugian principality stayed with Denmark until 1325.

In 1202, [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] became king and launched various &quot;[[crusades]]&quot; to claim territories, notably modern [[Estonia]]. Legend has it that the Danish flag, the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] fell from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]] in Estonia in 1219. A series of Danish defeats culminating in the Battle of Bornhöved on 22 July 1227 cemented the loss of Denmark's north German territories. Valdemar himself was saved only by the courageous actions of a German knight who carried Valdemar to safety on his horse.

From that time on Valdemar focused his efforts on domestic affairs. One of the changes he instituted was the feudal system where he gave properties to men with the understanding that they owed him service. This increased the power of the noble families ({{lang-da|højadelen}}) and gave rise to the lesser nobles ({{lang-da|lavadelen}}) who controlled most of Denmark. Free peasants lost the traditional rights and privileges they had enjoyed since Viking times.[3]

The king of Denmark had difficulty maintaining control of the kingdom in the face of opposition from the [[nobility]] and from the Church. An extended period of strained relations between the crown and the [[Pope]]s of [[Rome]] took place, known as the &quot;archiepiscopal conflicts&quot;.

By the late 13th century, royal power had waned, and the nobility forced the king to grant a [[charter]], considered Denmark's first [[constitution]]. Following the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]] in 1227, a weakened Denmark provided windows of opportunity to both the Hanseatic League and the [[count of Holstein|Counts of Holstein]]. The Holstein Counts gained control of large portions of Denmark because the king would grant them fiefs in exchange for money to finance royal operations.

Valdemar spent the remainder of his life putting together a code of laws for [[Jutland]], [[Zealand]] and [[Skåne]]. These codes were used as Denmark's legal code until 1683. This was a significant change from the local law making at the regional assemblies ({{lang-da|landting}}) had been the long-standing tradition. Several methods of determining guilt or innocence were outlawed including trial by ordeal and trial by combat. The [[Code of Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jyske Lov}}) was approved at meeting of the nobility at Vordingborg in 1241 just prior to Valdemar's death. Because of his position as &quot;the king of Dannebrog&quot; and as a legislator, Valdemar enjoys a central position in Danish history. To posterity the civil wars and dissolution that followed his death made him appear to be the last king of a golden age.

The [[Middle Ages]] saw a period of close cooperation between the [[The Crown|Crown]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Thousands of church buildings sprang up throughout the country during this time. The economy expanded during the 12th century, based mostly on the lucrative [[herring]]-trade, but the 13th century turned into a period of difficulty and saw the temporary collapse of royal authority.

=== Difficulties for the kings ===
During the disastrous reign of [[Christopher II of Denmark|Christopher II]] (1319–1332), most of the country was pawned off to the counts (except Skåne, which went to Sweden) after peasant revolts and conflicts with the Church. For eight years after Christopher's death, Denmark had no king, and was instead controlled by the counts. After one of them was assassinated in 1340, Christopher's son [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar]] was chosen as king, and gradually began to recover the pawned territories, which was completed in 1360. 

The [[Black Death]], which came to Denmark during these years, also aided Valdemar's campaign. His continued efforts to expand the kingdom after 1360 brought him into open conflict with the Hanseatic League. He conquered [[Gotland]], much to the displeasure of the League, which lost [[Visby]], an important trading town located there. 

The Hanseatic alliance with Sweden to attack Denmark initially proved a fiasco since Danish forces captured a large Hanseatic fleet, and ransomed it back for an enormous sum. Luckily for the League, the Jutland nobles revolted against the heavy taxes levied to fight the  expansionist war in the Baltic; the two forces worked against the king, forcing him into exile in 1370. For several years, the Hanseatic League controlled the fortresses  on &quot;[[Öresund|the sound]]&quot; between Skåne and Zealand.

=== Margaret and the Kalmar Union (1397–1523)===
{{main|Kalmar Union}}

[[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]], the daughter of Valdemar Atterdag, found herself married off to [[Haakon VI of Norway|Håkon VI of Norway]] in an attempt to join the two kingdoms, along with Sweden, since Håkon had kinship ties to the Swedish royal family. The dynastic plans called for her son, [[Olaf IV of Norway|Olaf II]] to rule the three kingdoms, but after his early death in 1387 she took on the role herself (1387–1412). During her lifetime (1353–1412) the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (including the [[Faroe Islands]], as well as [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and present-day [[Finland]]) became linked under her capable rule, in what became known as the [[Kalmar Union]], made official in 1397.
[[File:Roskilde Margrethe1 grave.jpg|thumb|250px|The tomb of [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]].]]

Her successor, [[Eric VII of Denmark|Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439), lacked Margaret's skill and thus directly caused the breakup of the Kalmar Union. Eric's foreign policy engulfed Denmark in a succession of wars with the Holstein counts and the city of Lubeck. When the Hanseatic League imposed a trade embargo on Scandinavia, the Swedes (who saw their mining industry adversely affected) rose up in revolt. The three countries of the Kalmar Union all declared Eric deposed in 1439. 

However, support for the idea of regionalism continued, so when Eric's nephew [[Christopher of Bavaria]] came to the throne in 1440, he managed to get himself elected in all three kingdoms, briefly reuniting Scandinavia (1442–1448). The Swedish nobility grew increasingly unhappy with Danish rule and the union soon became merely a legal concept with little practical application. During the subsequent reigns of Christian I (1450–1481) and Hans (1481–1513), tensions grew, and several wars between Sweden and Denmark erupted.

In the early 16th century, [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] (reigned 1513–1523) came to power. He allegedly declared, &quot;If the hat on my head knew what I was thinking, I would pull it off and throw it away.&quot; This quotation apparently refers to his devious and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|machiavellian]] political dealings. He conquered Sweden in an attempt to reinforce the union, and had about 100 leaders of the Swedish anti-unionist forces killed in what came to be known as the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] of November 1520. The bloodbath destroyed any lingering hope of Scandinavian union.

In the aftermath of [[Sweden]]'s definitive secession from the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1521, [[civil war]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] followed in Denmark and Norway. When things settled down, the [[Privy Council]] of Denmark had lost some of its influence, and that of Norway no longer existed. The two kingdoms, known as [[Denmark–Norway]], operated in a personal union under a single monarch. Norway kept its separate laws and some institutions, such as a royal [[chancellor]], separate coinage and a separate army. As an hereditary kingdom, Norway's status as separate from Denmark remained important to the royal dynasty in its struggles to win elections as kings of Denmark. The two kingdoms remained tied until 1814.

=== The Reformation ===
{{main|Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein}}
[[Image:Hans tausen.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hans Tausen]] was one of the first Lutheran preachers, and later a bishop, in Denmark.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which originated in the German lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), had a considerable impact on Denmark.  The Danish Reformation started in the mid-1520s.  Some Danes wanted access to the [[Bible]] in their own language.  In 1524 Hans Mikkelsen and [[Christiern Pedersen]] translated the [[New Testament]] into Danish; it became an instant best-seller.  Those who had traveled to [[Wittenberg]] in Saxony and come under the influence of the teachings of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and his associates included [[Hans Tausen]], a Danish monk in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John Hospitallers]].  On Good Friday in 1525, Tausen used the pulpit at [[Antvorskov]] Abbey Church to proclaim Luther's reforms.  His scandalized superiors ordered him out of Zealand and held him in the priory at [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] under close confinement until he should come to his senses.&lt;ref name=&quot;runeberg.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Townspeople came to see the troublesome monk, and Tausen preached to them from the window of his cell.  Within days Tausen's ideas swept through the town.  The then radical ideas of Luther found a receptive audience.  Tausen's preaching converted ordinary people, merchants, nobles, and monks and even the Prior grew to appreciate Tausen and ordered his release.  Tausen preached openly: much to the consternation of Bishop Jøn Friis, who lost his ability to do anything about the Lutherans and retreated to Hald Castle.  After preaching in the open air, Tausen gained the use of a small chapel, which soon proved too small for the crowds who attended services in Danish.  His followers broke open a Franciscan Abbey so they could listen to Tausen, who packed the church daily for services. The town leaders protected Tausen from the Bishop of Viborg.&lt;ref name=&quot;runeberg.org&quot;/&gt;
Viborg became the center for the Danish Reformation for a time.  Lutheranism spread quickly to [[Aarhus]] and [[Aalborg]].

Within months King [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick]] appointed Tausen as one of his personal chaplains (October 1526) in order to protect him from Catholics. Tausen's version of Luther's ideas spread throughout Denmark.  Copenhagen became a hotbed of reformist activity and Tausen moved there to continue his work.  His reputation preceded him and the excitement of hearing the liturgy in Danish brought thousands of people out to hear him.  With the kings' permission, churches in Copenhagen opened their doors to the Lutherans and held services for Catholics and for Lutherans at different times of the day.  But at Our Lady Church, the main church of Copenhagen,  Bishop Ronnow refused to admit the &quot;heretics&quot;. In December 1531 a mob stormed the [[Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen, encouraged by Copenhagen's fiery mayor, [[Ambrosius Bogbinder]].  They tore down statues and side-altars and destroyed artwork and reliquaries.  Frederick I's policy of toleration insisted that the two competing groups share churches and pulpits peacefully, but this satisfied neither Lutherans nor Catholics.
   
Luther's ideas spread rapidly as a consequence of a powerful combination of popular enthusiasm for church reform and a royal eagerness to secure greater wealth through the seizure of church lands and property. In Denmark the reformation increased the crown's revenues by 300%.

Dissatisfaction with the established Catholic Church had already been widespread in Denmark. Many people viewed the [[tithe]]s and fees — a constant source of irritation for farmers and merchants — as unjust. This became apparent once word got out that King Frederick and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Duke Christian]] had no sympathy with Franciscans who persistently made the rounds of the parishes to collect food, money, and clothing in addition to the tithes. Between 1527 and 1536 many towns petitioned the king to close the Franciscan houses. Frederick obliged by sending letters authorizing the closure of the monasteries, often offering a small sum of money to help the brothers on their way. With the royal letter in hand, mobs forcibly closed [[Franciscan]] abbeys all over Denmark. They beat up monks, two of whom died.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Krønike om Gråbrodrenes Udjagelse''
&lt;/ref&gt;
The closure of Franciscan houses occurred systematically in Copenhagen, Viborg, Aalborg, Randers, Malmo and ten other cities; in all, 28 monasteries or houses closed.  People literally hounded Franciscan monks out of the towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
No other order faced such harsh treatment. Considering how strongly many people felt about removing all traces of Catholic traditions from Danish churches, surprisingly little violence took place.  Luther's teaching had become so overwhelmingly popular that Danes systematically cleared churches of statues, paintings, wall-hangings, reliquaries and other Catholic elements without interference. The only exceptions came in individual churches where the local churchmen refused to permit reform.

[[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] died in 1533; the Viborg Assembly (Danish:landsting) [[Election of Christian III|proclaimed his son, Duke Christian of Schleswig, King Christian III]].  The State Council (Danish: Rigsråd) on Zealand, led by the Catholic bishops took control of the country and refused to recognize the election of Christian III, a staunch Lutheran.   The regents feared Christian's zeal for Luther's ideas would tip the balance and disenfranchise Catholics — both peasants and nobles.  The State Council encouraged Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to become Regent of Denmark. Christian III quickly raised an army to enforce his election, including mercenary troops from Germany.  Count Christopher raised an army (including troops from [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Oldenburg]] and the Hanseatic League, especially [[Lűbeck]]) to restore his Catholic uncle King [[Christian II]] (deposed in 1523). This resulted in a three-year civil war called the [[Count's Feud]] (Danish: ''Grevens Fejde'').

Armed rebellion by Catholic peasants led by [[Skipper Clement]] started in northern Jutland. Rebellion swept across [[Funen]], Zealand and Skåne.  Christian III's army soundly defeated an army of Catholic nobles at Svenstrup on 16 October 1534.  Christian forced a truce with the [[Hanseatic League]], which had sent troops to help Count Christopher.  Christian III's army, under [[Johan Rantzau]], chased the rebels all the way back to [[Aalborg]] and then massacred over two thousand of them inside the city in December 1534.  The Protestants captured Skipper Clement (1534), and later executed him in 1536. Christian III's mercenary troops put an end to Catholic hopes on Zealand and then Funen. Skåne rebels went as far as proclaiming Christian II king again. King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] of Sweden sent two separate armies to ravage [[Halland]] and Skåne into submission. Besiegers finally starved the last hold-outs in the rebellion, Copenhagen and [[Malmø]], into surrender in July 1536. By the spring of 1536 Christian III had taken firm control.

Denmark became officially Lutheran on 30 October 1536 by decree of King Christian III, and in 1537 the reconstituted State Council approved the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Lutheran Ordinances]] which was worked out by Danish theologians and [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], based on Luther's [[Augsburg Confession]] and Luther's [[Small Catechism|Little Catechism]]. The government established the Danish National Church (Danish: ''Folkekirken'') as the [[state church]]. All of Denmark's Catholic bishops went to prison until such time as they accepted Luther's reforms. The authorities released them when they promised to marry and to support the reforms. If they agreed, they received property and spent the rest of their lives as wealthy landowners.  If they refused, they died in prison. The State confiscated Church lands to pay for the armies that had enforced Christian III's election. Priests swore allegiance to Lutheranism or found new employment. The new owners turned monks out of their monasteries and abbeys. Nuns in a few places gained permission to live out their lives in nunneries, though without governmental financial support. The Crown closed churches, abbeys, priories and cathedrals, giving their property to local nobles or selling it. The King appointed Danish superintendents (later bishops) to oversee Lutheran orthodoxy in the church. Denmark became part of a Lutheran heartland extending through Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Catholic Church everywhere in Scandinavia had sealed its fate by supporting hopeless causes: Christian II and the emperor Charles V in Denmark, Norwegian independence in that country, and in Sweden the Kalmar Union. Geographical distance also prevented them from receiving anything more than a sympathetic ear from Rome.

The 17th century saw a period of strict Lutheran [[orthodoxy]] in Denmark, with harsh punishments visited on suspected followers of either [[John Calvin|Calvinism]] or [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. Lutheran authorities treated Catholics harshly — in the fear that they might undermine the king, government, and national church.  In a delayed result of the Reformation, Denmark became involved in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) on the Protestant side.  As a result Denmark lost its position as a major power.

=== The loss of Eastern Denmark ===
{{see also|Dominium maris baltici}}

The [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian Kingdom]] grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the [[Øresund]], which Danes could tax because Denmark controlled both sides of the Sound. The trade in grain exports from [[Poland]] to the [[Netherlands]] and to the rest of Europe grew enormously at this time, and the Danish kings did not hesitate to cash in on it. The Sound duty was only repealed in the 1840s.

The Danish economy benefited from the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) in the [[Netherlands]] because a large number of skilled refugees from that area (the most economically advanced in Europe) came to Denmark. This helped to modernize many aspects of society and to establish trading links between Denmark and the Netherlands.

[[Denmark–Norway]] had a reputation as a relatively powerful kingdom at this time. European politics of the 16th century revolved largely around the struggle between Catholic and Protestant forces, so it seemed almost inevitable that Denmark, a strong, unified Lutheran kingdom, would get drawn into the larger war when it came. The [[Thirty Years' War]] went badly for the Protestant states in the early 1620s, and a call went out to [[Denmark–Norway]] to &quot;save the Protestant cause&quot;. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], who was also a duke of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for his possessions in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], decided to intervene. The campaign [[Battle of Wolgast|ended in defeat]] and the occupation of Jutland by the imperial army of [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]. In the [[Treaty of Lübeck]], Christian made peace and agreed to not intervene in Germany again. The war in Germany had been very expensive and [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] saw no other way than to raise the Sound duty. Unfortunately, this pushed the [[Netherlands]] away from Denmark and into the arms of Sweden. In 1643, Sweden's armies, under the command of [[Lennart Torstenson]], then suddenly invaded Denmark without declaring war, this war became known as the [[Torstenson War]]. The [[Netherlands]], wishing to end the Danish stranglehold on the Baltic, joined the Swedes in their war against [[Denmark–Norway]]. In October 1644 a combined Dutch-Swedish fleet destroyed 80 percent of the Danish fleet in the Battle of Femern. The result of this defeat proved disastrous for [[Denmark–Norway]]: in the [[Second treaty of Brömsebro (1645)]] Denmark ceded to Sweden the Norwegian provinces [[Jemtland]], [[Herjedalen]] and [[Älvdalen Municipality|Älvdalen]] as well as the Danish islands of [[Gotland]] and [[Saaremaa|Øsel]]. [[Halland]] went to Sweden for a period of 30 years and the [[Netherlands]] were exempt from paying the Sound Duty.

Nevertheless, Danes remember Christian IV as one of the great kings of Denmark. He had a very long reign, from 1588 to 1648, and has become known as &quot;the architect on the Danish throne&quot; because of the large number of building [[project]]s he undertook. Many of the great buildings of Denmark date from his reign.

After the death of Christian IV in 1648, his son Frederick succeeded him. In 1657, during the [[Second Northern War]], [[Denmark–Norway]] launched a war of revenge against Sweden (then distracted in Poland) which turned into a complete disaster. The war became a disaster for two reasons: Primarily, because Denmark's new powerful ally, the [[Netherlands]], remained neutral as Denmark was the aggressor and Sweden the defender. Secondly, the Belts froze over in a rare occurrence during the winter of 1657-1658, allowing [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] to [[March across the Belts|lead his armies across the ice]] to invade [[Zealand]]. In the [[Treaty of Roskilde]], [[Denmark–Norway]] capitulated and gave up all of [[Terra Scania|Eastern Denmark]] (Danish: Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and [[Bornholm]]), in addition to the counties of [[Bahusia]] (Norwegian: Båhuslen) and [[Trøndelag]] in Norway. [[Holstein-Gottorp]] was also tied to Sweden, providing a gateway for future invasions from the south. But the Second Northern War was not yet over. Three months after the peace treaty was signed, [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] held a council of war where he decided to simply wipe Denmark from the map and unite all of Scandinavia under his rule. Once again the Swedish army arrived outside Copenhagen. However, this time the Danes did not panic nor surrender, instead they decided to fight and prepared to defend Copenhagen. [[Frederick III of Denmark]] had stayed in his capital and now encouraged the citizens of Copenhagen to resist the Swedes, by saying he would die in his nest. Furthermore, this unprovoked declaration of war by Sweden finally triggered the alliance that [[Denmark–Norway]] had with the [[Netherlands]]. A powerful Dutch fleet was sent to Copenhagen with vital supplies and reinforcements, which saved the city from being captured during the [[Assault on Copenhagen|Swedish attack]]. Furthermore,  [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Habsburg monarchy]] had gathered large forces to aid [[Denmark–Norway]] and fighting continued into 1659. [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] suddenly died of an illness in early 1660, while planning an invasion of Norway. Following his death, Sweden made peace in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]], returning only [[Trøndelag]] to Norway and [[Bornholm]] to Denmark, but keeping both [[Bahusia]] and [[Terra Scania]], mainly because the [[Netherlands]] and other European powers didn't want both sides of the Sound controlled by the Danish King again. Thus establishing the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden that still exist today.

=== Absolutism ===

As a result of the disaster in the war against Sweden, [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederick III]] (reigned 1648–1670) succeeded in convincing the nobles to give up some of their powers and their exemption from taxes, leading to the era of [[political absolutism|absolutism]] in Denmark. The country's main objective in the following decades was the recovery of its lost provinces from Sweden. In the 1670s [[Denmark–Norway]] had regained enough strength to start [[Scanian War|a war with Sweden to recover its lost provinces]]. However, in spite of Denmark's outside support, naval dominance and initial support from the population of [[Terra Scania|the former eastern provinces]], the war ended in a bitter [[Peace of Lund|stalemate]]. A renewed attack during the [[Great Northern War|Third Northern War]] (1700–1721) first resulted in the unfavourable [[Peace of Travendal]], but after Denmark's re-entrance in the war and Sweden's ultimate defeat by a large alliance, meant that Sweden no longer was a threat to Denmark. However, the great powers opposed any Danish territorial gains, which meant the [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] did not return the former eastern provinces to Denmark. Furthermore, Denmark was even forced to return [[Swedish Pomerania]] [[Siege of Stralsund (1711–1715)|held by Danish forces since 1715]] to Sweden. Denmark now had no hope of recovering its lost provinces from Sweden. As noted earlier, the rest of Europe was simply against the Sound being controlled by a single nation again.

For most of the 18th century, Denmark was at peace. The only time when war threatened was in 1762 when the Duke of Gottorp became Tsar [[Peter III of Russia]] and declared war on Denmark. But he was soon deposed, and the threat ended. 

With the suspension of the Danish [[diet (assembly)|diet]], that body disappeared for a couple of centuries. During this time power became increasingly centralized in Copenhagen. Frederick's government reorganized itself in a much more hierarchical manner, built around the king as a focal point of administration. Crown officials dominated the administration, as well as a new group of bureaucrats, much to the dismay of the traditional aristocracy, who saw their own influence curtailed even further. The absolutist kings of Denmark were quite weak compared to their Swedish counterparts, and non-noble landlords became the real rulers of the country. They used their influence to pass laws that favored themselves.

The administration and laws underwent &quot;modernization&quot; during this period. In 1683 the ''Danske lov 1683'' ([[Danish Code]]) standardized and collected all the old provincial laws.

Other initiatives included the standardization of all [[weights and measures]] throughout the kingdom, and an agricultural survey and registry. This survey allowed the government to begin taxing landowners directly, moving it beyond dependence on revenue from [[crown land]]s.

The population of Denmark rose steadily through this period, from 600,000 in 1660 (after the loss of territory to Sweden) to 700,000 in 1720. By 1807 it had risen to 978,000.

Attempts to diversify the economy away from agriculture failed. During this period little industry existed, except for a very small amount in Copenhagen (population: 30,000). In the late 17th century a small amount of industry did develop, catering to the military. Denmark suffered in part because of its lack of natural resources. It had nothing much to export except agricultural products. The Netherlands bought the largest share of Denmark's exports. The landlords, only about 300 in number, nevertheless owned 90% of the land in the country.

Rural administration remained primarily the preserve of the large landholders and of a few law-enforcement officials. In 1733, low crop prices caused the introduction of [[adscription]], an effort by the landlords to obtain cheap labor. The effect of this was to turn the previously free Danish peasantry into serfs. The adscription system tied rural laborers to their place of birth and required them to rent farms on the estates. As rent, they were required to work the landlords' plots and could not negotiate contracts or demand payment for improvements made to the farm. Peasants who refused to rent a farm were subject to six years of military service. Danish agriculture was very inefficient and unproductive as a result, since the peasants had no motivation to perform anything more than the absolute minimum of work. Attempts to sell Danish grain in Norway failed because of its low quality compared to grain from the Baltic.

In the late 18th century, extensive agricultural reforms took place, involving the abolition of the old [[Open field system|open-field system]] and the amalgamation of many smaller farms into larger ones. With the abolition of the adscription system, the military could now only obtain manpower through conscription. These reforms were possible because agricultural prices steadily rose in the second half of the century. 

Throughout the 18th century the Danish economy did very well, largely on the basis of expanded agricultural output to meet growing demand across Europe. Danish merchant ships also traded around Europe and the North Atlantic, venturing to new [[Danish colonization of the Americas|Danish colonies]] in the Caribbean and North Atlantic.

New propriety and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas became popular among the [[middle class]]es of Denmark, arousing increased interest in [[personal liberty]]. In the last 15 years of the 18th century the authorities relaxed the censorship which had existed since the beginning of the 17th century. At the same time, a sense of Danish nationalism began to develop. Hostility increased against Germans and Norwegians present at the royal court. Pride in the Danish language and culture increased, and eventually a law banned &quot;foreigners&quot; from holding posts in the government. Antagonism between Germans and Danes increased from the mid-18th century on. In the 1770s, during the reign of the mentally unstable Christian VII (1766–1808), the queen's lover, a German doctor named [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]], became the real ruler of the country. Filled with the ideas of the Enlightenment, he attempted a number of radical reforms including freedom of the press and religion. But it was short-lived. The landlords feared that the reforms were a threat to their power, while the commoners believed that religious freedom was an invitation to atheism. In 1772, Struensee was arrested, tried, and convicted of crimes against the majesty, his right hand was cut off following his beheading, his remains were quartered and put on display on top of spikes on the commons west of Copenhagen. The next 12 years were a period of unmitigated reaction until a group of reformers gained power in 1784.

Denmark became the model of enlightened despotism, partially influenced by the outbreak of the French Revolution. Between 1784 and 1815, the abolition of [[serfdom]] made the majority of the peasants into landowners.  The government also introduced [[free trade]] and [[universal education]].

=== Colonialism ===

{{main|Danish colonization of the Americas|Danish colonial empire}}

[[Image:Denmark-Norway and possessions.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing Denmark–Norway's colonial possessions c. 1800]]

Denmark maintained a number of [[colonies]] outside Scandinavia, starting in the 17th century and lasting until the 20th century. Denmark also controlled traditional colonies in Greenland and Iceland in the north Atlantic — held through the union with Norway. [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] (reigned 1588–1648) first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark's overseas trade, as part of the [[mercantilist]] trend then popular in European governing circles. Denmark established its own first colony  at [[Tranquebar]], or Trankebar, on India's south coast, in 1620. In the [[Caribbean]] Denmark started a colony on [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] in 1671, [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St John]] in 1718, and purchased [[Saint Croix]] from [[France]] in 1733. Denmark maintained its Indian colony, Tranquebar, as well as several other smaller colonies there, for about two hundred years. The [[Danish East India Company]] operated out of Tranquebar. During its heyday, the Danish company and the [[Swedish East India Company]] imported more tea than the [[British East India Company]] — and smuggled 90% of it into Britain, where it sold at a huge profit. Both of the Scandinavia-based East India Companies folded during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. Danes also maintained other colonies, forts, and bases in West Africa, primarily for the purpose of [[Slavery|slave]]-trading.

== The 19th century ==
=== The Napoleonic Wars ===

[[Image:Slaget på reden.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Battle of Copenhagen, 1801.]]

The long decades of peace came to an abrupt end during the Napoleonic Wars. Britain felt threatened by the Armed Neutrality Treaty of 1794, which originally involved Denmark and Sweden, and later Prussia and Russia. The [[Royal Navy|British fleet]] attacked Copenhagen in 1801 ([[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]]), destroying much of Denmark's navy. Denmark nonetheless managed to remain uninvolved in the Napoleonic Wars until 1807. The British [[Naval fleet|fleet]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombarded Copenhagen]] again that year, causing considerable destruction to the city. They then captured the entire Danish fleet so that it couldn't be used by France to invade Britain (as the French had lost their own fleet at Trafalgar in 1805), leading to the [[Gunboat War]] (1807–1814). The confiscation of the Danish navy was widely criticised in Britain.

In 1809 Danish forces fighting on the French side participated in defeating the anti-Bonapartist German rebellion led by [[Ferdinand von Schill]], at the [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|Battle of Stralsund]]. By 1813, Denmark could no longer bear the war costs, and the [[National bankruptcy|state was bankrupt]]. When in the same year the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] isolated Denmark by clearing Northern Germany of French forces, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]] had to make peace. Accordingly, the unfavourable [[Treaty of Kiel]] was concluded in January 1814 with Sweden and Great Britain, and another peace was signed with Russia in February.

The post-Napoleonic [[Congress of Vienna]] demanded the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union, and this was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814. The treaty transferred [[Heligoland]] to Great Britain and [[Norway]] from the Danish to the Swedish crown, Denmark was to be satisfied with [[Swedish Pomerania]]. But the [[Norway in 1814|Norwegians revolted]], declared their independence, and elected crown-prince Christian Frederick (the future [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]]) as their king. However, the Norwegian independence movement failed to attract any support from the European powers. After a brief war with Sweden, Christian had to abdicate in order to preserve Norwegian autonomy, established in a [[personal union]] with Sweden. In favour of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Denmark renounced her claims to Swedish Pomerania at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), and instead was satisfied with the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] and a Prussian payment of 3.5 million talers, also, Prussia took over a Danish 600,000 talers debt to Sweden.

Interestingly, this period also counts as &quot;the Golden Age&quot; of Danish [[intellectual history]]. A sign of renewed intellectual vigor was the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1814. Literature, painting, sculpture, and philosophy all experienced an unusually vibrant period. The stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805–1875) became popular not only in Denmark, but all over Europe and in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hans Christian Andersen: Danish Writer and Citizen of the World | editor=Sven Hakon Rossel  |year=1996 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn= |pages=52-54 |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideas of the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) spread far beyond Denmark, influencing not only his own era, but proving instrumental in the development of new philosophical systems after him.  The sculptures of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen|Thorvaldsen]] (1770–1834) grace public buildings all over Denmark and other artists appreciated and copied his style. [[Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] (1783–1872) tried to reinvigorate the Danish National Church and contributed to the hymns used by the church in Denmark.

=== Nationalism and liberalism ===
{{see also|History of Schleswig-Holstein}}
[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|''Den Grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling''&lt;br&gt; The Constitutional Assembly created The [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]], 1860–1864 painting by [[Constantin Hansen]]]]
The Danish [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[nationalism|national]] movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on June 5, 1849. The growing [[bourgeoisie]] had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, [[Separation of powers|separating the powers]] and granting the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the [[executive branch]]. The [[legislative branch]] consisted of two parliamentary chambers; the [[Folketing]], comprising members elected by the general population, and the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], elected by landowners. Denmark also gained an independent [[judiciary]]. 

Another significant result of the revolution was the [[Abolition of Slavery]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], the Danish colony in the [[Caribbean]], which at an earlier parts of its history witnessed the biggest slave auctions in the world. In 1845 Denmark's other tropical colony, [[Tranquebar]] in [[India]], had already in 1845 been sold to [[British India|Britain]].

The Danish king's realm still consisted of the islands, the northern half of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, and the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in [[real union]] with the [[Duchy of Holstein]]

[[File:Første Infanteriregiment i Haandgemæng med Regimentet Martini.png|thumb|left|Danish Infantry regiment in a fight with regiment &quot;Martini&quot;. Contemporary illustration of the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]].]]
The islands and Jutland together constituted the kingdom, whereas the monarch held the duchies in [[personal union]] with the kingdom. The duchy of Schleswig constituted a Danish [[fief]], while the Duchy of Holstein remained a part of the [[German Confederation]]. 

Since the early 18th century, and even more so from the early 19th century, the Danes had become used to viewing the duchies and the kingdom as increasingly unified in one [[Sovereign state|state]]. This view, however, clashed with that of the German majority in the duchies, also enthused by liberal and national trends, which lead to a movement known as Schleswig-Holsteinism. Schleswig-Holsteinists aimed for independence from Denmark. The [[First Schleswig War]] (1848–1851) broke out after constitutional change in 1849 and ended with the ''status quo'' only thanks to the intervention of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and other Great Powers. 

Much debate took place in Denmark as to how to deal with the question of Schleswig-Holstein. National-Liberals demanded permanent ties between Schleswig and Denmark, but stated that Holstein could do as it pleased. However, international events overtook domestic Danish politics, and Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]] (1864). The war lasted from February to October 1864. Denmark was easily beaten by Prussia and Austria, and obliged to relinquish Schleswig-Holstein.

The war caused Denmark as a nation severe trauma, forcing it to reconsider its place in the world. The loss of Schleswig-Holstein came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. The Danish state had now lost some of the richest areas of the kingdom: Skåne to Sweden and Schleswig to Germany, so the nation focused on developing the poorer areas of the country. Extensive agricultural improvements took place in Jutland, and a new form of nationalism, which emphasized the &quot;small&quot; people, the decency of rural Denmark, and the shunning of wider aspirations, developed. 

Industrialization came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century. The nation's first railroads were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. Trade unions developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centered around the export of dairy and meat products.

The two concepts of internationalism and nationalism have become very much part of the history of the Danish [[Labour movement]].

The Labour movement gathered momentum when social issues became associated with internationalism. Socialist theory and organisational contact with the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]], which linked labour movements in various countries, paved the way. [[Louis Pio]] emerged as the driving force. In 1871, following the bloody defeat of the [[Paris Commune]], he started publishing socialist journalism. He campaigned strongly for an independent organisation of the workers under their own management, and organised a Danish branch of the First International. This became the foundation stone for the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] under the name of Den Internationale Arbejderforening for Danmark (The International Labour Association for Denmark). As a combination of union and political party, it adroitly brought together national and international elements.

Pio saw internationalism as vital for the success of the workers' struggle: without internationalism, no progress. He pointed out that the middle classes cooperated across national frontiers and used nationalistic rhetoric as a weapon against the workers and their liberation.

The Danish section started organising strikes and demonstrations for higher wages and social reforms. Moderate demands, but enough to provoke the employers and the forces of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. Things came to a head in the Battle of [[Fælledparken|Fælleden]] on 5 May 1872. The authorities arrested the three leaders, Louis Pio, [[Poul Geleff]] and Harald Brix, charged them and convicted them of high treason. The three left Denmark for the United States to set up the ill-starred and short-lived socialist colony near Hays City, in [[Ellis County, Kansas]].

Back in Denmark, the emerging political situation made possible by the new constitution alarmed many of the existing elites, since it inevitably [[empowerment|empower]]ed the peasantry. Simple men with little education replaced professors and professionals in positions of power. The peasants, in coalition with liberal and radical elements from the cities, eventually won a majority of seats in the Folketing. Even though constitutional changes had taken place to boost the power of the Landsting, the Left ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' Party demanded to form the government, but the king, still the head of the executive branch, refused. However in 1901, king [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] gave in and asked [[Johan Henrik Deuntzer]], a member of Venstre, to form a government, the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]]. This began a tradition of [[parliamentary government]], and with the exception of the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], no government since 1901 has ruled against a parliamentary majority in the Folketing.

=== Monetary union ===
{{main|Scandinavian Monetary Union}}
[[Image:Skandinavism.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scandinavism]]; A 19th-century propaganda image of Norwegian, Danish and Swedish soldiers joining hands]]
The [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]], a [[monetary union]] formed by Sweden and Denmark on May 5, 1873, fixed both their [[currency|currencies]] against [[gold standard|gold]] [[Par value|at par]] to each other. [[Norway]], governed in union with Sweden, entered the monetary union two years later in 1875 by pegging its currency to gold at the same level as Denmark and Sweden (.403&amp;nbsp;grams).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The monetary union proved one of the few tangible results of the [[Scandinavist]] political movement of the 19th century.

The union provided fixed exchange-rates and stability in monetary terms, but the member-countries continued to issue their own separate currencies. In an outcome not initially foreseen, the perceived security led to a situation where the formally separate currencies circulated on a basis of &quot;as good as&quot; the [[legal tender]] virtually throughout the entire area.

The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 brought an end to the monetary union. Sweden abandoned the tie to gold on August 2, 1914, and without a fixed exchange rate the free circulation came to an end.

== The 20th century ==
=== 1901-1939 ===

In the early decades of the 20th century the new [[Det Radikale Venstre|Radical Party]] and the older [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre Party]] shared government. During this time women gained the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] (1915), and the United States of America purchased some of Denmark's colonial holdings: the three islands of [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St. John]], [[St. Croix]], and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[West Indies]]. The period also saw Denmark inaugurating important social and labour-market reforms, laying the basis for the {{As of|2008|alt=present}} [[welfare state]].

Denmark remained [[Neutral country|neutral]] during [[World War I]], but the conflict affected the country to a considerable extent. As its economy was heavily based on exports, the unrestricted German submarine warfare was a serious problem. Denmark had no choice but to sell many of its exports to Germany instead of overseas nations. Widespread [[war profiteer|profiteer]]ing took place, but commerce also suffered great disruption because of the conflict and because of the ensuing financial instability in Europe. Rationing was instituted, and there were food and fuel shortages. Following the defeat of Germany in the war (1918), the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) mandated the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], which resulted in the return of [[Northern Schleswig]] ({{As of|2008|alt=now}} [[Southern Jutland|South Jutland]]) to Denmark. The king and parts of the opposition grumbled that Prime Minister [[Carl Theodor Zahle]] (in office 1909-1910 and 1913–1920) did not use Germany's defeat to take back a bigger portion of the province, which Denmark had lost in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. The king and the opposition wanted to take over the city of [[Flensburg]], while the cabinet insisted on only claiming areas where a majority of Danes lived, which led to a plebiscite in the affected areas over whether they wanted to become a part of [[Denmark]] or remain within [[Germany]]. Believing that he had the support of the people, King Christian X used his [[reserve power]] to dismiss Zahle's cabinet, sparking the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]]. As a result of the Easter Crisis, the king promised to no longer interfere in politics. Although the [[Danish Constitution]] remained un-amended, Danish monarchs have stayed out of politics since then. The end of the war also prompted the Danish government to finish negotiating with [[Iceland]], resulting in Iceland becoming a sovereign [[Kingdom of Iceland|Kingdom]] on December 1, 1918 while retaining the Danish monarch as [[Head of State]].

In the [[Danish Folketing election, 1924|1924 Folketing election]] the [[Social Democrat]]s, under the charismatic [[Thorvald Stauning]], became Denmark's largest parliamentary political party, a position they maintained until 2001. Since the opposition still held a majority of the seats in the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]], Stauning had to co-operate with some of the right-wing parties, making the Social Democrats a more mainstream party. He succeeded in brokering an important deal in the 1930s which brought an end to the [[Great Depression]] in Denmark, and also laid the foundation for a welfare state.

=== World War II ===
{{main|Occupation of Denmark}}

[[Image:Christian X.jpg|left|thumb|During the German occupation, King Christian X became a powerful symbol of national sovereignty. This image dates from the King's birthday, 26 September 1940. Note the lack of a guard]]

Denmark declared its neutrality at the beginning of [[World War II]] and signed a non-aggression agreement with [[Nazi Germany]]. Nevertheless, Germany (so as to secure communications for its invasion of Norway) occupied Denmark on April 9, 1940, meeting limited resistance. British forces, however, [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|occupied]] the [[Faroe Islands]] (12 April 1940) and [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded]] [[Iceland]] (10 May 1940) in pre-emptive moves to prevent German occupation. Following a [[Icelandic referendum, 1944|plebiscite]], Iceland declared its independence on June 17, 1944 and became a republic, dissolving its union with Denmark.

The Nazi occupation of Denmark unfolded in a unique manner. The conditions of occupation started off very leniently (although the authorities banned [[Communist Party of Denmark|Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti]] (the Communist party) when the Wehrmacht [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941), and Denmark retained its own government. The new coalition government tried to protect the population from Nazi rule through compromise. The Germans allowed the Folketing to remain in session, the police remained under Danish control, and the German authorities stayed one step removed from the population. However, the Nazi demands eventually became intolerable for the Danish government, so in 1943 it resigned and Germany assumed full control of Denmark. After that point, an armed resistance movement grew against the occupying forces. Toward the end of the war, Denmark grew increasingly difficult for Germany to control, but the country remained under occupation until near the end of the war. On 4 May 1945 German forces in Denmark, North West Germany, and the Netherlands surrendered to the Allies. On 5 May 1945 British troops liberated Copenhagen. Three days later the war ended.

Denmark succeeded in smuggling most of its Jewish population to Sweden in 1943 when the Nazis threatened deportation; see [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]].

=== Post-war ===

In 1948 Denmark granted [[home rule]] to the [[Faroe Islands]]. 1953 saw further political reform in Denmark, abolishing the Landsting (the elected upper house), colonial status for [[Greenland]] and allowing female rights of succession to the throne with the signing of a new constitution.

After the war, with the perceived threat posed by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and the lessons of World War II still fresh in Danish minds, the country abandoned its policy of neutrality. Denmark became a charter-member of the [[United Nations]] in 1945 and one of the original members of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] in 1949 (though Denmark had originally tried to form an alliance only with Norway and Sweden). A [[Nordic Council]] later emerged with the aim of co-ordinating Nordic policy. Later, in a [[Danish European Communities membership referendum, 1972|referendum in 1972]], Danes voted in favour of joining the [[European Community]], the predecessor of the [[European Union]], and Denmark became a member on 1 January 1973. Since then, Denmark has proven a hesitant member of the European community, opting out of many proposals, including the [[Euro]] which it rejected in a [[Danish euro referendum, 2000|referendum in 2000]]. During recent years, however, traditionally eurosceptical attitudes have mellowed.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this claim|date=May 2012}}
