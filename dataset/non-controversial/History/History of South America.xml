The '''history of South America''' is the study of the past, particularly the written record, oral histories, and traditions, passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere and (chiefly) southern hemisphere. South America has a history that spans a wide range of human cultural and civilizational forms. While millennia of independent development were interrupted by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization drive of the late 15th century and the demographic collapse that followed, the continent's ''mestizo'' and indigenous cultures remain quite distinct from those of their colonizers. Through the trans-Atlantic [[slave trade]], South America (especially Brazil) became the home of millions of people in the [[African diaspora]]. The mixing of races  led to new social structures. The tensions between colonial countries in Europe, indigenous peoples and escaped slaves shaped South America from the 16th through the 19th Centuries. With the revolution for independence from Spanish crown during the 19th century, South America underwent yet more social and political changes among them [[nation building]] projects, European immigration waves, increased trade, colonization of hinterlands, and wars about territory ownership and [[power balance]], the reorganization of Indian rights and duties, liberal-conservative conflicts among the ruling class, and the subjugation of Indians living in the states frontiers, that lasted until the early 1900s.

==Pre-Columbian era==
{{Main|Pre-Columbian South America}}

===Agriculture and domestication of animals===
The Americas are thought to have been first inhabited by people crossing the [[Bering Land Bridge]] from Asia, which is now the [[Bering Strait]]. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continent.

The first evidence for the existence of agricultural practices in South America dates back to circa 6500 BCE, when [[potato]]es, [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a staple foodstuff today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Patrick 2005. pp. 25&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

South American cultures began domesticating llamas and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BCE. These animals were used for both transportation and meat.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Patrick 2005. pp. 25&quot;/&gt; Guinea pigs were also domesticated as a food source at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies''. New York: Norton, 1999 pp.100&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 BCE, many agrarian village communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast which helped to establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Patrick 2005. pp. 25&quot;/&gt; The food crops were [[quinoa]], [[maize|corn]], [[lima bean]]s, [[common bean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[manioc]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[oca]] and [[squash (plant)|squashes]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies''. New York: Norton, 1999 (pp. 126-127)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cotton]] was also grown and was particularly important as the only major fiber crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Patrick 2005. pp. 25&quot;/&gt;

The earliest permanent settlement as proved by ceramic dating dates to 3500 BC by the [[Valdivia Culture|Valdivia]] on the coast of Ecuador. Other groups also formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were the Chibchas (or &quot;Muiscas&quot; or &quot;Muyscas&quot;) and the Tairona, of Colombia, the cañari of Ecuador, the Quechuas of Peru, and the Aymaras of Bolivia were the 3 most important sedentary Indian groups in South America. In the last two thousand years there may have been contact with [[Polynesia]]ns across the South Pacific Ocean, as shown by the [[Sweet_potato#Origin.2C_distribution_and_diversity|spread]] of the sweet potato through some areas of the Pacific, but there is no genetic legacy of human contact.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Kerry R., ''The Quest for Origins'', Penguin Books, 2003, ISBN 0-14-301857-4, pp 81, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cañaris===
[[File:Ingapirca Canari structures.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ingapirca]], [[Ecuador]], Caħari ruins: astronomical stone (left), tomb (right) and reconstructed house (background).]]
[[File:Chibchan languages distribution.png|thumb|right|220px|Distribution of the [[Chibcha language|chibchan languages]]]]
The [[Cañaris]] were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of Cañar and Azuay. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and religious belief. Most of their remains were either burned or destroyed from attacks by the Inca and later the Spaniards. Their old city &quot;Guapondelig&quot;, was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of Tomipamba, and later by the Colonial city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuenca.com.ec/cuencanew/node/4&lt;/ref&gt; The city was also believed to be the site of [[El Dorado]], the [[city of gold]] from the mythology of Colombia. The Cañaris were most notable to have repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui. It is said that the Inca strategically married the cañari princes Paccha to conquer the Cañaris. Many of their descendants are still present in Cañar with a reasonable amount not having mixed and have been reserved from becoming [[mestizo]]s.

===Chibchas===
The [[Chibcha language|Chibcha linguistic]] communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the Pre-Hispanic Colombian cultures. By the 3rd century CE, the Chibchas had established their civilization in the northern Andes. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now Panama and the high plains of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Sierra]] of Colombia. The areas that they occupied were the Departments of [[Santander Department|Santander]], [[Norte de Santander Department|Norte de Santander]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], which were also the areas where the first farms were developed. Centuries later it was in the area of these departments where the independence movement originated and the first industries were developed. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. They represented the most populous zone between the Mexica and Inca empires. Next to the [[Quechuas|Quechua]] of Peru and Ecuador and the Aymara in Bolivia, the Chibchas of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia were the most striking of the sedentary indigenous peoples in South America.

In Colombia's Eastern Sierra, the Chibchas were composed of several tribes who spoke the same language (Chibchan). Among them: [[Muiscas]], [[Guane culture|Guanes]], [[Lache people|Laches]] and [[Chitareros]].

===Amazon===
{{see also|Amazon Rainforest#History}}
[[File:Fazenda Colorada.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Geoglyphs on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest.]]
For a long time, it was believed that those inland dwellers were sparsely populated hunter-gatherer tribes. Archeologist [[Betty J. Meggers]] was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book ''Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise''. However, recent archeological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. From the 1970s, numerous [[geoglyph]]s have been discovered on deforested land dating between 0–1250 AD, leading to claims about [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html?_r=1|title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon’s Lost World|author=Simon Romero|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's ''[[Unnatural Histories (TV series)|Unnatural Histories]]'' claimed that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine [[wilderness]], has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as [[forest gardening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=''BBC Four''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to travel the length of the [[Amazon River]] was [[Francisco de Orellana]] in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=A|title=Explorers of the Amazon|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1994|isbn=0-226-76337-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC documentary ''Unnatural Histories'' presents evidence that Francisco de Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that an advanced civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at [[Marajoara culture|Marajó]], and inland dwellers.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{cite book|title=Tropical Rainforests|author=Chris C. Park|page=108|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4WQf6RZAiKcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the population  had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.&lt;ref name=park /&gt;

One of the main pieces of evidence is the existence of the fertile [[Terra preta]] (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest. It is now widely accepted that these soils are a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this soil allowed [[agriculture]] and [[silviculture]] in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;The influence of human alteration has been generally underestimated, reports Darna L. Dufour: &quot;Much of what has been considered natural forest in Amazonia is probably the result of hundreds of years of human use and management.&quot; &quot;Use of Tropical Rainforests by Native Amazonians&quot;, ''BioScience'' 40, no. 9 (October 1990):658. For an example of how such peoples integrated planting into their nomadic lifestyles, see Rival, Laura, 1993. &quot;The Growth of Family Trees: Understanding Huaorani Perceptions of the Forest&quot;, Man 28(4):635-652.&lt;/ref&gt; In the region of the [[Xinguanos]] tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the [[University of Florida]]. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Andean civilizations===

====Caral Supe====
[[File:Caral 1.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Caral]]]]
[[File:Moche jt01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The ancient city of [[Moche]] with the &quot;Huaca del Sol&quot; in the background]]
The [[Caral|Caral Supe civilization]] is among the oldest civilizations in the Americas, going back to 27th century BCE. It is noteworthy for having absolutely no signs of warfare. It was contemporary with urbanism's rise in [[Mesopotamia]].

====Norte Chico====
On the north-central coast of present-day Peru, the [[Norte Chico civilization]] emerged around the time of Caral-Supe civilization.

====Chavín====
The [[Chavín culture|Chavín]], a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 to 300 BCE.

====Moche====
The [[Moche]] thrived on the north coast of Peru 2000–1500 years ago. The heritage of the Moche comes down to us through their elaborate burials, recently excavated by UCLA's [[Christopher B. Donnan]] in association with the National Geographic Society.
Skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people who traded with faraway peoples, like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Almost everything we know about the Moche comes from their ceramic pottery with carvings of their daily lives. We know from these records that they practiced human sacrifice, had blood-drinking rituals, and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as fellatio).

====Tiwanaku====
The [[Tiwanaku]] were settled in Bolivia in around 400 BC.

====Inca====
Holding their capital at the great puma-shaped city of [[Cuzco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', or &quot;the land of the four regions&quot;, in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[brain surgery]] in Inca civilization. The Incas had no written language, but used [[quipu]], a system of knotted strings, to record information.

==European colonization==
Before the arrival of Europeans, an estimated 30 million people lived in South America.

In 1493, the papal bull [[Inter caetera]] was the third of a series that paved the way for the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] and [[Missionary#Catholic missions|Catholic mission]]s in the [[New World]], authorizing to take possession of non-Christian lands and encouraging the enslavement of the non-Christian people of Africa and the Americas.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLove062007&quot;&gt;David A. Love, ''[http://www.alternet.org/story/54407/ Pope Bendedict Argues Catholic Church 'Purified' Indigenous Peoples]'' posted on ''[[AlterNet]]'' June 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Spainport.GIF|left|thumb|230px|The imaginary lines of the Treaty of Tordesilhas.]] --&gt;
In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime powers of that time, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesilhas]] on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west. Through the treaty they agreed that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries. The treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[League (unit)|leagues]] west of [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (which is now known to include most of the South American soil), would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. Because accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were not possible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.

European diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]] and [[typhus]]) to which the native populations had no resistance decimated the American population, as well as cruel systems of forced labor (such as [[encomienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mita]]) under Spanish control. Following this, African [[slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunity to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

The Spaniards were committed to converting their American subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end. However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful; American groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their traditional beliefs. The Spaniards did not impose their language to the degree they did their religion. In fact, the missionary work of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl]], and [[Guarani language|Guarani]] actually contributed to the expansion of these American languages, equipping them with writing systems.

Eventually the natives and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[Mestizo]] class. Mestizos and the native Americans were often forced to pay unfair taxes to the Spanish government (although all subjects paid taxes) and were punished harshly for disobeying their laws. Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers. This included a great number of gold and silver sculptures, which were melted down before transport to Europe.

==17th and 18th Centuries==
In 1616, the Dutch, attracted by the legend of El Dorado, founded a fort in Guyana and established three colonies: [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]], and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]].

In 1624 France attempted to settle in the area of modern day [[French Guiana]], but was forced to abandon it in the face of hostility from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who viewed it as a violation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. However French settlers returned in 1630 and in 1643 managed to establish a settlement at [[Cayenne]] along with some small-scale plantations.

Since the sixteenth century there were some movements of discontent to Spanish and Portuguese colonial system. Among these movements, the most famous being that of the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], slaves who escaped their masters and in the shelter of the forest communities organized free communities. Attempts to subject them by the royal army was unsuccessful, because the Maroons had learned to master the South American jungles. In a royal decree of 1713, the king gave legality to the first free population of the continent: Palenque de San Basilio in Colombia today, led by [[Benkos Bioho]]. Brazil saw the formation of a genuine African kingdom on their soil, with the [[Palmares (quilombo)|Quilombo of Palmares]].

Between 1717 and 1735, the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|II Comunera Revolution]] of Paraguay arose, because of discontent over the Spanish colonial administration.
Between 1742 and 1756, was the insurrection of [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] in the central jungle of [[Peru]]. In 1780, the Viceroyalty of Peru was met with the insurrection of curaca Condorcanqui or [[Tupac Amaru II]], which would be continued by Tupac Catari in Upper Peru.

In 1763, the African [[Cuffy (person)|Cuffy]] led a revolt in Guyana which was bloodily suppressed by the Dutch.
In 1781, the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)]],  an insurrection of the villagers in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], was a popular revolution that united indigenous people and mestizos. The villagers tried to be the colonial power and despite the capitulation were signed, the Viceroy [[Manuel Antonio Flores]] did not comply, and instead ran to the main leaders [[José Antonio Galán]].
In 1796, [[Essequibo (colony)]] of the Dutch was taken by the British, who had previously begun a massive introduction of slaves.

During the eighteenth century, the figure of the priest, mathematician and botanist [[José Celestino Mutis]] (1732–1808), was delegated by the Viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Gongora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Nueva Granada]], which became known as the Botanical Expedition, which classified plants, wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of [[Santa Fé de Bogotá]].

On August 15, 1801, the Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reached Fontibón where Mutis, and began his expedition to New Granada, Quito. The meeting between the two scholars are considered the brightest spot of the botanical expedition. 
Humboldt also visited Venezuela, Mexico, United States, Chile, and Peru. 
His observations of temperature differences between the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Peru in different periods of the year, he discovered the cold currents moving from south to north up the coast of Peru, which was named in his honor the Humboldt Current.

Between 1806 and 1807, British military forces tried to invade the area of the Rio de la Plata, at the command of [[Home Riggs Popham]] and [[William Carr Beresford]], and [[John Whitelocke]]. The invasions were repelled, but powerfully affected the Spanish authority.

==Independence and 19th century==
[[Image:Karta sydamerika 1892.jpg|thumb|200px|left|South America in 1892]]

[[Image:Latin American independence countries.PNG|thumb|220px|Countries in the Americas by date of independence]]
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] ([[Greater Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]]), [[José de San Martín]] ([[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]), and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] ([[Chile]]) led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another. 

Unlike the Spanish colonies, the Brazilian independence came as an indirect consequence of the Napolionioc Invasions to Portugal - French invasion under General Junot led to the capture of [[Lisbon]] on 8 December 1807. In order not to lose its sovereignty, the Portuguese Court moved the capital from [[Lisbon]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], which was the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s capital between 1808 and 1821 and rose the relevance of [[Brazil]] within the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s framework. Following the Portuguese [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], and after several battles and skirmishes were fought in Pará and in Bahia, the [[heir apparent]] [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], son of King [[John VI of Portugal]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[emperor]] (He later also reigned as Pedro IV of Portugal). This was one of the most peaceful colonial independence ever seen in human history.

A struggle for power emerged among the new nations, and several further wars were soon fought thereafter. 

The first few wars were fought for supremacy in the northern and southern parts of the continent. The [[Gran Colombia – Peru War]] of the north and the [[Cisplatine War]] (between the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]]) ended in stalemates, although the latter resulted in the independence of [[Uruguay]] (1828). A few years later, after the break-up of Gran Colombia, the balance of power shifted in favor of the newly-formed [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836-1839). Nonetheless, this power structure proved temporary and shifted once more as a result of the Northern Peruvian State's victory over the Southern Peruvian State-Bolivia [[War of the Confederation]] (1836-1839), and the [[Argentine Confederation]]'s defeat in the [[Guerra Grande]] (1839-1852). 

Later conflicts between the South American nations continued to define their borders and power status. In the Pacific coast, Chile and Peru continued to exhibit their increasing domination, defeating Spain in the [[Chincha Islands War]]. Finally, after precariously defeating Peru during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1883), Chile emerged as the dominant power of the Pacific Coast of South America. In the Atlantic side, [[Paraguay]] attempted to gain a more dominant status in the region, but an alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay (in the resulting [[War of the Triple Alliance]], 1864-1870) ended Paraguayan ambitions. Thereupon, the [[Southern Cone]] nations of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile entered the 20th century as the [[ABC nations|major continental powers]].

A few countries did not gain independence until the 20th century:
* [[Panama]], from [[Colombia]], in 1903
* [[Guyana]], from the United Kingdom, in 1966.
* [[Suriname]], from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] control, in 1975
* [[Trinidad and Tobago]], from the United Kingdom, in 1962

[[French Guiana]] remains an overseas [[Departments of France|department]] of France.

South America, like many other continents, became a battlefield for the [[superpower]]s during the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned [[military dictatorship]]s. These detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the U.S. [[Cold War]] doctrine of &quot;National Security&quot; against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is now widespread. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued. [[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.

In recent years, with deep economic and social crisis provoked by neoliberal policies{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, the right wing lost appeal in the region (with the major exception being Colombia)&lt;ref name=&quot;FAff&quot;&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61702/jorge-g-castaneda/latin-americas-left-turn Foreignaffairs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the election of a sequence of left wing presidents began with [[Hugo Chávez]]' victory on the 1998 presidential election in Venezuela. As a matter of fact, ''[[The Nation]]'' described [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s victory in the 2010 Brazilian election as a defeat for the [[Washington Consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Rapoza. [http://www.thenation.com/article/155799/brazils-first-lady &quot;Brazil's First Lady&quot;]. ''The Nation''. November 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the move to the left, South America remains largely capitalist and is enjoying its best years of economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAff&quot; /&gt; The Brazilian GDP, for instance, is expected to grow 7.5% in 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;FAff&quot;/&gt; second only to the [[People's Republic of China]] in the world.

The list of left wing South American presidents is, by date of election, the following:

*1998: [[Hugo Chávez]], Venezuela
*1999: [[Ricardo Lagos]], Chile
*2002: [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]], Brazil
*2002: [[Lucio Gutiérrez]], Ecuador
*2003: [[Néstor Kirchner]], Argentina
*2004: [[Tabaré Vázquez]], Uruguay
*2005: [[Evo Morales]], Bolivia
*2006: [[Michelle Bachelet]], Chile
*2006: [[Rafael Correa]], Ecuador
*2007: [[Cristina Kirchner]], Argentina
*2008: [[Fernando Lugo]], Paraguay
*2009: [[José Mujica]], Uruguay
*2010: [[Dilma Rousseff]], Brazil
*2011: [[Ollanta Humala]], Peru

In 2008, the [[Union of South American Nations]] (USAN) was founded, revealing South American ambition of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This was seen by American political commentators as a pivotal moment in the loss of U.S. hegemony in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, Joshua. [http://www.counterpunch.org/sperber11042006.html &quot;How the US Lost Latin America&quot;]. [[CounterPunch]]. November 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Noam Chomsky]], USAN represents that &quot;for the first time since the European conquest, Latin America began to move towards integration&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}} Giovana Sanchez.
