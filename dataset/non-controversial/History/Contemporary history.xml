{{Human history}}
'''Contemporary history''' describes the [[historical period|period]] [[timeline|timeframe]] that is without any intervening time closely connected to the present day and is a certain perspective of [[modern history]]. The term &quot;contemporary history&quot; has been in use at least by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]] ''Edinburgh review,'' Volume 12 (1808) [http://books.google.com/books?id=szEeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA480 p. 480] (cf., There is this general distinction between contemporary history and all other history, —that the former is a witness, the latter a judge. The opinions of a contemporary author on the events which he records, are only then authority, when the impression made on a bystander happens to be a material part of the case; nor is this any exception to the maxim, that his business is to testify, not to lecture. On facts, however, he is paramount evidence; and that, not only in the age immediately succeeding him, but also, which is generally forgotten, to the latest times. The modern historian, who consults original authorities through the-medium of some later predecessor, descends from the character of a judge to that of a faithful reporter of decisions.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the widest context of this use, contemporary history is that part of history still in '''living memory'''. Based on [[human lifespan]], contemporary history would extend for a period of [[approximation|approximately]] 80 years. Obviously, this concept shifts in absolute terms as the generations pass. In a narrower sense, &quot;contemporary history&quot; may refer to the history remembered by most adults currently living, extending to about a [[generation]] or roughly 30 years. From the perspective of the 2010s, thus, contemporary history would include the period since the mid-to-late 20th century, including the [[postwar period]] and the [[Cold War]]. 

The ''present age'' possesses a distinct character of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contemporary History of the World&quot;&gt;Grosvenor, Edwin A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=DVQPAAAAYAAJ Contemporary History of the World]. New York and Boston: T.Y. Crowell &amp; Co, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldometers.info/ worldometers.info], Real Time Statistics Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been [[Timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific accomplishments]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian achievements]] during the present age (''i.e.'', the [[modern age]]), the contemporary era has seen scientific and political progress, not so much in what has been originated as by what has been developed. Notable achievements have been those such as the redefinition of nationalities and nations and the ongoing technological advances that marked the 20th century. 

In contemporary Science and Technology, history notably includes [[History of spaceflight|spaceflight]], [[nuclear technology]], [[laser]] and [[semiconductor]] technology and the beginning [[Information Age]], and the development of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]], and the development of [[particle physics]] and the [[Standard Model]] of [[history of quantum field theory|quantum field theory]]. 

In contemporary [[African history]], there was [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid in South Africa]] and its [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|abolition]], [[Decolonization of Africa|Decolonization]], and a multitude of wars on the continent.

In contemporary [[Asian history]], there was the [[History of the People's Republic of China|formation of the People's Republic of China]], [[Indian independence]], the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] wars, the ongoing [[Afghan civil war]], and the [[United States Forces Japan|stationing of US Forces in Japan]] and [[U.S. 8th Army|in South Korea]]. In the Middle East, there was the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], the conflict between [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Islamism]], and the (still ongoing) [[Arab Spring]].
In contemporary [[European history]], there were the [[Revolutions of 1989]] which contributed to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and the ongoing process of [[European integration]].

At the turn of the 19th to 20th century, the world saw a series of great conflagrations, World War I and World War II. Near the end of the first great war, there were a series of [[Russian Revolution]]s and a [[Russian Civil War]]. In between the great wars, the 1920s saw a great rise in prosperity where progress and new technology took hold of the world, but this was soon ended by the [[Great Depression]]. During this time, the [[League of Nations]] was formed to deal with global issues, but failed to garner enough support by the leading powers and a series of crises once again lead the world into another epoch of violence.

Notable events of this modern period of [[universal history]] include two [[World war]]s and the [[Cold War]], characterized by the dispute for world influence between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].

The [[Cold War]] began in 1945 and lasted into 1989. The [[Space Age]] was concurrent with this time, encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. [[Pax Americana]] is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America and, in its contemporaneousness  connotations, the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.

The post-1945 world experienced the ''establishment and defense of democratic states''. Throughout post-1945 period, the Cold War was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The [[Soviet Union]] created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a [[Containment|containment policy]] of communism and forged alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. The conflict included defense spending, a [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and various [[proxy war]]s; the two superpowers never fought one another directly.

The post-1989 World saw the abolishment of totalitarian regimes of the Cold War and the abolishment of Cold War superpower [[client state]]s. By the [[Revolutions of 1989|Democratizing Revolutions of Eastern Europe]] in 1989 and the Cold War effectively ended by the [[Malta Summit]] on December 3, 1989. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolved]] on the last day of 1991. The &quot;post-Cold War regimes&quot; established were democratic republics, not the [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] republics.

In South America, military regimes supported by the [[CIA]], such as seen in the [[United States intervention in Chile]], give way.&lt;!--Pinochet regime collapsed in 1990--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In Southeast Asia, ''developmental dictatorships''&lt;!-- such as [[Philipine]] (in 1986), [[Indonesia]] (in 1998)--&gt; were overthrown by uprising of people.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Information age and computers===

[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|A Visualization of the various routes through a portion of the Internet. Partial map of the Internet based in 2005.]]
The [[Information Age]] or Information Era, also commonly known as the Age of the Computer, is an idea that the current age will be characterized by the ability of individuals to transfer information freely, and to have instant access to knowledge that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously. The idea is heavily linked to the concept of a [[Digital Age]] or [[Digital Revolution]], and carries the ramifications of a shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based around the manipulation of information. The period is generally said to have begun in the latter half of the 20th century, though the particular date varies. The term began its use around the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has been used up to the present with the availability of the Internet.

During the late 1990s, both [[Internet directory|Internet directories]] and [[search engine]]s were popular—[[Yahoo!]] and [[Altavista]] (both founded 1995) were the respective industry leaders. By late 2001, the directory model had begun to give way to search engines, tracking the rise of [[Google]] (founded 1998), which had developed new approaches to [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevancy ranking]]. Directory features, while still commonly available, became after-thoughts to search engines. Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s (decade), was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first.

&quot;[[Web 2.0]]&quot; is characterized as facilitating communication, [[information sharing]], [[interoperability]], [[User-centered design]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techpluto.com/web-20-services/|title=Core Characteristics of Web 2.0 Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[collaboration]] on the [[World Wide Web]]. It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, [[Web service|hosted services]], and [[web application]]s. Examples include [[Social network service|social-networking sites]], [[video sharing|video-sharing sites]], [[wiki]]s, blogs, [[Mashup (digital)|mashup]]s and [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]].

While Asia has seen considerable economic development, China in particular has experienced immense growth, moving toward the status of a regional power and billion-consumer market. [[India]], along with other developing non-western countries, is also growing rapidly, and has begun integrating itself into the [[world economy]].

After China joined the [[World Trade Organization]], the standard of living in the country has improved significantly as China saw the reappearance of the middle class. Wealth disparity between East and the Western hinterlands continued to widen by the day, prompting government programs to &quot;develop the West&quot;, taking on such ambitious projects such as the [[Qinghai-Tibet Railway]]. The burden of education was greater than ever. Rampant corruption continued despite Premier Zhu's anti-corruption campaign that executed many officials.

By the beginning of 2009, about 300 million people in India – equivalent to the entire population of the entire United States – have [[Poverty in India|escaped extreme poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/blog/show/131810.html|title=What Slumdog Millionaire can teach Americans about economic stimulus|year=2008|author=Nick Gillespie|publisher=Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits of India's economic liberalization policies reached their peak in 2007, with India recording its highest GDP growth rate of 9%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html#Econ CIA Factbook: Economy]. cia.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; With this, India became the second fastest growing major economy in the world, next only to China.&lt;ref name=&quot;astaire&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf|title=The India Report|publisher=Astaire Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report states that the average growth rate 7.5% will double the average income in a decade, and more reforms would speed up the pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;oecdindia2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf|title=Economic survey of India 2007: Policy Brief|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the [[Next Eleven]] economies are Asian countries. A number of [[newly industrialized countries]] have emerged from Asia, including China, India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.

===European Union and Russian Federation===

In Europe, the [[European Union]] is a [[geo-political]] union founded upon numerous treaties and has undergone expansions to include a majority of states in Europe. Its origins date back to the post-World War II era, in particular the foundation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in Paris 1951, following the &quot;[[Schuman declaration]]&quot;, or the [[Treaties of Rome]] establishing the [[European Economic Community]] and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. Both these bodies are now part of the European Union, which was formed under that name in 1993.

In the [[History of post-Soviet Russia|Post-communist period]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] became an independent country. Russia was the largest of the fifteen republics that made up the [[Soviet Union]], accounting for over 60% of the GDP and over half of the Soviet population. [[Russians]] also dominated the Soviet military and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Thus, Russia was widely accepted as the Soviet Union's [[successor state]] in diplomatic affairs and it assumed the USSR's permanent membership and veto in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]; see ''[[Russia and the United Nations]]''. Russia today shares many continuities of political culture and social structure with its tsarist and Soviet past.

Concerning [[NATO–Russia relations]], the [[NATO-Russia Council]] has been an official diplomatic tool for handling security issues and joint projects between NATO and Russia, involving &quot;consensus-building, consultations, joint decisions and joint actions.&quot;&lt;ref name='NATO-Russia council Statement'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/htm/en/documents28may02_2.shtml NATO-Russia council Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='nato-russia'&gt;[http://www.nato.int/issues/nato-russia/topic.html NATO's relations with Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Joint decisions and actions&quot;, taken under NATO-Russia Council agreements, include fighting terrorism,&lt;ref name='NATO-Russia on terrorism'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/htm/en/documents28jul08.shtml NATO-Russia council on Terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NATO-Russia on terrorism 2'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/HTM/EN/news_10.shtml NATO-Russia to practise anti-terrorist response]&lt;/ref&gt; military cooperation (joint military exercises&lt;ref name='NATO-Russia joint manoeuvres'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/htm/en/documents13jun08.shtml RFS and NATO ships joint manoeuvres]&lt;/ref&gt; and personnel training&lt;ref name='Joint NATO-Russia Excersises'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/HTM/EN/news_14.shtml Allies and Russia attend U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accident Exercise]&lt;/ref&gt;), cooperation on Afghanistan, industrial cooperation, cooperation on defence interoperability, non-proliferation, and other areas.&lt;ref name='NRC factsheet'&gt;[http://www.nato-russia-council.info/HTM/EN/Copy%20of%20news_41.shtml Fact sheet of NATO-Russia Council practical cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; Because NATO and Russia have similar ambitions and mutual challenges, the NATO-Russia Council is seen by both sides as effective at building diplomatic agreements between all parties involved.

===Late contemporary times : terrorism and warfare===

Major political developments in the 2000s (decade) for the Western World and the Middle East revolved around [[modern terrorism|recent modern terrorism]], the [[War on Terrorism]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]], and the [[Iraq War]].

[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Trade Center]] on fire and the [[Statue of Liberty]].]]
The [[September 11 attacks]] were a series of coordinated [[suicide attack]]s by [[Al-Qaeda]] upon the United States on September 11, 2001. On that morning, 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four commercial passenger [[jet airliner]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecCounc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Security Council Condemns, 'In Strongest Terms', Terrorist Attacks on the United States|publisher=United Nations|date=September 12, 2001|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/SC7143.doc.htm|accessdate=September 11, 2006|quote=The Security Council today, following what it called yesterday’s &quot;horrifying terrorist attacks&quot; in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, unequivocally condemned those acts, and expressed its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families and to the people and Government of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bin Laden claims responsibility for 9/11 | publisher=CBC News | date= October 29, 2004 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/10/29/binladen_message041029.html | accessdate =January 11, 2009 |quote=Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden appeared in a new message aired on an Arabic TV station Friday night, for the first time claiming direct responsibility for the 2001 attacks against the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City, killing everyone on board and many others working in the buildings. Both buildings collapsed within two hours, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], just outside of Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]] in rural [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C. Major terrorist events after the September 11, 2001 Attacks include the [[Moscow Theatre Siege]], the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]], the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], the [[July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]], the [[October 29 2005 Delhi bombings|October 2005 New Delhi bombings]], and the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai Hotel Siege]].

The United States responded to the September 11, 2001 attacks by launching a &quot;Global War on Terrorism&quot;, invading [[Afghanistan]] to depose the [[Taliban]], who had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists, and enacting the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]]. Many other countries also strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. The 'Global War on Terrorism' is the military, political, legal and ideological conflict against [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[Islamic militants]] since the 2001 attacks.

[[File:US Army Afghanistan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[U.S. Army]] troops in [[Kunar province]]]]
The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] began in late 2001 and was launched by the United States with the United Kingdom, and [[NATO]]-led, UN authorized [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in response to the September 11 attacks. The aim of the invasion was to find the whereabouts of [[Osama bin Laden]] and other high-ranking al-Qaeda members and put them on trial, to destroy the whole organization of [[al-Qaeda]], and to remove the [[Taliban]] regime which supported and gave safe harbor to al-Qaeda. The [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush administration policy]] and the [[Bush Doctrine]] stated forces would not distinguish between terrorist organizations and nations or governments that harbor them. Two military operations in Afghanistan are fighting for control over the country. [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) is a United States combat operation involving some coalition partners and currently operating primarily in the eastern and southern parts of the country along the [[Pakistan]] border. The second operation is the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), which was established by the [[UN Security Council]] at the end of 2001 to secure [[Kabul]] and the surrounding areas.

====Israeli–Palestinian conflict====

{{Main|Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
{{See also|History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|thumb|left|Israel, West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights]]
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] has been an ongoing dispute between [[Israelis]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/v3_ip_timeline/html/default.stm A History of Conflict:introduction], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; It forms part of the wider [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. The [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], is the consensus solution that is currently under discussion by the key parties to the conflict.

A two-state solution envisions two separate [[sovereign state|states]] in the Western portion of the historic region of [[Palestine]], one Jewish and another [[Arab]] to solve the conflict. According to the idea, the Arab inhabitants would be given citizenship by the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|new Palestinian state]]; [[Palestinian refugees]] would likely be offered such citizenship as well. Arab citizens of present-day Israel would likely have the choice of staying with Israel, or becoming citizens of the new Palestine.

At present, a considerable majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, prefer the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/933214.html Just another forgotten peace summit].&quot; ''Haaretz.com''.

''[[The Case for Peace|The Case for Peace: How the Arab-Israeli Conflict Can Be Resolved]]''.

There are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments. Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a [[Views of the Arab-Israeli conflict|wide variety of views and opinions]]. This serves to highlight the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also amongst themselves. In 2003, the Palestinian side was fractured by [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|conflict between the two major factions]]: [[Fatah]], the traditionally dominant party, and its more electoral challenger, [[Hamas]].

====Great Recession====
{{main|Late-2000s recession}}
In the beginning of the 2000s (decade), there was a global rise in prices in [[commodities]] and [[house|housing]], marking an end to the [[late-twentieth century commodities recession|commodities recession of 1980–2000]]. The US mortgage-backed securities, which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world and a broad based credit boom fed a global speculative bubble in real estate and equities. The financial situation was also affected by a sharp increase in oil and food prices. The collapse of the American [[housing bubble]] caused the values of [[security (finance)|securities]] tied to [[real estate pricing]] to plummet thereafter, damaging financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jarvis, Jonathan.

The [[global recession]] occurred in an economic environment characterized by various imbalances. This global recession has resulted in a sharp drop in [[international trade]], rising unemployment and slumping commodity prices. The recession renewed interest in [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian economic ideas]] on how to combat recessionary conditions. However, various industrial countries continued to undertake [[austerity]] [[Economic policy|policies]] to cut [[Government budget deficit|deficits]], reduced [[Government spending|spending]], as opposed to following Keynesian theories.

From late 2009 [[European sovereign debt crisis]], fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed among investors concerning rising government debt levels across the globe together with a wave of downgrading of government debt of certain European states. Concerns intensified early 2010 and thereafter making it difficult or impossible for sovereigns to re-finance their debts. On May 9, 2010, Europe's Finance Ministers approved a rescue package worth €750 billion aimed at ensuring financial stability across Europe. The [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) was a special purpose vehicle financed by members of the eurozone to combat the European sovereign debt crisis. In October 2011 eurozone leaders agreed on another package of measures designed to prevent the collapse of member economies. The three most affected countries, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, collectively account for six percent of eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP).

====Arab Spring====
{{main|Arab Spring}}
In the Middle East and North Africa, a series of protests and demonstrations calling for democracy and freedom across the region started on December 18, 2010 and became known as the [[Arab Spring]]. The protests, uprisings and revolutions brought about the overthrow of the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian]] and [[Libyan civil war|Libyan]] governments and the [[2011–2012 Yemeni revolution|resignation of Yemen's President]]. A major [[Syrian civil war|uprising is ongoing in Syria]]. The period of political liberalization also affected countries that were not strictly part of the [[Arab world]].

{{See also|Future|Timeline of the near future}}

The world is currently in the [[third millennium]]. The 21st century is the current century of the [[Christian Era]] or [[Common Era]] in accordance with the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It began on January 1, 2001 and will end December 31, 2100. &lt;!-- 2001 and 2100 are the correct years, NOT 2000 or 2099.  There was no year zero. --&gt; The 2010s, or ''The Tens'', decade runs from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019.

The present is the time that is associated with the events [[perception|perceived]] directly,&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, E. C., &amp; Carus, P. (1890). [http://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ The Monist]. La Salle, Ill. [etc.]: Published by Open Court for the Hegeler Institute. page 443.&lt;/ref&gt; not as a recollection or a speculation. It is often represented as a [[hyperplane]] in [[space-time]],&lt;ref&gt;Sattig, T. (2006). [http://books.google.com/books?id=qYNv2zpHOmwC The language and reality of time]. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; often called ''now'', although modern [[mathematical physics]] demonstrates that such a hyperplane can not be defined uniquely for observers in [[relative motion]] (which negates the concept of [[absolute time and space]]). The present may also be viewed as a duration (see ''[[specious present]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;JamesW&quot;&gt;James, W. (1893). [http://books.google.com/books?id=JLcAAAAAMAAJ The principles of psychology]. New York: H. Holt and Company. Page 609.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodder, A. (1901).

The third millennium is the third period of one thousand years. As this millennium is currently in progress, only its first decade, the 2000s (decade), can be the subject of the conventional historian's attention. The remaining part of the 21st century and longer-term trends are currently researched by [[futures studies]], an approach that uses various models and several methods (such as &quot;[[forecasting]]&quot; and &quot;[[backcasting]]&quot;). Ever since the invention of history, people have searched for &quot;lessons&quot; that might be drawn from its study, on the principle that to understand the past is potentially to control the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert V. Daniels, &quot;History&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986 ed., vol. 14, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; A famous quote by [[George Santayana]] has it that &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, &quot;The Life of Reason&quot;, Volume One, p. 82, BiblioLife, ISBN 978-0-559-47806-2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his monumental ''[[A Study of History|Study of History]]'', sought regularities in the rise and fall of [[civilization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], ''[[A Study of History]]'', vols. I–XII, Oxford University Press, 1934–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more popular vein, [[Will Durant|Will and Ariel Durant]] devoted a 1968 book, ''[[The Lessons of History]]'', to a discussion of &quot;events and comments that might illuminate present affairs, future possibilities... and the conduct of states.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant|Will and Ariel Durant]], ''[[The Lessons of History]]'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1968, prelude.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of history's lessons often tend to an excessive focus on historic detail or, conversely, on sweeping [[historiographic]] generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Eddins and Georg G. Iggers, &quot;History&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986 ed., vol. 14, pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Future Studies takes as one of its important attributes ([[epistemology|epistemological]] starting points) the on-going effort to analyze alternative futures. This effort includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plurality of the term &quot;futures&quot; in futurology denotes the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied.

Practitioners of the discipline previously concentrated on [[extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], economic or social [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, or on attempting to [[prediction|predict]] future trends, but more recently they have started to examine social [[system]]s and [[uncertainty|uncertainties]] and to build [[scenario planning|scenario]]s, question the worldviews behind such scenarios via the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others) create preferred visions of the future, and use backcasting to derive alternative implementation strategies. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research.&lt;ref&gt;For the multidisciplinary area of research focused at mathematical modeling of historical dynamics that can be applied to events, see [[Cliodynamics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-technological trends===
At the end of the 20th century, the world was at a major crossroads. Throughout the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Computers, the Internet, and other [[modern technology]] radically altered daily lives. Increased [[globalization]], specifically [[Americanization]], had occurred. While not necessarily a threat, it has caused anti-Western and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] feelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East. The English language has become a leading [[global language]], with people who did not speak it becoming increasingly disadvantaged.

A trend connecting economic and political events in North America, Asia, and the Middle East is the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which, along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs (see [[peak oil]]), and political turmoil, saw the price of gas and oil soar ~500% between 2000 and 2005. In some places, especially in Europe, gas could be $5 a gallon, depending on the currency. Less influential, but omnipresent, is the debate on Turkey's participation in the [[European Union]].

====Challenges and problems====
[[File:World distributionofwealth GDP and population by region.gif|thumb|right|World [[distribution of wealth]] and population in 2000.]]
In the contemporary era, several issues are faced in the world.

First of all, wealth is concentrated among the [[G8]] and Western [[industrialized nations]], along with several Asian nations and [[OPEC]] countries. The richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000 and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistribWealth&quot; /&gt; The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1% of global wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistribWealth&quot;&gt;Extensive statistics, many indicating the growing world disparity, are included in the available report, press releases, Excel tables and Powerpoint slides. See ''The World Distribution of Household Wealth''. James B. Davies, Susanna Sandstrom, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. December 5, 2006.

However, developing countries face many challenges, including the scale of the task to be surmounted, rapidly growing populations, and the need to protect the environment, and the cost that goes along with facing such challenges.

Secondly, disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such as [[SARS]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[Avian influenza|Bird Flu]] continued to spread quickly and easily. In poor nations, [[malaria]] and other diseases affected the majority of the population. Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The virus was becoming an [[AIDS in Africa|epidemic in southern Africa]]. Even problems with non-infectious diseases has been raised in the world – innovations in the technology in the western world, by the 1900th spread of sedentary lifestyle where TV, computers, fast food and elevator has caused obesity become a global challenge. This causes challenges on the global economy since obesity is linked to a broad kind of diseases. This problem has even been influenced previously famine parts of the world where obesity lives beside poverty.

Terrorism, dictatorship, and the [[nuclear proliferation|spread of nuclear weapons]] were also issues requiring immediate attention. Dictators such as [[Kim Jong-un]] in North Korea continue to possess nuclear weapons. The fear exist that not only are terrorists already attempting to get nuclear weapons, but that they have already obtained them.

====Climate change====
{{Main|Climate change}}
{{details|Effects of global warming}}

[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] reflects the notion of the modern [[climate]]. The changes of climate over the past century, have been [[attribution of recent climate change|attributed of to various factors]] which have resulted in a [[global warming]]. This warming is the increase in the [[Instrumental temperature record|average temperature]] of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the [[natural environment]] and [[civilization|human life]] are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Ice shelf#Ice shelf disruption|ice shelf disruption]] such as that of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], [[sea level rise]], changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;tar_wg2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Contribution of Working Group II to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/index.htm|publisher=IPCC|date=February 16, 2001|accessdate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other expected effects include water scarcity in some regions and increased precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, and adverse health effects from warmer temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McMichael AJ, Woodruff RE, Hales S|title=Climate change and human health: present and future risks|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9513|pages=859–69|year=2006|pmid=16530580|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It usually is impossible to connect specific weather events to human impact on the world. Instead, such impact is expected to cause changes in the overall distribution and intensity of weather events, such as changes to the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Broader effects are expected to include [[Glacier mass balance|glacial retreat]], [[Arctic shrinkage]], and worldwide [[sea level rise]]. Other effects may include changes in [[crop yields]], addition of new trade routes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Macey|title=Global warming opens up Northwest Passage|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/19/2037198.htm?section=business|publisher=ABC News|date=September 19, 2007|accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; species [[extinction risk from climate change|extinctions]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ar4syn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis report|work=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report|accessdate=February 3, 2009|date=February 5, 2007|publisher=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in the range of [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vectors]]. Until 2009, the Arctic ''[[Northwest Passage]]'' [[polar ice packs|pack ice]] prevented regular [[ship transport|marine shipping]] throughout most of the year in this area, but climate change has reduced the pack ice, and this [[Arctic shrinkage]] made the waterways more navigable.&lt;ref&gt;European Space Agency, “News: Satellites Witness Lowest Arctic Ice Coverage in History,” September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Warming 'opens Northwest Passage'&quot;.

====Contemporary technologies====
[[list of emerging technologies|Various emerging technologies]], the recent developments and convergences in various fields of technology, hold possible future impacts. [[Emerging technologies]] cover various cutting-edge developments in the emergence and convergence of technology, including transportation, information technology, [[biotechnology]], [[robotics]] and [[applied mechanics]], and [[material science]]. Their status and possible effects involve controversy over the degree of social impact or the viability of the technologies. Though, these represent new and significant developments within a field; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals.

After [[Space Shuttle]] ''Atlantis'' lands successfully at Kennedy Space Center after completing STS-135, concluding the shuttle program, NASA announces in 2011 that its [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] captured photographic evidence of possible liquid water on Mars during warm seasons. The Mars Science Laboratory [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], the most elaborate Martian exploration vehicle to date, is also launched that same year from the Kennedy Space Center.
