The '''Holy Roman Empire''' ({{lang-la|Imperium Romanum Sacrum}}, {{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich}}, {{lang-it|Sacro Romano Impero}}, {{lang-cs|Svatá říše římská}}, {{lang-sl|Sveto rimsko cesarstvo }}) was a varying complex of lands&lt;ref&gt;Holy Roman Empire. 2012. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 12 July 2012, from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire/10194/Additional-Reading&lt;/ref&gt; that existed from 962 to 1806 in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim Ehlers]]: ''Natio 1.5 Deutschland und Frankreich'', in: ''[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]'', Bd. 6, Sp. 1037&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; Its character changed during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]], when the power of the emperor gradually weakened in favour of the princes. In its last centuries, it had become quite close to a union of territories.

The empire's territory lies predominantly in [[Central Europe]] and at its peak included territories of the [[Kingdom of Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name=HRE-H-01&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/tag.php?id=877 Holy Roman Empire details from World Heritages site]&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its history, the Empire consisted of hundreds of [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|smaller sub-units]], [[principality|principalities]], [[duchy|duchies]], [[county|counties]], [[Free Imperial City|Free Imperial Cities]] and other domains.

The Holy Roman Empire explicitly proclaimed itself to be the successor of the [[Western Roman Empire]] under the doctrine of ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (&quot;transfer of rule&quot; via a succession of singular rulers vested with supreme power).&lt;ref&gt;Whaley 2011, pp. 17-20&lt;/ref&gt; In 962 [[Otto I]] was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] ({{lang-la|Imperator Romanus Sacer}}), although the Roman imperial title was first restored to [[Charlemagne]] by the [[Pope]] in 800. Otto was the first emperor of the realm who was not a member of the earlier [[Carolingian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Arbage, &quot;Otto I&quot;, in ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 810 [http://books.google.com/books?id=spKxJeHJgTAC&amp;pg=PA810&amp;dq=%22Otto+can+be+considered+the+first+ruler%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online]: &quot;Otto can be considered the first ruler of the Holy Roman empire, though that term was not used until the twelfth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The last Holy Roman Emperor was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who abdicated and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryce|first=James|title=The Holy Roman Empire|year=1889|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|page=1|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lvgsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=holy+roman+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ukRbT4CTGsm1gweT2oWiCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=holy%20roman%20empire&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The term ''sacrum'' (i.e., &quot;holy&quot; in the sense of &quot;consecrated&quot;) in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used from 1157, under [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] (&quot;Holy Empire&quot;; the form &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; is attested from 1254 onward).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Moraw, ''Heiliges Reich'', in: [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]], Munich &amp; Zurich: Artemis 1977–1999, vol. 4, col. 2025–2028.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was added to reflect Frederick's ambition to dominate Italy and the Papacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whaley17&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia, 1493-1648|editor= Joachim Whaley|year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1157, the realm was merely referred to as the '''Roman Empire'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson&quot;&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806,'' MacMillan Press 1999, London, page 2; [http://www.london.diplo.de/Vertretung/london/en/06/German_20History/Holy__Roman__Empire/Background__seite.html The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation] at the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in London website&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decree following the 1512 [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Cologne]], the name was officially changed to '''Holy Roman Empire of the [[Germans|German]] Nation''' ({{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation}}, {{lang-la|Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanicæ}}).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495-1806'', MacMillan Press 1999, London, page 2; [http://www.london.diplo.de/Vertretung/london/en/06/German_20History/Holy__Roman__Empire/Background__seite.html The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation] at the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in London website&lt;/ref&gt; This form was first used in a document in 1474, but then was used only in [[German literature]], otherwise was known as Holy Roman Empire ({{lang-la|Imperium Romanum Sacrum}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Whaley17&quot;/&gt;

The French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer [[Voltaire]] remarked sardonically:  &quot;This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Original text:  ''Ce corps qui s'appelait et qui s'appelle encore le saint empire romain n'était en aucune manière ni saint, ni romain, ni empire.'' In ''Essai sur l'histoire générale et sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations'', Chapter 70 (1756)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Carolingian forerunners===
{{Further|Carolingian Empire}}
The Holy Roman Empire looked to [[Charlemagne]], '''Charles the Great''', King of the [[Franks]], as its founder, who had been crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]] on Christmas Day in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Pagden | first = Percy | title = World's at War: The 2,500-Year Struggle Between East and West | publisher = Random House | year = 2008 | edition = First | page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Bryce | first = James | title = The Holy Roman Empire | publisher = Macmilan | year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Western Roman Empire]] was thus revived (Latin:  ''renovatio Romanorum imperii'') by transferring it to the Frankish king. This ''[[translatio imperii]]'' remained the basis for the Holy Roman Empire, at least in theory, until its demise in 1806.

The Carolingian imperial crown was initially disputed among the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] rulers of [[Western Francia]] and [[Eastern Francia]], with first the western king ([[Charles the Bald]]) and then the eastern ([[Charles the Fat]]) attaining the prize.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, after the death of Charles the Fat in 888, the Carolingian Empire broke asunder, never to be restored. According to [[Regino of Prüm]], each part of the realm elected a &quot;kinglet&quot; from its own &quot;bowels.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} After the death of Charles the Fat, those crowned Emperor by the [[Pope]] controlled only territories in Italy. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The last such Emperor was [[Berengar I]] of Italy who died in 924.

Around 900, East Francia saw the reemergence of autonomous [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] ([[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Lotharingia#Duchy_of_Lotharingia|Lotharingia]]). After the Carolingian king [[Louis the Child]] died without issue in 911, East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the realm but elected one of the dukes, [[Conrad of Franconia]], as ''Rex Francorum Orientalum''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} On his deathbed, Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival, [[Henry the Fowler|Henry of Saxony]] (r. 919–36), who was elected king at the Diet of [[Fritzlar]] in 919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry reached a truce with the raiding [[Magyars]] and in 933{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} won a first victory against them in the [[Battle of Riade]].

Henry died in 936 but his descendants, the [[Ottonian dynasty|Liudolfing (or Ottonian) dynasty]], would continue to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century. Henry's designated successor, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], was elected King in [[Aachen]] in 936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank|title=Dictionary of World Biography|volume=II|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overcame a series of revolts—both from an elder brother and from several dukes. After that, the king managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in administrative affairs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kings travelled from residence to residence (called [[Kaiserpfalz]]) to discharge affairs. However, each king preferred certain places, in Otto's case, the city of [[Magdeburg]]. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but Kings often had their sons elected during their lifetime, enabling them to keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century.

In 955, Otto won a decisive victory over the [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magill 1998 707&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank|title=Dictionary of World Biography|volume=II|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|page=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 951, Otto came to the aid of [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} the widowed queen of Italy, defeating her enemies. He then married her and took control over Italy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 962, Otto was crowned Emperor by the Pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magill 1998 707&quot;/&gt;  This date marks the historical beginning of the Holy Roman Empire as a territory. From then on, the affairs of the German kingdom were intertwined with those of Italy and the Papacy. Otto's coronation as Emperor made the German kings successors to the Empire of Charlemagne, which through ''[[translatio imperii]]'' also made them successors to Ancient Rome.

This also renewed the conflict with the [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Emperor in Constantinople]], especially after Otto's son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (r. 967–83) adopted the designation ''imperator Romanorum''. Still, Otto formed marital ties with the east, when he married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank|title=Dictionary of World Biography|volume=II|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|page=708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], focused his attention on Italy and Rome and employed widespread diplomacy but died young in 1002,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} to be succeeded by his cousin [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who focused on Germany.

When [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] died in 1024, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], first of the [[Salian|Salian Dynasty]], was then elected king in 1024 {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} only after some debate among dukes and nobles, which would eventually develop into the collegiate of [[prince-elector|Electors]].

====Investiture controversy====
Kings often employed bishops in administrative affairs and often determined who would be appointed to ecclesiastical offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barraclough 1984 101–134&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=o-393-30153-2|pages=101–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Cluniac Reforms]], this involvement was increasingly seen as inappropriate by the Papacy. The reform-minded [[Pope Gregory VII]] was determined to oppose such practices, leading to the [[Investiture Controversy]] with King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] (r. 1056–1106),&lt;ref name=&quot;Barraclough 1984 101–134&quot;/&gt; who repudiated the Pope's interference and persuaded his bishops to excommunicate the Pope, whom he famously addressed by his born name &quot;Hildebrand&quot;, rather than his regnal name &quot;Pope Gregory VII&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barraclough 1984 109&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=o-393-30153-2|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope, in turn, excommunicated the king, declared him deposed and dissolved the oaths of loyalty made to Henry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barraclough 1984 109&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1000-01&gt;{{cite web|title=History OF The Holy Roman Empire|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa35|publisher=historyworld|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king found himself with almost no political support and was forced to make the famous [[Walk to Canossa]] in 1077,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=o-393-30153-2|pages=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which he achieved a lifting of the excommunication at the price of humiliation.  Meanwhile, the German princes had elected another king, [[Rudolf of Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=o-393-30153-2|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry managed to defeat him but was subsequently confronted with more uprisings, renewed excommunication and even the rebellion of his sons. It was his second son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], who managed to reach an agreement with both the Pope and the bishops in the  1122 [[Concordat of Worms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=o-393-30153-2|pages=123–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political power of the Empire was maintained but the conflict had demonstrated the limits of any ruler's power, especially in regard to the Church, and robbed the king of the sacral status he had previously enjoyed. Both the Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the Empire.

====Hohenstaufen dynasty====
[[File:Adhemar de Monteil carries the Holy Lance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adhemar de Monteil]] carries the [[Holy Lance]].]]
When the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1138, the princes again aimed at checking royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, close relatives of the Salians, leading to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot;]] succeeded and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his—albeit diminished—possessions.

The Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia,'' formerly non-free service men, which Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[knights]], another basis of imperial power. Another important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace ([[Landfrieden]]) for all of the Empire, an attempt to (on the one hand) abolish private feuds not only between the many dukes, but on the other hand a means to tie the Emperor's subordinates to a legal system of jurisdiction and public prosecution of criminal acts — a predecessor of the modern concept of &quot;[[rule of law]]&quot;. Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities, both by the Emperor and the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, but also to concentrate economic power at strategic locations, while formerly cities only existed in the shape of either old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].

[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the Empire's &quot;Romanness&quot;, partly in an attempt to justify the Emperor's power independently of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to Justinian's [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy, but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia as well. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees and the investiture, the seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.

Frederick's policies were mainly aimed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159–81). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected [[Henry the Lion]] against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[Lübeck]]). Henry's support of Frederick's policies was only lackluster and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After his return to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all territories.

During the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands previously sparsely inhabited by [[West Slavs]] or uninhabited, by [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex [[phenomenon]] which should not be interpreted in terms of 19th century [[nationalism]]'s bias. By the eastward settlement the Empire's influence increased to eventually include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] – also due to intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. Also, the [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianise the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later [[Germans|German]] successor states of [[Prussia]] however never were part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1190, Frederick Barbarossa participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in [[Asia Minor]]. Under his son and successor, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy, when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, which resulted in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily. [[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the Empire and Sicily, now supported Sicily's king Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate - though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, though excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade|crusade]] in 1228, which however ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The conflict with the Pope endured who later supported the election of an anti-king in Germany.

Despite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of a central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralised state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: In the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick wanted to concentrate on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terræ,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.

[[File:Karel-IV..jpg|thumb|Czech lands during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV.]]]]
====Kingdom of Bohemia====
The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar I]] (bearing the title &quot;king&quot; since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II.]], confirming the royal title for Otakar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Czech king should be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor and thus it also became the capital of the Holy Roman Empire.

[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', in use as military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries.]]

====Interregnum====
After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[antiking|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition and the princes managed to consolidate their holdings and became even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the Guelph party, and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognised by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, the Interregnum ended with unanimous election of [[Rudolph I of Habsburg]], a minor pro-Staufen count.

====Changes in political structure====
{{Further|Medieval commune|Städtebund|Hanseatic League|Reichsfreiheit|}}
The 13th century also saw a general structural change in how land was administered, preparing the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]].

Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute for their lands. The concept of &quot;property&quot; began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: Whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. It is important to note, however, that jurisdiction at this time did not include legislation, which virtually did not exist until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.

It was during this time that the territories began to transform into predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were most identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'' Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Further|Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages}}

====Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufen====
[[File:HRR 14Jh.jpg|thumb|Holy Roman Empire from 1273–1378, and its principal royal dynasties]]
The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[Prince-elector]]s (''Kurfürsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] which was valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolises the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. Golden Bull also set the election system of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now had to be elected voice of the majority and not the consent of all of the seven electors. For electors the title was now granted hereditary, they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also their sons should know the imperial languages - [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptejteseknihovny.cz/uloziste/aba001/2007-2009/zlata-bula-karla-iv Zlatá bula Karla IV. na Ptejte se knihovny]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also revealed in the way the post-Hohenstaufen kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.

Instead, the kings, beginning with [[Rudolph I of Habsburg]], increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolph I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons.

With [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], the [[House of Luxembourg]] entered the stage. In 1312, Henry was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328–47) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. Interestingly, it was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.

====Imperial reform====
{{Further|Vehmic court}}
[[File:Imperial Circles 1512 en.png|thumb|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]
The &quot;constitution&quot; of the Empire was still largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433–37) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452–93) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''Hoftag'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. Even worse, dukes often went into feuds against each other that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.

Simultaneously, the Church was in a state of crisis too, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the legitimate [[Papacy|Pope]]) was only resolved at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–18); after 1419, much energy was spent on fighting the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, of which the Church and the Empire were the leading institutions, began to decline.

With these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently called for. During this time, the concept of &quot;reform&quot; emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'', to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.

When [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477-1488)|war against Hungary in 1486]] and at the same time had his son, later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] elected king, he was presented with the dukes' united demand to participate in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the Imperial Diet (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the Diet at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1495, after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire back some structure. Among others, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court); structures that would—to a degree—persist until the end of the Empire in 1806.

However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted and the new court actually began to function; only in 1512 would the [[Imperial Circle]]s be finalised. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to function in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. In this year, the Empire also received its new title, the ''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (&quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot;).

===Reformation and Renaissance===
{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}
{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}

In 1516, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], died.  Due to a combination of (1) the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon, which permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule; (2) the insanity of Charles's mother, [[Joanna of Castile]]; and (3) the insistence by his remaining grandfather, [[Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire|Maximilian I]], that he take up his royal titles, Charles initiated his reign in Castile and Aragon, a union which evolved into [[Spanish Crown|Spain]], in conjunction with his mother.  This ensured for the first time that all the realms of the Iberian peninsula (save for Portugal) would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown, with the founding territories retaining their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''.  The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign, and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived.  The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].

In addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles even began his reign in the Holy Roman Empire, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] initiated what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities—[[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Nuremberg]]—becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].
[[File:Carta itineraria europae 1520 waldseemueller watermarked.jpg|thumb|Carta itineraria europae (by [[Martin Waldseemüller|Waldseemüller]], 1520 dedicated to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V.)]]]]

From 1515 to 1523, the Habsburg government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the [[Frisians|Frisian]] peasant rebellion, led first by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and then by his nephew [[Wijerd Jelckama]]. The rebels were initially successful, but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were taken and decapitated in 1523. This was a blow for the Holy Roman Empire since many major cities were sacked and as many as 132 ships sunk (once even 28 in a single battle).

===Baroque period===
{{Main|Early Modern history of Germany|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}
{{Further|Baroque period|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years War}}
Charles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married Queen Mary of England, it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of the Protestant princes, although not [[Calvinism]], [[Anabaptism]], or [[Zwingliism]].

Germany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid that. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.

After Ferdinand died in 1564, his son Maximilian II became Emperor, and like his father, accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred classical Greek philosophy to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.

At the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire|Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, ending the western colonial Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The HRE army was half Polish/Lithuanian Commonwealth forces, mostly cavalry, and half Holy Roman Empire forces (German/Austrian), mostly infantry. The cavalry charge was the largest in the history of warfare.

[[File:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]

[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|Map of the Holy Roman Empire in 1789. The map is dominated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (brown) and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (blue), besides a large number of small states (many of them too small to be shown on map)]]
The actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], gave the territories almost complete [[sovereignty]]. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. Although its constituent states still had some restrictions—in particular, they could not form alliances against the Emperor — the Empire from this point was a powerless entity, existing in name only. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors instead focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.

===Modern period===
{{Main|18th century history of Germany}}

====Prussia and Austria====
{{Further|Austria–Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}
By the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were dependent on the position as [[Archduke of Austria|Archdukes of Austria]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.

====French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution====
{{Further|19th century history of Germany}}

From 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.
The [[German Mediatisation]] was the series of [[German mediatisation|mediatisations]] and [[Secularization|secularisations]] that occurred  in 1795–1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]].

''Mediatisation'' was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[monarchy]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. ''Secularisation'' was the redistribution to secular states of the secular lands held by an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]].

The Empire was formally dissolved on 6 August 1806 when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the Empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].

The Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This later served as the predecessor-state of modern Germany.

==Institutions==

The Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens—eventually hundreds—of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The only prince allowed to call himself &quot;king&quot; of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire&lt;/ref&gt; [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s and other rulers, collectively known as [[prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.

From the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence of the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the Emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, Emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]]  and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dissemination of their authority, but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.

===Imperial estates===
{{Main|Imperial State}}
The number of territories in the Empire was considerable, rising to approximately 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (&quot;little states&quot;) covered no more than a few square miles, or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (&quot;[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]&quot;).

An entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:
* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.
* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples include the three prince-archbishoprics: [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].
* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.

For a list of ''Reichsstände'' in 1792, see [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]].

===King of the Romans===
{{Main|King of the Romans}}
{{History_of Germany}}
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]
A prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex romanorum''; German: ''römischer König''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|elector]]s to seven: the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.

After being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy, or was in quarrel with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.

The Emperor had to be a man of good character over 18 years. All four of his grandparents were expected to be of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, though imperial law assumed that he was. He did not need to be a German (neither [[Alfonso X of Castile]] nor [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who contested for the crown in the 13th century, were themselves German). By the 17th century candidates generally possessed estates within the Empire.

===Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'')===
{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}
The Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was the legislative body of the Holy Roman Empire and theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two &quot;benches,&quot; one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into &quot;colleges&quot; by geography. Each college had one vote.

The third class was the [[Council of Imperial Cities]], which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully happy with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].

===Imperial courts===
The Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the [[Imperial Chamber Court|''Reichskammergericht'' (Imperial Chamber Court)]], established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.

===Imperial circles===
As part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defence, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (&quot;Circle Diet&quot;), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle.  Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].
