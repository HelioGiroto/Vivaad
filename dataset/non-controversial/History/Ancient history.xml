{{Ancient history}}
{{Human history and prehistory|200}}

'''Ancient history''' is the [[history|study of the written past]]&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, O. G. S. (1927). Antiquity. [Gloucester, Eng.]: Antiquity Publications [etc.]. (cf., History education in the United States is primarily the study of the written past. Defining history in such a narrow way has important consequences ...)&lt;/ref&gt; from the beginning of [[history of writing|recorded human history]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, with [[Cuneiform script]], the oldest discovered form of coherent writing, from the [[protoliterate]] period around the 30th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Jemdet Nasr period]], [[Kish tablet]]; see also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp 381-383&lt;/ref&gt; This is the beginning of ''history'', as opposed to [[prehistory]], according to the definition used by most [[historian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search - 3.0], &quot;History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to history in the [[Old World]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (First [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the founding of Rome in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I. S. (1906). Library of universal history: containing a record of the human race from the earliest historical period to the present time; embracing a general survey of the progress of mankind in national and social life, civil government, religion, literature, science and art.

Page 43. (cf. ... in the history of Europe, which marks both the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages, is the fall of the Western Roman Empire.)&lt;/ref&gt; the closure of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Literature |last=Hadas |first=Moses |year=1950 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-01767-7 |page=273 |page=327 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dOht3609JOMC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22end+of+antiquity%22+%2B+%22529%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22end%20of%20antiquity%22%20%2B%20%22529%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]],&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, C.

==Study==

A fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;GardnerP&quot;&gt;Gardner, P. (1892). New chapters in Greek history, historical results of recent excavations in Greece and Asia Minor. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. Page 1+.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;GardnerP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. S. (2002). The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel. The Biblical resource series. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. Page xxii - xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Few people were capable of writing histories, as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;Nadin, M. (1997). The civilization of illiteracy. Dresden: Dresden University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was one of the ancient world's most literate cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, W. V. (1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press. (cf. ... extent of literacy in the Roman Empire has been investigated, previous writers have generally concluded that a high degree of literacy ...)&lt;/ref&gt; but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist. Indeed, only a minority of the work of any major Roman historian has survived.

Historians have two major avenues which they take to better understand the ancient world: [[archaeology]] and the study of [[source text]]s. [[Primary source]]s are those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |publisher=Lib.umd.edu |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2010-01-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091230070606/http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html| archivedate= 30 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml &quot;Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources&quot;]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary sources have been distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handlin et al., Harvard Guide to American History (1954) 118-246&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons that an area undergoes an [[archaeological field survey]].
*''Artifacts found'': Locals have picked up artifacts.
*''Literary sources'': Old literary sources have provided archaeologists with clues about settlement locations that have not been archaeologically documented.
*''Oral sources'': In many locations, local stories contain some hint of a greater past, and there is often some truth to them.
*''Local knowledge'': In many cases, locals actually know where to find something that is of interest to archaeologists.
*''Previous surveys'': In some places, a survey was carried out in the past, and is recorded in an obscure academic journal.
*''Previous excavations'': Excavations carried out before the middle of the 20th century are notoriously poorly documented.
*''Lack of knowledge'': Many areas of the world have little known about the nature and organisation of past human activity.

===Source text===
{{Main|Source text}}
Most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians. Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].

The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], beginning with [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484 BC–ca.425 BC). [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179&quot;&gt;Cochrane, Charles Norris. ''Thucydides and the Science of History'', Oxford University Press, 1929. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179&quot;/&gt;

==Chronology==

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory}}
Prehistory is the period before [[Recorded history|written history]]. The [[early human migration]]&lt;ref&gt;H. Liu, F. Prugnolle, A. Manica, F. Balloux, ''A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History.'' The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 79 , Issue 2 , Pages 230 - 237&lt;/ref&gt; patterns in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] saw [[Homo erectus]] spread across Eurasia. The controlled use of [[fire]] occurred about 800 thousand years ago in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. Near 250 thousand years ago, [[Homo sapiens]] (modern humans) [[Human evolution|emerged]] in [[Africa]]. Around 70–60 thousand years ago, homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along a coastal route to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and reached [[Australia]]. About 50 thousand years ago, modern humans spread from [[Asia]] to the [[Near East]]. [[Europe]] was first reached by modern humans about 40,000 years ago. Finally, about 15 thousand years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the [[migration to the New World|migration to the Americas]] occurred.

The 10th millennium BC is the earliest given date for the [[Neolithic revolution|invention of agriculture]] and the beginning of the ancient era. [[Göbekli Tepe]] was erected by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[10th millennium BC]] (c. 11,500 years ago), before the advent of [[sedentism]].  Together with [[Nevali Cori|Nevalı Çori]], it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]]. In the 7th millennium BC, [[Jiahu]] culture began in [[China]]. By the 5th millennium BC, the late Neolithic civilizations saw the invention of the [[wheel]] and the spread of [[proto-writing]]. In the 4th millennium BC, the [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the [[Ukraine]]-[[Moldova]]-[[Romania]] region develops. By 3400 BC, &quot;proto-literate&quot; [[cuneiform]] is spread in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30th century BC, referred to as the [[Early Bronze Age II]], saw the beginning of the literate period in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. Around 27th century BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] and the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]] are founded, according to the earliest reliable [[regnal era]]s.

===Timeline of ancient history===
{{Main|Timeline of ancient history}}
{{Ancient chronology}}

====Middle to Late Bronze Age====
The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world.
In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html akkadian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H. G. (1921). [http://books.google.com/books?id=rTAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a The outline of history, being a plain history of life and mankind] New York: Macmillan company. Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded.
The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC.
The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began.

By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed, the beginning of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]].
Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is seen. The time between the 16th to 11th centuries around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed.

====Early Iron Age====
The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region.
During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster ISBN 0-7432-6441-X&lt;/ref&gt; By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was underway.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the [[Mannaeans]] Kingdom begins in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] forms in [[Mesopotamia]]. In 800 BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] are held.

====Classical Antiquity====
{{Main|Classical antiquity}}

''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]] centered around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which begins roughly with the earliest-recorded [[Greek language|Greek]] poetry of [[Homer]] (9th century BC), and continues through the rise of [[Christianity]] and the [[fall of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), ending in the dissolution of classical culture with the close of [[Late Antiquity]].

Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. &quot;Classical antiquity&quot; typically refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, &quot;the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!&quot; In the 18th and 19th centuries AD reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].

In politics, the presence of a [[Roman Emperor]] was felt to be desirable long after the [[fall of the Roman Empire|empire fell]]. This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[coronation|crowned]] &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.

[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature.

In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, (though while apparently more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek). Still, one needs only to look at [[Washington, DC]] to see a city filled with large [[marble]] buildings with façades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders]] of architecture.

In philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[paganism]] to [[Christianity]]. Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] theatre, [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]]. The [[Renaissance]] was partly caused by the rediscovery of classic antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Renaissance discovery of Classical Antiquity'' by [[Roberto Weiss]]&lt;/ref&gt;

*529 The Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] ordered the prominent philosophical schools of antiquity throughout the Eastern Roman Empire (including the famous Academy in Athens, among others) to close down—allegedly, because Justinian frowned upon the pagan nature of these schools

=====Classical ancient history end=====
The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the [[Early Middle Ages]] is known as [[Late Antiquity]]. Some key dates marking that transition are:
*293: reforms of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]]
*395: the division of [[Roman Empire]] into the [[Western Roman Empire]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire]]
[[Image:East-Hem 475ad.jpg|thumb|222px|Eastern Hemisphere in 476 AD.]]
*476: the fall of Western Roman Empire
*529: closure of [[Platon Academy]] in [[Athens]] by Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]]

The beginning of the Middle Ages is a period in the history of Europe following the fall of the Western Roman Empire spanning roughly five centuries from AD 500 to 1000. Aspects of continuity with the earlier classical period are discussed in greater detail under the heading &quot;Late Antiquity&quot;. Late Antiquity is the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the 3rd century (c. 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the Byzantine Empire under Heraclius.

The [[Ancient Near East]] is considered the [[cradle of civilization]]. It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].

====Mesopotamia====

[[Image:Kinadshburn.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] on a chariot during a royal lion hunt.]]
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).

[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with [[Babylon]] as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728–1686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being a [[Semitic]] people, Babylonia adopted the written Semitic [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.

The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th (&quot;Chaldean&quot;) dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] who conquered [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].

[[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] was a city and its surrounding region in central [[Mesopotamia]]. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WebsterNinthNewCollege&quot;&gt;Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. &quot;Akkad.&quot; ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed. Springfield, MA: [[Merriam-Webster]] Inc., 1985. ISBN 0-87779-508-8, ISBN 0-87779-509-6 (indexed), and ISBN 0-87779-510-X (deluxe).&lt;/ref&gt; The city was probably situated on the west bank of the [[Euphrates]], between [[Sippar]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (in present-day [[Iraq]], about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the center of [[Baghdad]]). Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant [[Semitic language|Semitic]] dialect: the [[Akkadian language]], reflecting use of ''akkadû'' (&quot;in the language of Akkad&quot;) in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text.

[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]] river, named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term &quot;Assyria proper&quot; referred to roughly the northern half of [[Mesopotamia]] (the southern half being [[Babylonia]]), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th c. BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th c. BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911–612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented. Assyrians invented [[sapping|excavation to undermine]] [[fortification|city walls]], [[battering ram]]s to knock down gates, as well as the concept of a corps of [[engineers]], who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 9 June 2008 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/385882/Mitanni&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; empire in northern [[Mesopotamia]] from c. 1500 BC. At the height of Mitanni power, during the 14th century BC, it encompassed what is today southeastern [[Turkey]], northern [[Syria]] and northern [[Iraq]], centered around its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose precise location has not been determined by archaeologists.

Its culture played a crucial role in the [[Gutian Empire]], especially during the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] that succeeded it, when the [[Elamite language]] remained among those in official use. The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the [[history of Iran]].

The [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. The established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.

The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the first of the [[Persian Empire]]s to rule over significant portions of [[Greater Persia]], and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the [[Persian Peoples]]. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's official language. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.
[[Image:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC. The [[Parthia]]n Empire (mostly [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian]]) is shown in red, other areas, dominated by [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]), in orange.]]
[[Parthia]] was an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran. Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire – even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The Parthian empire was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over the [[Iran]]ian plateau, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and intermittently controlled [[Mesopotamia]] between 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Empire]].

The [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods. In many ways the Sassanid period witnessed the highest achievement of [[Persian culture|Persian civilization]], and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] and adoption of Islam.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably during the Sassanids' times,&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J.

====Armenia====
The early history of the [[Hittite empire]] is known through tablets that may first have been written in the 17th century BC but survived only as copies made in the 14th and 13th centuries BC. These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[StBoT]] 18&lt;/ref&gt; begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Neša]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).

Assyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] &amp;ndash; a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in [[Armenian Highland]] in the 13th - 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883-859 BC).

The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 190 BC to 387 АD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95 BC - 55 BC under the rule of King Tigranes the Great, the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s. During this short time it was considered to be the most powerful state in the Roman East.&lt;ref&gt;Time Almanac - Page 724 by Editors of Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Review - Page 208 edited by Archibald Grove, William Ernest Henley&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arabia====
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}
The history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars.

The first known inscriptions of the [[Kingdom of Hadhramaut]] are known from the 8th century BC. It was first referenced by an outside civilization in an [[Sabaean language|Old Sabaic]] inscription of Karab'il Watar from the early 7th century BC, in which the King of Hadramaut, Yada`'il, is mentioned as being one of his allies.

[[Dilmun]] appears first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the end of fourth millennium BC, found in the temple of goddess [[Inanna]], in the city of [[Uruk]]. The adjective ''Dilmun'' refers to a type of axe and one specific official; in addition, there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Harriet E. W. (1998). Dilmun and its Gulf neighbours. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 5. ISBN 0-521-58348-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sabaeans]] were an ancient people speaking an [[Old South Arabian]] language who lived in what is today [[Yemen]], in south west [[Arabian Peninsula]]; from 2000 BC to the 8th century BC. Some Sabaeans also lived in [[D'mt]], located in northern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], due to their hegemony over the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; They lasted from the early 2nd millennium to the 1st century BC. In the 1st century BC it was conquered by the [[Himyar]]ites, but after the disintegration of the first [[Himyarite empire]] of the Kings of Saba' and dhu-Raydan the Middle [[Sabaean Kingdom]] reappeared in the early 2nd century. It was finally conquered by the Himyarites in the late 3rd century.

The ancient [[Kingdom of Awsan]] with a capital at [[Hagar Yahirr]] in the [[wadi]] [[Markha]], to the south of the wadi Bayhan, is now marked by a [[tell]] or artificial mound, which is locally named [[Hagar Asfal]]. Once it was one of the most important small kingdoms of South Arabia. The city seems to have been destroyed in the 7th century BC by the king and [[mukarrib]] of [[Sabaeans|Saba]] [[Karib'il Watar]], according to a Sabaean text that reports the victory in terms that attest to its significance for the Sabaeans.

The [[Himyar]] was a state in ancient [[South Arabia]] dating from 110 BC. It conquered neighbouring [[Sheba|Saba]] (Sheba) in c.25 BC, [[Qataban]] in c.200 AD and [[Hadramaut]] c.300 AD. Its political fortunes relative to Saba changed frequently until it finally conquered the Sabaean Kingdom around 280 CE.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bafaqih 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the dominant state in [[Arabia]] until 525 AD. The economy was based on agriculture.

Foreign trade was based on the export of [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]]. For many years it was also the major intermediary linking East Africa and the Mediterranean world. This trade largely consisted of exporting [[ivory trade|ivory]] from Africa to be sold in the [[Roman Empire]]. Ships from Himyar regularly traveled the East African coast, and the state also exerted a considerable amount of political control of the trading cities of East Africa.

The [[Nabataean]] origins remain obscure. On the similarity of sounds, [[Jerome]] suggested a connection with the tribe [[Nebaioth]] mentioned in ''Genesis'', but modern historians are cautious about an early Nabatean history. The [[Babylonian captivity]] that began in 586 BC opened a power vacuum in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and as [[Edom]]ites moved into [[Judea|Judaean]] grazing lands, Nabataean inscriptions began to be left in Edomite territory (earlier than 312 BC, when they were attacked at [[Petra]] without success by [[Antigonus I]]). The first definite appearance was in 312 BC, when Hieronymus of Cardia, a Seleucid officer, mentioned the Nabateans in a battle report. In 50 BC, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] cited Hieronymus in his report, and added the following: &quot;Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.&quot;

[[Petra]] or [[Sela (Edom)|Sela]] was the ancient capital of [[Edom]]; the Nabataeans must have occupied the old [[Edomite]] country, and succeeded to its commerce, after the Edomites took advantage of the [[Babylonian]] captivity to press forward into southern [[Judea|Judaea]]. This migration, the date of which cannot be determined, also made them masters of the shores of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the important harbor of [[Aqaba|Elath]]. Here, according to [[Agatharchides]], they were for a time very troublesome, as wreckers and pirates, to the reopened commerce between Egypt and the East, until they were chastised by the [[Ptolemies|Ptolemaic rulers of Alexandria]].

The [[Lakhmid Kingdom]] was founded by the Lakhum tribe that immigrated out of [[Yemen]] in the 2nd century and ruled by the [[Banu Lakhm]], hence the name given it. It was formed of a group of [[Arab Christian]]s who lived in Southern [[Iraq]], and made [[al-Hirah]] their capital in (266). The founder of the dynasty was [['Amr]] and the son Imru' al-Qais converted to Christianity. Gradually the whole city converted to that faith. Imru' al-Qais dreamt of a unified and independent Arab kingdom and, following that dream, he seized many cities in [[Arabia]].

The [[Ghassanids]] were a group of South Arabian Christian tribes that emigrated in the early 3rd century from [[Yemen]] to the [[Hauran]] in southern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and the [[Holy Land]] where they intermarried with [[Hellenized]] [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlers and Greek-speaking [[Early Christian]] communities. The Ghassanid emigration has been passed down in the rich oral tradition of southern [[Syria]]. It is said that the Ghassanids came from the city of [[Ma'rib]] in [[Yemen]]. There was a dam in this city, however one year there was so much rain that the dam was carried away by the ensuing flood. Thus the people there had to leave. The inhabitants emigrated seeking to live in less arid lands and became scattered far and wide. The proverb &quot;They were scattered like the people of [[Sheba|Saba]]&quot; refers to that exodus in history. The emigrants were from the southern [[Arab]] tribe of [[Azd]] of the [[Kahlan]] branch of Qahtani tribes.

====Levant====
{{Main|History of Ancient Israel and Judah}}
Though the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. Ugarit passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art.

Concerning the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]], the [[Book of Genesis]] traces the beginning of Israel to three patriarchs of the Jewish people, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], the last also known as ''Israel'' from which the name of the land was subsequently derived. [[Jacob]], called a &quot;wandering [[Aramaean]]&quot; (Deuteronomy 26:5), the grandson of Abraham, had travelled back to Harran, the home of his ancestors, to obtain a wife. Whilst returning from Haran to Canaan, he crossed the [[Jabbok]], a tributary on the Arabian side of the [[Jordan River]] (Genesis 32:22-33). After having sent his family and servants away that night, he wrestled with a strange man at a place henceforth called [[Penuel|Peniel]], who in the morning asked him his name. As a result, he was renamed &quot;Israel&quot;, because he had &quot;wrestled with God&quot; and became, in time, the father of twelve sons by [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], (daughters of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]), and their maidservants [[Bilhah]] and [[Zilpah]]. The twelve were considered the &quot;[[Children of Israel]]&quot;. These stories of the origins of the [[Israelites]] locate them first on the east bank of the Jordan. The stories of Israel move to the west bank with the story of the sacking of [[Shechem]] (Genesis 34:1-33), after which the hill area of Canaan is assumed to have been the historical core of the area of Israel.

====Phoenicians====
[[Phoenicia]] was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient [[Canaan]], with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern day [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the [[Mediterranean]] between the period of 1550 BC to 300 BC.

A written reference, [[Herodotus]]'s account (written c. 440 BC) refers to a memory from 800 years earlier, which may be subject to question in the fullness of genetic results. (''History,'' I:1). This is a legendary introduction to Herodotus' brief retelling of some mythical Hellene-Phoenician interactions. Though few modern archaeologists would confuse this myth with history, a grain of truth may yet lie therein.

====Egypt====
{{Main|Ancient Egypt|Outline of ancient Egypt}}
[[Ancient Egypt]] was a long-lived [[civilization]] geographically located in north-eastern [[Africa]]. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the second millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).

Ancient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).

The civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].

====Nubia====
[[Kushite]] state was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The Kushite civilization has also been referred to as [[Nubia]]. The first cultures arose in [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread is known as the [[Kerma]] civilization. It is through [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] records that most of our knowledge of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] (Cush) comes.

It is also referred to as Ethiopia in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. The Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshipped in Egypt, especially [[Amun|Amon]] and [[Isis]].

====Axum====
The [[Axumite Empire]] was an important trading nation in northeastern [[Africa]], growing from the proto-Aksumite period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. Its ancient capital is found in northern Ethiopia, the Kingdom used the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as early as the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp.57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Aksum is mentioned in the 1st century AD ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world, and states that the ruler of Aksum in the 1st century AD was [[Zoscales]], who, besides ruling in Aksum also controlled two harbours on the [[Red Sea]]: [[Adulis]] (near [[Massawa]]) and Avalites ([[Assab]]). He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the alleged resting place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the home of the [[Queen of Sheba]]. Aksum was also the first major empire to convert to [[Christianity]].

====Land of Punt====
The [[Land of Punt]], also called [[Pwenet]], or Pwene&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw &amp; Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, British Museum Press, London. 1995, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, was a trading partner known for producing and exporting gold, aromatic resins, [[African Blackwood|African blackwood]], [[ebony]], [[ivory]], slaves and wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; Information about Punt has been found in ancient [[Egypt]]ian records of trade missions to this region.
The exact [[Land of Punt#Location|location]] of Punt remains a mystery. The mainstream view is that Punt was located to the south-east of Egypt, most likely on the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]]. The earliest recorded Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (25th century BC) although gold from Punt is recorded as having been in Egypt in the time of king Khufu of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906-07|p=161|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt]], the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt]], the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] and the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]]. In the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in &quot;[[Tale of the shipwrecked sailor|Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&quot;.

====Nok culture====
The [[Nok culture]] appeared in Nigeria around 1000 BC and mysteriously vanished around 200 AD. The civilization’s social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta which have been discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=archaeology&gt;''Shaw, Thurstan, Nigeria: Its Archaeology and early history. Retrieved February 22, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; A Nok sculpture resident at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, portrays a sitting dignitary wearing a &quot;Shepherds Crook&quot; on the right arm, and a &quot;hinged flail&quot; on the left. These are symbols of authority associated with ancient Egyptian pharaohs, and the god Osiris, which suggests that an ancient Egyptian style of social structure, and perhaps religion, existed in the area of modern Nigeria during the late Pharonic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsmia.org/viewer/detail.php?id=5368&amp;i=20&amp;v=12&amp;dept=8&amp;op=1449 |title=artsmia.org : viewer |publisher=Artsmia.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Informational excerpt copied from [[Nigeria]] and [[Nok culture]] articles)

====Carthage====
[[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], bringing with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]].&lt;ref&gt;As recounted by Timaeus, FrGrH 566, fr. 60. Archaeological attestation for so early a date is still wanting, though recent discoveries in situ may point nearly as far back in time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Carthage]] was an informal [[hegemony]] of [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]]s throughout North Africa and modern [[Spain]] from 575 BC until 146 BC. It was more or less under the control of the city-state of [[Carthage]] after the fall of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] to [[Babylonian]] forces. At the height of the city's influence, its empire included most of the western Mediterranean. The empire was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. After the third and [[Third Punic War|final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the territory held by Carthage fell into Roman hands.

{{Main|History of South Asia|History of India|Ancient India}}
The earliest evidence of human civilization in South Asia is from the [[Mehrgarh]] region (7000 BC to 3200 BC) of [[Pakistan]]. Located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River valley and between the present-day Pakistani cities of [[Quetta]], [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]] and [[Sibi]], Mehrgarh was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team directed by French archaeologist Jean-François Jarrige, and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh—in the northeast corner of the {{convert|495|acre|km2}} site—was a small farming village dated between 7000 BC–5500 BC.
Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC.[2]

In April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest evidence in human history for the drilling of teeth in vivo (i.e. in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh.Mehrgarh is sometimes cited as the earliest known farming settlement in South Asia, based on archaeological excavations from 1974 (Jarrige et al.). The earliest evidence of settlement dates from 7000 BC. It is also cited for the earliest evidence of pottery in South Asia. Archaeologists divide the occupation at the site into several periods. Mehrgarh is now seen as a precursor to the Indus Valley Civilization.

====Indus Valley Civilization====
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization}}

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300–1700 BC, flourished 2600–1900 BC), abbreviated IVC, was an ancient [[civilization]] that flourished in the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar-Hakra]] [[river]] valleys primarily in what is now [[Pakistan]], although scattered settlements linked to this ancient civilization have been found in eastern [[Afghanistan]], [[Bahrain]], eastern [[Iran]], western [[India]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. Another name for this civilization is the Harappan Civilization, after the first of its cities to be excavated, [[Harappa]] in the Pakistani province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The IVC might have been known to the [[Sumer]]ians as the [[Meluhha]], and other trade contacts may have included Egypt, Africa, however the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a result of archaeological excavations and rail road building. Prominent historians of Ancient India would include [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] and [[Romila Thapar]].

====Mahajanapadas====
{{See also|Mahajanapadas|Magadha|Maurya Empire}}

The births of [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in the 6th century BC mark the beginning of well-recorded history in the region. Around the 5th century BC, the ancient region of [[Pakistan]] was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] in 522 BC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/persian.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+14:11:44 Achaemenian rule of Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the easternmost satraps of the [[Persian Empire]]. The provinces of Sindh and Panjab were said to be the richest ''satraps'' of the Persian Empire and contributed many soldiers to various Persian expeditions. It is known that a ''Indian'' contingent fought in Xerxes' army on his expedition to Greece. Herodotus mentions that the Indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to the Persian army. He also mentions that the Indus people were clad in armaments made of cotton, carried bows and arrows of cane covered with iron. Herodotus states that in 517 BC Darius sent an expedition under Scylax to explore the Indus. Under Persian rule, much irrigation and commerce flourished within the vast territory of the empire. The Persian empire was followed by the invasion of the Greeks under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s army. Since Alexander was determined to reach the eastern-most limits of the Persian Empire he could not resist the temptation to conquer Pakistan, which at this time was parcelled out into small chieftain- ships, who were feudatories of the Persian Empire. Alexander amalgamated the region into the expanding Hellenic empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/alexander.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+14:11:37 Alexander's invasion of Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rigveda]]'', in [[Sanskrit]], goes back to about 1500 BC. The Indian literary tradition has an oral history reaching down into the [[Vedic period]] of the later 2nd millennium BC.

[[Image:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|right|222px|A political map of the [[Mauryan Empire]], including notable cities, such as the capital [[Pataliputra]], and site of the Buddha's enlightenment.]]

''[[History of India|Ancient India]]'' is usually taken to refer to the &quot;golden age&quot; of classical [[Hindu culture]], as reflected in [[Sanskrit]] literature, beginning around 500 BC with the sixteen monarchies and 'republics' known as the [[Mahajanapadas]], stretched across the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]] from modern-day Afghanistan to [[Bangladesh]]. The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.

Amongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]], one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Asoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]). These kingdoms, while not part of Asoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the [[Maurya Empire]]. There was a strong alliance existed between [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (250&amp;ndash;210 BC) and [[Ashoka]] of India,&lt;ref&gt;Mendis (1999), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; who sent [[Arahat]] [[Mahinda]], four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Wijesooriya (2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; They encountered Devanampiya Tissa at [[Mihintale]]. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks was established in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wijesooriya (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.

The [[Satavahanas]] started out as feudatories to the [[Mauryan Empire]], and declared independence soon after the death of [[Ashoka]] (232 BC). Other notable ancient [[South India]]n dynasties include the [[Kadambas]] of Banavasi, western [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]], [[Badami Chalukyas]], [[Western Chalukyas]],  [[Hoysalas]], [[Kakatiya dynasty]], [[Pallavas]], [[Rashtrakuta]]s of Manyaketha and [[Satavahanas]].

====Middle kingdoms====
{{See also|Middle kingdoms of India|Gupta Empire}}

The period between AD 320–550 is known as the Classical Age, when most of [[North India]] was reunited under the [[Gupta Empire]] (ca. AD 320–550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606–47), North India was reunited briefly.

The educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. The South Indian [[Malabar Coast]] and the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age traded with the [[Graeco-Roman]] world. They were in contact with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Jew]]s, and the [[China|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blandstrom&quot;&gt;(Bjorn Landstrom, 1964; Miller, J.

The regions of South Asia, primarily present-day Pakistan and India, were estimated to have had the largest [[Economic history of India|economy]] of the world between the 1st and 15th centuries AD, controlling between one third and one quarter of the world's wealth up to the time of the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]], from whence it rapidly declined during British rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison]] (2001).

====China====

=====Ancient era=====
{{Main|History of China#Ancient era|l1=Ancient Era of China}}
[[Image:OracleShell.JPG|thumb|right|222px|Replica of an Oracle Bone]] [[Image:Territories of Dynasties in China.gif|thumb|right|222px|Territories occupied by different dynasties and modern political states throughout the history of China.]]
Written records of China's past dates from the [[Shang Dynasty]] (商朝) in perhaps the 13th century BC, and takes the form of inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals—the so-called ''[[oracle bones]]'' (甲骨文). Archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the [[Shang Dynasty]], c. 1600–1046 BC is divided into two sets. The first, from the earlier Shang period (c. 1600–1300) comes from sources at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]] (二里崗), [[Zhengzhou]] (鄭州) and Shangcheng. The second set, from the later Shang or Yin (殷) period, consists of a large body of oracle bone writings. [[Anyang]] (安陽) in modern day Henan has been confirmed as the last of the nine capitals of the Shang (c. 1300–1046 BC).

By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (周朝) began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]]. The king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

=====Spring and Autumn=====
{{Main|Spring and Autumn Period}}
In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (春秋時代), named after the influential [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the Quanrong, forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] (諸子百家) of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]] (儒家), [[Taoism]] (道家), [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (法家) and [[Mohism]] (墨家) were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn Period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consists of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.

=====Warring States=====
{{Main|Warring States Period}}
After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States Period]] (戰國時代). Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC - 256 BC)|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] (四川) and [[Liaoning]] (遼寧), were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]] (郡縣). This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn Period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng &amp; Xian]] (province and county, 省縣). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng (嬴政), the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]] (浙江), [[Fujian]] (福建), [[Guangdong]] (廣東) and [[Guangxi]] (廣西) in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi, 秦始皇帝).

====Japan====
{{Main|History of Japan}}
Japan first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':&lt;ref&gt;後漢書, ''會稽海外有東鯷人 分爲二十餘國''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. Formed from more than one hundred tribes, they come and pay tribute frequently.&quot; The ''[[Book of Wei]]'', written in the 3rd century, noted the country was the unification of some 30 small tribes or states and ruled by a [[shaman]] queen named [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]].

During the [[Han Dynasty]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]], Chinese travelers to [[Kyūshū]] recorded its inhabitants and claimed that they were the descendants of the Grand Count (Tàibó) of the [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. The inhabitants also show traits of the pre-sinicized Wu people with tattooing, teeth-pulling and baby-carrying. The ''Book of Wei'' records the physical descriptions which are similar to ones on ''[[Haniwa]]'' statues, such men with braided hair, tattooing and women wearing large, single-piece clothing.

====Korea====
{{Main|History of Korea}} 
According to the [[Samguk Yusa]] and other Korean medieval-era Folklore collection, [[Gojoseon]] was the first [[Korea]]n kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Jewang Ungi]], [[Dongguk Tonggam]], [[Sejong Sillok]], and [[Chronicle of Korean Rulers]], 제왕연대력 帝王年代曆 Jewang yeondaeryeok, [[Choe Chiwon]] (최치원) (857 - ?)&lt;/ref&gt; Gojoseon was founded in 2333 BC by the legendary ruler [[Dangun]], said to be descended from the Lord of Heaven. Then, Korea was governed for [[Jizi]]&lt;ref&gt;[Records of the Grand Historian] vol.38&lt;/ref&gt; and the 40th generation descendant.&lt;ref&gt;『盎葉記』（李徳懋）&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;清州韓氏族譜&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Records of the Grand Historian]], Korea was founded by [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China in 197 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea 史記 朝鮮列伝第五十五 &quot;朝鮮王満者、故燕人也&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 105 BC, [[Han Dynasty|Han Dynasty China]] ruined Korea and ruled for about 400 years.

The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] ([[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]], and [[Silla]]) conquered other successor states of Gojoseon and came to dominate the peninsula and much of Manchuria. The three kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; [[Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]] were the more powerful states for much of the three kingdoms era. At times more powerful than the neighboring Sui Dynasty, Goguryeo was a regional power that defeated massive [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|Chinese invasions]] multiple times.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson |title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,) |publisher=Asianinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm| archivedate= 28 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Silla gradually extended across Korea and eventually became the first state since [[Gojoseon]] to cover most of Korean peninsula in 676. In 698, former Goguryeo general [[Dae Jo-yeong]] founded [[Balhae]] as the successor to Goguryeo.

[[Unified Silla]] itself fell apart in the late 9th century, giving way to the tumultuous [[Later Three Kingdoms of Korea|Later Three Kingdoms period]] (892-936), which ended with the establishment of the [[Goryeo Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsinfo.co.kr/history/king08.html Wang Geon changed the name of dynasty to Goryeo.]&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Balhae in 926 to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]], much of its people were absorbed into [[Goryeo Dynasty]].

====Vietnam====
{{Main|Ancient Vietnam}}
Around 3000 BC, the 15 different [[Lạc Việt]] ethnic tribes lived together in many areas with other inhabitants. Due to increasing needs to control floods, fights against invaders, and culture and trade exchanges, these tribes living near each other tended to gather together and integrate into a larger mixed group. Among these Lac Viet tribes was the Van Lang, which was the most powerful tribe. The leader of this tribe later joined all the tribes together to found the [[Hồng Bàng Dynasty]] in 2897 BC. He became the first in a line of earliest Vietnamese kings, collectively known as the Hùng kings ([[Hùng Vương]]). The Hùng kings called the country, which was then located on the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] delta in present-day [[northern Vietnam]], [[Văn Lang]]. The people of [[Văn Lang]] were referred to as the Lạc Việt. The next generations followed in their father's footsteps and kept this appellation. Based on historical documents, researchers correlatively delineated the location of Văn Lang Nation to the present day regions of North and north of Central Vietnam, as well as the south of present-day Kwangsi (China).

The [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] culture was a prehistoric [[Bronze Age]] culture that was centered at the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] Valley of northern [[Vietnam]]. Its influence flourished to other parts of Southeast Asia, including the Indo-Malayan Archipelago from about 2000 BC to 200 AD. The theory based on the assumption that bronze casting in eastern Asia originated in northern China; however, this idea has been discredited by archaeological discoveries in north-eastern Thailand in the 1970s. In the words of one scholar, &quot;Bronze casting began in Southeast Asia and was later borrowed by the Chinese, not vice versa as the Chinese scholars have always claimed. Evidence of early kingdoms of Vietnam other than the [[Đông Sơn culture]] in Northern Vietnam was found in [[Cổ Loa]], the ancient city situated near present-day [[Hà Nội]].

====Mongols====
{{Main|History of Mongolia}}
North-western Mongolia was Turkic while south-western Mongolia had come under Indo-European (Tocharian and Scythian) influence. In antiquity, the eastern portions of both [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and [[Outer Mongolia|Outer]] Mongolia were inhabited by Mongolic peoples descended from the [[Donghu people]], including the [[Xianbei state|Xianbei]], [[Wuhuan]], [[Rouran]], [[Tuoba]], [[Murong]], [[Shiwei]], [[Kumo Xi]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]].  These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoralist kingdoms that had close contact with the Chinese. The Donghu are first mentioned by [[Sima Qian]] as already existing in Inner Mongolia north of the [[Yan (state)|state of Yan]] in 699-632 BC. The Mongolic-speaking Xianbei (208 BC-234 AD) originally formed a part of the Donghu confederation, but existed even before that time, as evidenced by a mention in the [[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]] &quot;晉語八&quot; section which states that during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]] (reigned 1042-1021 BC) the Xianbei came to participate at a meeting of Zhou subject-lords at Qiyang (岐阳) (now [[Qishan County]]) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of Chu (楚), since they were not vassals by covenant (诸侯). As a nomadic confedation composed of the Xianbei and Wuhuan, the Donghu were prosperous in the 4th century BC, forcing surrounding tribes to pay tribute and constantly harassing the [[Zhao (state)|State of Zhao]] (325 BC, during the early years of the reign of [[King Wuling of Zhao|Wuling]]) and the State of Yan (in 304 BC [[Qin Kai (general)|General Qin Kai]] was given as a hostage to the Donghu).

In 208 BC Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the formerly superior Donghu, who split into the Xianbei and Wuhuan. The Xianbei fled east all the way to Liaodong. In 49 AD the Xianbei ruler Bianhe attacked the Xiongnu and killed 2000 people after having received generous gifts from Emperor Guangwu of Han. In 54 AD the Xianbei rulers Yuchoupen and Mantu presented themselves to the Han emperor and received the titles of wang and gou. Until 93 AD the Xianbei were quietly protecting the Chinese border from Wuhuan and Xiongnu attacks and received ample rewards. From 93 AD the Xianbei began to occupy the lands of the Xiongnu. 100,000 Xiongnu families changed their name to Xianbei. In 97 AD Feijuxian in Liaodong was attacked by the Xianbei, and the governor Qi Sen was dismissed for inaction. Other Xianbei rulers who were active before the rise of the Xianbei emperor Tanshihuai (141-181) were Yanzhiyang, Lianxu and Cizhiqian. The Xianbei gave rise to different Mongolic branches, for example the Rouran (330-555), Khitan (388-1218) and Shiwei (444-present day). The Khitans developed the [[Khitan scripts]] in 920-925 CE. The Rouran king [[Yujiulü Shelun|Shelun]] was the first major leader of the steppes to adopt (in 402 CE) the title of Khagan (可汗) or Qiudoufa Khan (丘豆伐可汗) (which was originally a title used by Xianbei nobles).

The Mongols of Genghis Khan were the Menggu sub-tribe of the Shiwei Xianbei. The first surviving Mongolian text is the Stele of Yisüngge, a report on sports in [[Mongolian script]] on stone, that is most often dated at the verge of 1224 and 1225.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Γarudi 2002: 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other early sources are written in Mongolian, [[Phagspa script|Phagspa]] (decrets), [[Chinese character|Chinese]] (the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret history]]), [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] (dictionaries) and a few other western scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Rybatzki 2003: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huns====
{{Main|Huns}}
The Huns left practically no written records. There is no record of what happened between the time they left Mongolian Plateau and arrived in Europe 150 years later. The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at the [[lake of Barkol]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]&lt;/ref&gt; after which they fled to the western steppe at [[Kangju]] (centered on the city of [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkistan]] in [[Kazakhstan]]). Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th century suggest that a small tribe called [[Yueban]], remnants of northern Xiongnu, was distributed about the steppe of [[Kazakhstan]].

{{Further|Pre-Columbian|New World|History of the Americas}}
In [[pre-Columbian]] times, several large, centralized ancient civilizations developed in the [[Western Hemisphere]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C The Encyclopedia of world history] By Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer. [http://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;pg=PA21 Page 21]. &quot;Ancient and Classical Periods; 3500 BCE - 500 BCE.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[Mesoamerica]] and western [[South America]].

====Andean civilizations====
Central [[Andes]] in [[South America]] has the largest ancient civilization register, spanning for 4,500 years from [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte chico]] to the latest [[Inca empire]].

====Mesoamerica====
{{Further| Mesoamerica}}
Mesoamerican ancient civilizations included the [[Olmec]]s and [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns. Between 1800 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form and many matured into advanced [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations such as the: Olmec, [[Izapa]], [[Teotihuacan]], Maya, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Tarascan state|Tarascan]], &quot;[[Toltec]]&quot; and [[Aztec]], which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans. These civilizations progress included pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology.

The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BC. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]]. Their writing system had been thought to have influenced the Olmecs but, with recent evidence, the Olmec may have been the first civilization in the area to develop a true writing system independently. At the present time, there is some debate as to whether or not Olmec symbols, dated to 650 BC, are actually a form of writing preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20021207/fob1.asp Script Delivery: New World writing takes disputed turn] ''Science News'' December 7th, 2002; Vol.162 #23&lt;/ref&gt; Olmec symbols found in 2002 and 2006 date to 650 BC&lt;ref&gt;Pohl, Mary; Kevin O.

====Etruria====
The [[history of the Etruscans]] can be traced relatively accurately, based on the examination of [[burial]] sites, [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and [[writing]]. [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] culture that is identifiably and certainly [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] developed in Italy in earnest by 800 BC approximately over the range of the preceding [[Iron Age]] [[Villanovan culture]]. The latter gave way in the 7th century to a culture that was influenced by Greek traders and Greek neighbors in [[Magna Graecia]], the [[Hellenic civilization]] of southern Italy.

From the descendants of the [[Villanovan]] people in [[Etruria]] in central [[Italy]], a separate Etruscan culture emerged in the beginning of the 7th century BC, evidenced by around 7,000 inscriptions in an alphabet similar to that of [[Euboean Greek]], in the non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Etruscan language]]. The burial tombs, some of which had been fabulously decorated, promotes the idea of an aristocratic [[city-state]], with centralized power structures maintaining order and constructing public works, such as irrigation networks, roads, and town defenses.

====Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greece}}
[[Ancient Greece]] is the period in [[Greek history]] lasting for close to a millennium, until the rise of [[Christianity]]. It is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of [[Western world|Western Civilization]]. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the [[Roman Empire]], which carried a version of it to many parts of [[Europe]].

The civilization of the ancient Greeks has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, science, art, and architecture of the modern world, fueling the [[Renaissance]] in Europe and again resurgent during various [[Neoclassicism|neo-Classical]] revivals in 18th and 19th century Europe and The [[Americas]].

Ancient Greece was the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking world in ancient times. It includes not only to the [[geographical]] [[peninsula]] of modern [[Greece]], but also to areas of [[wikt:Hellenic|Hellenic]] culture that were settled in ancient times by Greeks: [[Cyprus]] and the Aegean islands, the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast of [[Anatolia]] (then known as [[Ionia]]), [[Sicily]] and southern [[Italy]] (known as [[Magna Graecia]]), and the scattered Greek settlements on the coasts of [[Colchis]], [[Illyria]], [[Thrace]], [[Egypt]], [[Cyrenaica]], southern [[Gaul]], east and northeast of the [[Iberian peninsula]], [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], [[Taurica]] and further to the east in exotic Asian cities such as [[Taxila]], [[Sagala]] and [[Jhelum (City)|Jhelum]] in modern day [[Pakistan]].

During its twelve-century existence, the Roman civilization shifted from a [[monarchy]] to an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]] to a vast [[empire]]. It came to dominate [[Europe]] and the entire area surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through [[invasion|conquest]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. However, a number of factors led to the eventual [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. The western half of the empire, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and Italy, eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century; the Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the &quot;fall of Rome&quot; and subsequent onset of the [[Middle Ages]].

====Rome====
{{Main|Ancient Rome}}

[[Ancient Rome]] was a civilization that grew out of the city-state of Rome, originating as a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula in the 9th century BC. In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire.

Roman civilization is often grouped into &quot;classical antiquity&quot; with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[roman law|law]], [[roman military|war]], [[roman art|art]], [[roman literature|literature]], [[roman architecture|architecture]], and [[roman language|language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[history of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.

Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. A number of Roman founded cities had [[monument]]al structures. Many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]s, [[thermae|bath complexes]] sometime with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and occasionally functional sewers.

====Late Antiquity====
{{Main|Late Antiquity}}

The [[Roman Empire]] underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational change starting with reign of [[Diocletian]], who began the custom of splitting the Empire into [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves ruled by multiple emperors. Beginning with [[Constantine the Great]] the Empire was [[Christianization|Christianized]], and a new capital founded at [[Constantinople]]. [[Germanic migrations|Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating in the eventual [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Empire in the West]] in 476, replaced by the so-called [[Germanic monarchy|barbarian kingdoms]]. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of [[Europe]].

====Germanic tribes====
{{Main|Germanic peoples}}
[[Image:Nordic Bronze Age.png|right|200px|thumb|Map of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, around 1200 BC.]]
{{Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD)}}
Migration of [[Germanic peoples]] to Britain from what is now northern Germany and southern [[Scandinavia]] is attested from the 5th century (e.g. [[Undley bracteate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html |title=Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Bede's ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum'', the intruding population is traditionally divided into Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, but their composition was likely less clear-cut and may also have included [[Frisii|ancient Frisians]] and [[Franks]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' contains text that may be the first recorded indications of the movement of these [[Germanic Tribes]] to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/newstest/770-parker-library-on-the-web Parker Library on the Web], The Parker Library. (cf., &quot;''One of the most important collections of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts – for centuries kept at Corpus Christi College – has been entirely digitised, making it the first research library to have every page of its collection captured.''&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Angles and Saxons and Jutes were noted to be a [[confederation]] in the Greek [[Geographia]] written by [[Ptolemy]] in around AD 150.

The [[Anglo-Saxon]] is the term usually used to describe the peoples living in the south and east of [[Great Britain]] from the early 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/ |title=History - Anglo-Saxons |publisher=BBC |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-01-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100119072418/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/| archivedate= 19 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedictine monk [[Bede]] identified them as the descendants of three [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]: the [[Angles]], the [[Saxons]], and the [[Jutes]], from the [[Jutland]] peninsula and [[Lower Saxony]] ([[German language|German]]: Niedersachsen, [[Germany]]). The Angles may have come from [[Angeln]], and Bede wrote their nation came to Britain, leaving their land empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm |title=English and Welsh are races apart |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-30 |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spoke [[Ingvaeonic|closely related]] [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] dialects. The Anglo-Saxons knew themselves as the &quot;Englisc,&quot; from which the word &quot;English&quot; derives.

The [[Celts]] were a diverse group of [[tribal societies]] in [[Iron Age Europe]]. [[Proto-Celtic]] culture formed in the [[Early Iron Age]] in [[Central Europe]] ([[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] period, named for the site in present-day Austria). By the later Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period), Celts had expanded over wide range of lands: as far west as [[Ireland]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as far east as [[Galatia]] (central [[Anatolia]]), and as far north as [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-209125/Turkey Britannica] (Turkey) People and Culture&lt;/ref&gt; By the early centuries AD, following the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples]], Celtic culture had become
restricted to the [[British Isles]] ([[Insular Celtic]]), with the [[Continental Celtic]] languages extinct by the mid-1st millennium AD.

[[Viking]] refers to a member of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] ([[Scandinavia]]n) peoples, famous as [[explorer]]s, [[warrior]]s, [[merchants]], and [[piracy|pirates]], who raided and colonized wide areas of [[Europe]] beginning in the late 8th.&lt;ref&gt;Roesdahl, Else. The Vikings. Penguin, 1998. ISBN 0-14-025282-7 p. 9-22.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Norsemen]] used their famed [[longship]]s to travel. The [[Viking Age]] forms a major part of [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]], with a minor, yet significant part in [[History of Europe|European history]].

[[Image:Religious Symbols-ani.gif|noframe|64px|right|]]

New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.

The ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |title=::: 자랑스런 성균관 꽃피우는 유교문화 올바른 인성교육 성균관 예절교실 ::: |publisher=Skkok.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toward [[Japan]].

In the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].

===Science and technology===
{{Main|Ancient technology}}
{{Further|History of science|History of mathematics|History of philosophy}}
{{Ancient technology}}
In the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2012}} during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]]. These advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance.

The characteristics of [[Ancient Egyptian technology]] are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years. The Egyptians invented and used many basic machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to ancient times. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of hydrography, metrology and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. Among the fields of science and technology pursued in India were [[Ayurveda]], [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]]. Some ancient [[List of Indian inventions|inventions]] include [[plastic surgery]], [[cataract surgery]], [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and [[Wootz steel]].

The [[history of science and technology in China]] show significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets and [[SN 185|supernovae]] were made in China. Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.

[[Qanat]]s which likely emerged on the [[Iran]]ian plateau and possibly also in the [[Arabian peninsula]] sometime in the early 1st millennium BC spread from there slowly west- and eastward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]]: &quot;Hydraulic Engineering and Water Supply&quot;, in: [[John Peter Oleson]]: ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008 (editor), ISBN 978-0-19-973485-6, p.291f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maritime activity===
{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}

The history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.

[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the [[Red Sea]] to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].

===Warfare===
{{Main|Ancient warfare}}
[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.

The difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.

These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumerians]], formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.

===Artwork and music===
{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}
[[Image:Sassanid Music Plate 7thcentury.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Iranian peoples|Ancient Iranians]] attached great importance to music and poetry. 7th century silver plate. The British Museum.]]
[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[Music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.
