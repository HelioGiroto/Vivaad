The '''history of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]''' can be separated into three distinct eras.  In the first, the islands were inhabited by three successive [[Amerindian]] societies.  The islands were neglected by the first wave of European colonisation, but were settled by [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1632.  Under British control, the islands witnessed an influx of both Britons and African [[slavery|slaves]].  In 1981, the islands were granted independence as the modern state of Antigua and Barbuda.

== Pre-Columbian settlements ==

[[Antigua]] was first settled by [[hunter-gatherer|pre-agricultural]] Amerindians known as &quot;Archaic People&quot;, (although they are commonly, but erroneously known in Antigua as [[Ciboney|Siboney]], a preceramic Cuban people). The earliest settlements on the island date to 2900 BC. They were succeeded by [[ceramic]]-using agriculturalist [[Saladoid]] people who migrated up the island chain from [[Venezuela]].  They were later replaced by [[Arawakan]] speakers around 1200 AD, and around 1500 by Island [[Carib people|Carib]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiguamuseums.org/prehistoric.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arawaks were the first well-documented group of Antiguans. They paddled to the island by canoe (piragua) from Venezuela, ejected by the Caribs—another people indigenous to the area. Arawaks introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda, raising, among other crops, the famous Antiguan &quot;Black&quot; pineapple. They also cultivated various other foods including: 

* corn
* sweet potatoes (White with firmer flesh than the bright orange &quot;sweet potato&quot; used in the United States.)
* chiles
* guava
* tobacco
* cotton
 
Some of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, still play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. 

For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Ducuna (DOO-koo-NAH) is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. In addition, one of the Antiguan staple foods, fungee (FOON-ji), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water. 

The bulk of the Arawaks left Antigua about 1100 A.D. Those who remained were subsequently raided by the Caribs. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Carib's superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies—enslaving some, and cannibalizing others. 

The Catholic Encyclopedia does make it clear that the European invaders had some difficulty identifying and differentiating between the various native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal/national groups in existence at the time may be much more varied and numerous than the two mentioned in this Article. 

According to A Brief History of the Caribbean (Jan Rogozinski, Penguin Putnam, Inc September 2000 ), European and African diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. No researcher has conclusively proven any of these causes as the real reason for the destruction of West Indian natives. In fact, some historians believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of native deaths while in servitude. Others believe that the reportedly abundant, but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to severe malnutrition of the &quot;Indians&quot; who were used to a diet fortified with protein from sea-life. 

The Indigenous West Indians made excellent sea vessels that they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks populated much of South American and the Caribbean Islands. Relatives of the Antiguan Arawaks and Caribs still live in various countries in South America, notably Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. The smaller remaining native populations in the West Indies maintain a pride in their heritage.

== European colonization ==

[[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the islands in 1493 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] naming the larger one ''Santa Maria de la Antigua''. However, early attempts by Europeans to settle the islands failed due to the Caribs' excellent defenses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} England succeeded in colonising the islands in 1632, with [[Sir Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]] as the first governor. Settlers raised tobacco, [[indigo]], [[ginger]], and [[sugarcane]] as cash crops.  [[Christopher Codrington|Sir Christopher Codrington]] established the first large sugar estate in Antigua in 1674, and leased [[Barbuda]] to raise provisions for his plantations. [[Codrington, Barbuda|Barbuda's only town]] is named after him. In the fifty years after Codrington established his initial plantation, the sugar industry became so profitable that many farmers replaced other crops with sugar, making it the economic backbone of the islands. Codrington and others brought [[slavery|slaves]] from Africa's west coast to work the plantations under brutal conditions.

During the 18th century, Antigua was used as the headquarters of the British [[Royal Navy]] Caribbean fleet. English Dockyard, as it came to be called, a sheltered and well-protected deepwater port, was the main base and facilities there were greatly expanded during the later 18th century. Admiral [[Lord Horatio Nelson]] commanded the British fleet for much of this time, and made himself unpopular with local merchants by enforcing the [[Navigation Act]], a British ruling that only British-registered ships could trade with British colonies. As the United States were no longer British colonies, the act posed a problem for merchants, who depended on trade with the fledgling country.

== Political development ==

With all others in the [[British Empire]], Antiguan slaves were [[abolitionism|emancipated]] in 1834, but remained economically dependent upon the plantation owners. Economic opportunities for the new freedmen were limited by a lack of surplus farming land, no access to credit, and an economy built on agriculture rather than manufacturing. Poor labour conditions persisted until 1939 when a member of a royal commission urged the formation of a trade union movement.

The [[Antigua Trades and Labour Union]], formed shortly afterward, became the political vehicle for [[Vere Cornwall Bird]] who became the union's president in 1943. The [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), formed by Bird and other trade unionists, first ran candidates in the 1946 elections and became the majority party in 1951 beginning a long history of electoral victories.

Voted out of office in the 1971 general elections that swept the progressive labour movement into power, Bird and the ALP returned to office in 1976.

==Independent Antigua and Barbuda ==

The islands achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1981, becoming the nation of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. It remains part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and remains a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]].

In 1997, Prime Minister [[Lester Bird]] announced that a group of ecologically sensitive islands just off Antigua's northeastern coast, previously proposed for national park status, were being turned over to Malaysian developers. The Guiana Island Development Project deal, calling for a 1000-room hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a world-class casino, sparked widespread criticism by environmentalists, minority members in parliament, and the press. The issue came to a head when a local resident shot the PM's brother. Today, the proposed development is mired in lawsuits and politics.

The ALP won renewed mandates in the general elections in 1984 and 1989. In the 1989 elections, the ruling ALP won all but two of the 17 seats. During elections in March 1994, power passed from Vere Bird to his son, [[Lester Bird]], but remained within the ALP which won 11 of the 17 parliamentary seats. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] won the 2004 [[Antigua and Barbuda legislative election, 2004|elections]] and [[Baldwin Spencer]] became Prime Minister, removing from power the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean.
