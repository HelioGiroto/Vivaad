The '''Jìn Dynasty''' ({{zh|s=晋朝|t=晉朝|p=Jìn Cháo|w=Chin⁴-ch'ao²}}, {{IPA-cmn|tɕîn tʂʰɑ̌ʊ|IPA}};), was a dynasty in Chinese history, lasting between the years 265 and 420 [[Common Era|CE]]. There are two main divisions in the history of the Dynasty, the first being '''Western Jin''' ([[Chinese language|ch]]: 西晉, 265–316) and the second '''Eastern Jin''' (ch: 東晉 317–420). Western Jin was founded by [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], with its capital at [[Luoyang]], while Eastern Jin was begun by [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Sima Rui]], with its capital at [[Jiankang]]. The two periods are also known as '''Liang Jin''' (ch: 兩晉 lit, two Jin) and '''Sima Jin''' by scholars, to distinguish this dynasty from other dynasties that use the same Chinese character, such as the [[Later Jin Dynasty (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin Dynasty]] (ch: 後晉).

==Foundation==
The [[Sima (surname)|Sima]] clan was initially subordinate to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty, but the clan's influence and power grew greatly after the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|incident at Gaoping tombs]] in 249. In 265, Sima Yan forced emperor [[Cao Huan]] of Wei to abdicate the throne to him, ending Wei and starting Jin (as Emperor Wu). He named his dynasty after the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] that once ruled the Sima clan's home county of Wen in Henei (present day [[Wen County, Henan]]). In 280, the Jin conquered [[Eastern Wu]] and unified China, but internal conflicts, corruption, and political turmoil quickly weakened the dynasty, and the unification lasted only ten years. Upon the advent of the second Jin emperor, Emperor Hui, various imperial princes tried to grab power in the devastating [[War of the Eight Princes]]. The [[Wu Hu uprising]] followed, during which large numbers of refugees fled south while the north was occupied by various nomadic groups. This marked the end of the Western Jin dynasty in 316 when the Jin court evacuated to the region south of the [[Huai River]], and the beginning of the Eastern Jin and the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period. 

Sima Rui founded the Eastern Jin at Jiankang in 317, with its territory stretching across most of today's southern China. The combination of the Eastern Jin and Sixteen Kingdoms period is sometimes called the '''Eastern Jin Sixteen Kingdoms''' (ch: 東晉十六國). During this period, huge numbers of people moved south from the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]], stimulating the development of Southern China. The Emperors of Eastern Jin had limited power, owing to their dependence on the support of both local and refugee noble families which possessed military power. These families included the Wang family, including the chancellor [[Wang Dao]], and the Xie family of [[Xie An]] and [[Xie Xuan]]. Many fangzhen (ch:[http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E6%96%B9%E9%95%87 方鎮] lit. military county) started to have ambitions which resulted in military revolts, like the rebellions of [[Wang Dun]], [[Su Jun]], and the dictatorship of [[Huan Wen]]. Even though there was the stated goal of getting back the &quot;northern lost lands&quot;, paranoia within the royal family and a constant string of disruptions to the throne caused the loss of support of many officials. 

In 383, [[Former Qin]] mobilized its troops and intended to conquer Eastern Jin. Faced by the threat of invasion, many Jin officials cooperated hoping to repel the attack. After the [[Battle of Fei River|battle of Fei river]], Xie An, Xie Xuan, and other generals were able to push back the Qin's assault and seized back  a huge amount of territory from their enemy. However, more internal political battles from different groups of officials followed [[Huan Xuan]]'s usurpation of the throne. As civilian administration suffered, more revolts from [http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%AD%AB%E6%81%A9 Sun En], [http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%8D%A2%E5%BE%AA Lu Xun], and the declaration of a new kingdom called [[Western Shu]] by the militarist Qiao zong in Eastern Jin's [[Sichuan|Shu region]]. Ultimately, [[Liu Yu]]'s rise ended major chaos and later he took the throne for himself, marking the ending of the Jin Dynasty and the start of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]], and the  [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period of Chinese history.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Jin Dynasty (265-420)}}
[[Image:JinJar.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Hunping]]'' jar of the Western Jìn, with [[Buddhist]] figures.]]
The '''Western Jìn Dynasty''' ([[Chinese language|ch]]: 西晉, 265–316) was founded by [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Emperor Wu]], better known as Sima Yan. Although it provided a brief period of unity after conquering [[Eastern Wu]] in 280, the Jìn suffered a devastating civil war, [[War of the Eight Princes]], after which they could not contain the revolt of nomadic tribes known as the [[Wu Hu]]. The capital, [[Luoyang]] was captured in 311, and [[Emperor Huai of Jin China|Emperor Huai]] was captured. His successor, [[Emperor Min of Jin China|Emperor Min]] was also captured in [[Chang'an]] in 316.

The remnants of the Jìn court fled to the east and reestablished the government at [[Jiankang]], near modern-day [[Nanjing]], under a member of the royal family named the Prince of Langye. The prince was proclaimed [[Emperor Yuan of Jin China|Emperor Yuan]] of the '''Eastern Jìn Dynasty''' (ch: 東晉 317–420) when news of the fall of Chang'an reached the south. (The rival [[Wu Hu]] states in the north, which did not recognize the legitimacy of Jin, would sometimes refer to it as &quot;Langye.&quot;)

[[Image:China400ce.png|thumb|Eastern Jin c. 400 CE]]

Military crises, such as the rebellions of generals [[Wang Dun]] and [[Su Jun]], plagued the Eastern Jìn throughout its 104 years of existence.  However, the [[Battle of Fei River]] turned out to be a major Jìn victory, due to the short-lived cooperation of [[Huan Chong]], brother of a great general [[Huan Wen]], and Prime Minister [[Xie An]]. Later, [[Huan Xuan]], son of [[Huan Wen]], usurped the throne and changed the dynasty's name to [[Huan Chu|Chu]]. He, in turn, was toppled by [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]], who after reinstating [[Emperor An of Jin China|Emperor An]], ordered him strangled and installed his brother, [[Emperor Gong of Jin China|Emperor Gong]], in 419. 

Emperor Gong abdicated in 420 in favor of Liu Yu, ushering in the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] the first of the [[Southern Dynasties]]. The Jin Dynasty thus came to an end.  

Meanwhile, North China was ruled by the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], many of which were founded by the [[Wu Hu]]. The last of these, [[Northern Liang]], was conquered by the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] in 439, ushering in the [[Northern Dynasties]] period.

The Jin Dynasty is well known for the quality of its greenish [[celadon]] porcelain wares, which immediately followed the development of [[proto-celadon]]. Jar designs often incorporated animal, as well as Buddhist, figures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanghai Museum]] permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[Yue ware]] are also known from the Jin Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guimet Museum]] permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;
