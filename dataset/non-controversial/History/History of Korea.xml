{{History of Korea}}

The [[Korean Peninsula]] was inhabited from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] about 400,000-700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert&quot;&gt;Carter J. Eckert, el., &quot;Korea, Old and New: A History&quot;, 1990, pp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton&quot;&gt;[http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/Faculty/Bae/pdfs/2000_Norton_Korean%20Paleoanthropology_JHE.pdf Christopher J.

Bale, &quot;Current Perspectives on Settlement, Subsistence, and Cultivation in Prehistoric Korea&quot;], (2002), ''Arctic Anthropology'', 39: 1-2, pp. 95-121.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Neolithic]] period began after 6000 BCE, followed by the [[Bronze Age]] by 800 BCE,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert 2&quot;&gt;Carter J. Eckert, el., &quot;Korea, Old and New: A History&quot;, 1990, pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot;&gt;Mary E. Connor, &quot;The Korea, A global studies handbook&quot;, 2002, pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim and Bae&quot;&gt;[http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/Bae/pdfs/2010_Kim%20and%20Bae_C14.pdf Jong Chan Kim, Christopher J Bae, “Radiocarbon Dates Documenting The Neolithic-Bronze Age Transition in Korea”], (2010), ''Radiocarbon'', 52: 2, pp. 483-492.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iron Age]] around 400 BCE.

According to the mythic origin story recounted in the [[Samguk Yusa]], the [[Gojoseon]] (Old Joseon) was founded in northern Korea and Manchuria in 2333 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hyong-sik Sin, &quot;A Brief history of Korea&quot;, 2005, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;Ki-Baik Lee, “A New History of Korea”, 1984, p. 14, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Seth, &quot;A history of Korea: from antiquity to the present, 2011, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gija Joseon]] was founded in 12th century BC, and its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hwang&quot;&gt;Kyung Moon Hwang, &quot;A History of Korea, An Episodic Narrative&quot;, 2010, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin state]] was formed in southern Korea in the 3rd century BC. In the 2nd century BC, Gija Joseon was replaced by [[Wiman Joseon]] which fell to the [[Han dynasty]] of China near the end of the century. This resulted in the fall of Gojoseon and led to succeeding warring states, the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms]] period that spanned the later Iron Age. Since the 1st century, [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]] grew to control the peninsula and Manchuria as the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] (57 BC – 668 AD) until unification by Silla in 676. In 698, [[Dae Jo-yeong]] established [[Balhae]] in old territories of Goguryeo,&lt;ref&gt;Keith Pratt, &quot;Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea&quot;, 2006, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Peterson, Phillip Marguelies, &quot;A brief history of Korea&quot;, 2010, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the [[North South States Period]] (698–926).

In the late 9th century, Silla was divided into the [[Later Three Kingdoms of Korea|Later Three Kingdoms]] (892–936), which ended with the unification by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]]'s [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Meanwhile Balhae fell after an invasion by the Khitan [[Liao Dynasty]] and the refugees including the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last Crown Prince]] emigrated to Goryeo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goryeosa&quot;&gt;Kim Jongseo, Jeong Inji, et. al. &quot;Goryeosa (The History of Goryeo)&quot;, 1451, Article for July 934, 17th year in the Reign of Taejo&lt;/ref&gt; During the Goryeo period, laws were codified, a civil service system was introduced, and culture influenced by [[Buddhism]] flourished.

In 1392, [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910) after a coup in 1388. King [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]] (1418–1450) implemented numerous administrative, social, and economical reforms, established royal authority in the early years of the dynasty, and promulgated [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet.

From the late 16th century, the Joseon dynasty faced foreign invasions, internal power struggle and rebellions, and it declined rapidly in the late 19th century. In 1897, the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910) succeeded the Joseon Dynasty. However, [[Imperial Japan]] forced it to sign a [[Eulsa Treaty|protectorate treaty]] and in 1910 [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed the Korean Empire]], though all treaties involved were later confirmed to be null and void.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200108/30/200108300144080739900090809081.html Forced Annexation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korean independence movement|Korean resistance]] was manifested in the widespread nonviolent [[March 1st Movement]] of 1919. Thereafter the [[Korean independence movement|resistance movements]], coordinated by the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] in exile, were largely active in neighboring Manchuria, China and [[Siberia]].

After the liberation in 1945, the partition of Korea created the modern two states of North and South Korea. In 1948, new governments were established, the Democratic [[South Korea]] (&quot;Republic of Korea&quot;) and Communist [[North Korea]] (&quot;Democratic People's Republic of Korea&quot;) divided at the 38th parallel. The unresolved tensions of the division surfaced in the [[Korean War]] of 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea.

==Prehistory and Gojoseon==
{{Main|Prehistoric Korea}}

[[Image:KoreanEarthenwareJar4000BCEAmsa-DongNearSeoul.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Korean earthenware jar with comb pattern. 4000 BC, [[Amsa-dong]], [[Seoul]]. [[British Museum]].]]

No definite [[Homo erectus]] has been found in the [[Korean Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo/homo_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; though a possible [[Homo erectus]] has been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton&quot; /&gt; Tool-making artifacts from the [[Palaeolithic]] period have been found in present-day [[North Hamgyong]], [[South P'yongan]], [[Gyeonggi]], and north and south [[Chungcheong-do|Chungcheong]] Provinces of Korea.,&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 8–12)&lt;/ref&gt; which dates the Paleolithic Age to half a million years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot; /&gt; though it may have begun as late as 400,000 years ago&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert&quot; /&gt; or as early as 600,000-700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sin&quot; /&gt; The predominant view is that the Korean people of today are not the ethnic descendants of these Paleolithic inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot; /&gt;

===Jeulmun Pottery Period===
{{Main|Jeulmun pottery period}}

The earliest known [[Korean pottery]] dates back to around 8000 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Choe and Bale&quot; /&gt; and evidence of [[Mesolithic]] [[Pit-Comb Ware culture]] or Yungimun Pottery is found throughout the peninsula. An example of a Yungimun-era site is in [[Jeju-do]]. Jeulmun or Comb-pattern Pottery is found after 7000 BC, and pottery with comb-patterns over the whole vessel is found concentrated at sites in west-central Korea, where a number of settlements such as [[Amsa-dong]] existed. Jeulmun pottery bears basic design and form similarities to that of the Russian Maritime Province, [[Mongolia]], and the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Sungari River|Sungari]] river basins of [[Manchuria]] and the [[Jōmon]] culture in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam T. Stark (2005, p137)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 23–26)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mumun Pottery Period===
{{Main|Mumun pottery period}}

Archaeological evidence demonstrates that agricultural societies and the earliest forms of social-political complexity emerged in the [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 1500–300 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;mumun&quot;&gt;Sarah M. Nelson (1993, pp. 110–116)&lt;/ref&gt;

People in southern Korea adopted intensive dry-field and [[Paddy field|paddy-field]] agriculture with a multitude of crops in the Early Mumun Period (1500–850 BC). The first societies led by big-men or chiefs emerged in the Middle Mumun (850–550 BC), and the first ostentatious elite burials can be traced to the Late Mumun (c. 550–300 BC). Bronze production began in the Middle Mumun and became increasingly important in ceremonial and political society after 700 BC. Archeological evidence from [[Songguk-ri]], [[Daepyeong]], [[Igeum-dong]], and elsewhere indicate that the Mumun era was the first in which chiefdoms rose, expanded, and collapsed. The increasing presence of long-distance trade, an increase in local conflicts, and the introduction of bronze and iron metallurgy are trends denoting the end of the Mumun around 300 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;mumun&quot;/&gt;

===Gojoseon===
{{Main|Gojoseon}}

[[Image:History of Korea-108 BC.png|left|thumb|180px|Korea in 108 BC.]]
[[File:Korea-Neolithic.age-Sword-01.jpg|thumb|200px|Korean Bronze Age sword. Seoul, [[National Museum of Korea]].]]

[[Gojoseon]] was the first [[Korea]]n kingdom. The founding legend of Gojoseon, which is recorded in the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' (1281) and other medieval Korean books,&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Jewang Ungi]]'' (1287) and ''[[Dongguk Tonggam]]'' (1485).&lt;/ref&gt; states that the country was established in 2333 BC by [[Dangun]], said to be descended from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Kyung Moon hwang (2010), ''A History of Korea: An Episodic Narrative'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While no evidence has been found that supports whatever facts may lie beneath this, the account has played an important role in developing Korean national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Connor, &quot;The Korea, A global studies handbook&quot;, 2002, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The first kingdom of Gojoseon with verifiable historical evidence is [[Gija Joseon]], which was founded in the 12th century BC by a descendant of the Chinese [[Shang Dynasty]]'s royal family named Gija, and lasted until 194 BC. The relevant records can be found in ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' in 91 BC, ''[[Book of Han]]'' in AD 111, ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' in the 5th century and ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in the 3rd century. The existence (there is little archeological evidence pertaining to the issue) and the role of Gija in Korean history (whether Gija replaced the central government of an existing state, founded the first Korean state, or was ensconced in a peripheral region) became controversial in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hwang&quot; /&gt; 

The historical Gojoseon kingdom was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=14543 |title=고조선 |publisher= Naver/Doosan Encyclopedia |language=Korean |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Peterson, Phillip Marguelies, &quot;A brief history of Korea&quot;, 2010, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and by about the 4th century BC it had developed to the point where its existence was well known in China.&lt;ref&gt;Carter J. Eckert, el., &quot;Korea, Old and New: History&quot;, 1990, pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ki-Baik Lee, “A New History of Korea”, 1984, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 4th Century BC, its capital moved to [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g4157b001 Gojoseon territory] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/04/eak/ht04eak.htm Timeline of Art and History, Korea, 1000 BC-1 AD], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

In 194 BC, [[King Jun of Gojoseon|King Jun]] fled to [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin state]] after a coup by [[Wiman of Gojoseon|Wiman]], who founded [[Wiman Joseon]]. Later the [[Han Dynasty]] defeated the [[Wiman Joseon]] and set up [[Four Commanderies of Han]] in 108 BC. There was a significant Chinese presence in northern parts of the Korean peninsula during the next century, and the [[Lelang Commandery]] persisted for about 400 years until it was conquered by [[Goguryeo]]. Around 300 BC, a state called [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin]] arose in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Very little is known about Jin, but it established relations with Han China and exported artifacts to the [[Yayoi]] of [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/history/worldhistory/yayoi-period-ema-06/ Yayoi Period History Summary], BookRags.com; [http://www2.gol.com/users/hsmr/Content/East%20Asia/Japan/History/roots.html Japanese Roots], Jared Diamond, ''Discover'' 19:6 (June 1998); [http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/japanorigin.htm The Genetic Origins of the Japanese], Thayer Watkins&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100 BC, Jin evolved into the [[Samhan]] confederacies.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 92–95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many smaller states sprang from the former territory of Gojoseon such as [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]], [[Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]]. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] refer to [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]], although Buyeo and the [[Gaya confederacy]] existed into the 5th and 6th centuries respectively.

===Metallurgy===
The [[Bronze Age]] is often held to have begun around 900-800 BC in Korea,&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot; /&gt; though the transition to the Bronze Age may have begun as far back as 2300 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim and Bae&quot; /&gt; Bronze daggers, mirrors, and weaponry have been found, as well as evidence of walled-town polities. Rice, red beans, soybeans and millet were cultivated, and rectangular pit-houses and increasingly larger [[dolmen]] burial sites are found throughout the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977 Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous records suggest that Gojoseon transitioned from a feudal federation of walled cities into a centralised kingdom at least before the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 82–85)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that by the 4th century BC, iron culture was developing in Korea as the warring states of China pushed refugees east and south.

==Proto–Three Kingdoms==
{{Main|Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea}}

[[Image:History of Korea-001.png|thumb|200px|Proto–Three Kingdoms, c. 1 CE.]]
[[Image:Ddol-mangB.jpg|200px|thumb|Gold buckle of the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms]] period]]

The Proto–Three Kingdoms period, sometimes called the Several States Period (열국시대),&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=120316  Proto-Three Kingdoms period] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the time before the rise of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], which included [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]], and [[Baekje]], and occurred after the fall of [[Gojoseon]]. This time period consisted of numerous states that sprang up from the former territories of Gojoseon. Among these states, the largest and most influential were [[Dongbuyeo]] and [[Bukbuyeo]].

===Buyeo and other Northern states===
{{Main|Buyeo kingdom|Okjeo|Dongye}}

After the fall of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] arose in today's [[North Korea]] and southern [[Manchuria]], from about the 2nd century BC to 494. Its remnants were absorbed by [[Goguryeo]] in 494, and both Goguryeo and [[Baekje]], two of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], considered themselves its successor.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 109–116)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although records are sparse and contradictory, it is thought that in 86 BC, [[Dongbuyeo]] (East Buyeo) branched out, after which the original Buyeo is sometimes referred to as [[Bukbuyeo]] (North Buyeo). [[Jolbon|Jolbon Buyeo]] was the predecessor to [[Goguryeo]], and in 538, Baekje renamed itself ''Nambuyeo'' (South Buyeo).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254242&amp;v=43 Buyeo] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okjeo]] was a tribal state that was located in the northern [[Korean Peninsula]], and was established after the fall of Gojoseon. Okjeo had been a part of [[Gojoseon]] before its fall. It never became a fully developed kingdom due to the intervention of its neighboring kingdoms. Okjeo became a tributary of Goguryeo, and was eventually annexed into Goguryeo by [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto Taewang]] in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 128–130)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dongye]] was another small kingdom that was situated in the northern [[Korean Peninsula]]. Dongye bordered [[Okjeo]], and the two kingdoms faced the same fate of becoming tributaries of the growing empire of [[Goguryeo]]. Dongye was also a former part of [[Gojoseon]] before its fall.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 130–131)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samhan===
{{Main|Samhan|Mahan confederacy|Jinhan confederacy|Byeonhan confederacy}}

Sam han (삼한, 三韓) refers to the three confederacies of [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]], and [[Byeonhan]]. The Samhan were located in the southern region of the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=86824 Samhan] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Samhan countries were strictly governed by law, with religion playing an important role. Mahan was the largest, consisting of 54 states, and assumed political, economic, and cultural dominance. Byeonhan and Jinhan both consisted of 12 states, bringing a total of 78 states within the Samhan. The Samhan were eventually conquered by [[Baekje]], [[Silla]], and [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 135–141)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Kingdoms Era==
{{Main|Three Kingdoms of Korea}}

===Goguryeo===
{{Main|Goguryeo}}

[[Image:History of Korea-476.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Goguryeo at its height, in 476 CE.]]
[[Image:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|200px|An example of a [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo tomb mural]].]]
Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC by [[Dongmyeongseong of Goguryeo|Jumong]] (posthumous name Dongmyeongseong).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=12449 Goguryeo] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Taejo of Goguryeo|King Taejo]] centralized the government. Goguryeo was the first Korean kingdom to adopt Buddhism as the state religion in 372, in [[Sosurim of Goguryeo|King Sosurim]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=722626 Buddhism in Goguryeo] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh goguryeo&quot;&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 199–202)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goguryeo reached its zenith in the 5th century, when [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]], expanded the country into almost all of Manchuria and part of inner Mongolia, and took the present-day [[Seoul]] from Baekje. Gwanggaeto and Jangsu subdued Baekje and Silla during their times.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh goguryeo&quot;/&gt;

Goguryeo later fought and defeated massive [[China|Chinese]] invasions in the [[Goguryeo-Sui War]] of 598 – 614, which contributed to [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]]'s fall, and continued to repel the [[Tang dynasty]] under several generals including [[Yeon Gaesomun]] and [[Yang Manchun]] (see [[Goguryeo–Tang War]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 214–222)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history/three_kingdoms.htm Three Kingdoms] Asian Info Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerous wars with China exhausted Goguryeo and it fell into a weak state. After internal power struggles, it was conquered by allied Silla-Tang forces in 668.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp 224–225)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Korea-Baekje-Incense.burner-01.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje]]]]

===Baekje===
{{Main|Baekje}}

[[Baekje]]'s foundation by [[Onjo of Baekje|King Onjo]] in 18 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;mcc 3kingdoms&quot;&gt;Marshall Cavendish Corporation (2007, pp. 886–889)&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[Samguk Sagi]], followed those of [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]].

The [[Sanguo Zhi]] mentions Baekje as a member of the [[Mahan confederacy]] in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] basin (near present-day [[Seoul]]). It expanded into the southwest ([[Chungcheong]] and [[Jeolla]] provinces) of the peninsula and became a significant political and military power. In the process, Baekje came into fierce confrontation with Goguryeo and the Chinese commanderies in the vicinity of its territorial ambitions.

At its peak in the 4th century in the reign of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|King Geunchogo]], it had absorbed all of the Mahan states and subjugated most of the western Korean peninsula (including the modern provinces of [[Gyeonggi]], [[Chungcheong]], and [[Jeolla]], as well as part of [[Hwanghae]] and [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon]]) to a centralized government. Baekje acquired Chinese culture and technology through contacts with the [[Southern Dynasties]] during the expansion of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 202–206)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baekje played a fundamental role in transmitting cultural developments, such as [[Chinese characters]], [[Buddhism]], iron-making, advanced [[pottery]], and ceremonial burial into ancient [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=580 Korean Buddhism Basis of Japanese Buddhism], Seoul Times, 2006-06-18; [http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/buddhist_trade/koreajapan.html Buddhist Art of Korea &amp; Japan], Asia Society Museum; [http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2046.html Kanji], JapanGuide.com; [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568150_4/Pottery.html Pottery], MSN Encarta; [http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=359&amp;pID=334&amp;cName=Japanese History of Japan], JapanVisitor.com;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257012851343397 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of culture were also transmitted when the Baekje court retreated to Japan after Baekje was conquered. Baekje was defeated by a coalition of Silla and [[Tang Dynasty]] forces in 660.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baekje.chungnam.net/english/index.jsp Baekje history], Baekje History &amp; Culture Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silla===
{{Main|Silla}}
[[Image:Hwangnyongsa Pagoda miniature.jpg|200px|thumb|Down-sized replica of the famous 80 meter tall pagoda at [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple which was destroyed by the Mongols.]]
According to legend, the kingdom [[Silla]] began with the unification of six chiefdoms of the [[Jinhan confederacy]] by [[Bak Hyeokgeose]] in 57 BC, in the southeastern area of Korea. Its territory included the present-day port city of [[Busan]], and Silla later emerged as a sea power responsible for destroying Japanese pirates, especially during the [[Unified Silla]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Lee (1997, pp. 48–49)&lt;/ref&gt;

Silla artifacts, including unique gold metalwork, show influence from the northern nomadic steppes, with less Chinese influence than are shown by Goguryeo and Baekje.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, (1993, pp. 243–258)&lt;/ref&gt; Silla expanded rapidly by occupying the [[Nakdong River]] basin and uniting the city-states.

By the 2nd century, Silla was a large state, occupying and influencing nearby city states. Silla gained further power when it annexed the [[Gaya confederacy]] in 562. Silla often faced pressure from Gougryeo, Baekje and Japan, and at various times allied and warred with Baekje and [[Goguryeo]].

In 660, King [[Muyeol of Silla]] ordered his armies to attack [[Baekje]]. General [[Kim Yu-shin]], aided by [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] forces, conquered Baekje. In 661, Silla and Tang moved on [[Goguryeo]] but were repelled. King [[Munmu of Silla|Munmu]], son of Muyeol and nephew of Kim, launched another campaign in 667 and Goguryeo fell in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 222–225)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaya===
{{Main|Gaya confederacy}}

[[Gaya Confederacy|Gaya]] was a confederacy of small kingdoms in the [[Nakdong River]] valley of southern [[Korea]], growing out of the [[Byeonhan confederacy]] of the [[Samhan]] period. Gaya's plains were rich in iron, so export of iron tools was possible and agriculture flourished. In the early centuries, the Confederacy was led by [[Geumgwan Gaya]] in the [[Gimhae]] region. However, its leading power changed to [[Daegaya]] in the [[Goryeong]] region after the 5th century.

Constantly engaged in war with the three kingdoms surrounding it, Gaya was not developed to form a unified state, and was ultimately absorbed into [[Silla]] in 562.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 159–162)&lt;/ref&gt;

==North and South States==
{{Main|North South States Period}}

The term North-South States refers to [[Unified Silla]] and [[Balhae]], during the time when Silla controlled the majority of the Korean peninsula while Balhae expanded into [[Manchuria]]. During this time, culture and technology significantly advanced, especially in Unified Silla.

===Unified Silla (Later Silla)===
{{Main|Unified Silla}}
{{Main|Silla-Tang War}}

[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-33.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bulguksa]]|[[Bulguksa]] Temple is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
After the unification wars, the [[Tang Dynasty]] established outposts in the former [[Goguryeo]], and began to establish and administer communities in [[Baekje]]. Silla attacked Tang forces in Baekje and northern Korea in 671. Tang then invaded Silla in 674 but Silla drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula by 676 to achieve unification of most of the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 241–242)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unified Silla was a time when Korean arts flourished dramatically and Buddhism became a large part of culture. Buddhist monasteries such as the [[World Heritage Site]]s [[Bulguksa]] temple and [[Seokguram]] Grotto are examples of advanced Korean architecture and Buddhist influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736 Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Other state-sponsored art and architecture from this period include [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple and [[Bunhwangsa]] Temple.

Silla began to experience political troubles in late 8th century. This severely weakened Silla and soon thereafter, descendants of the former Baekje established [[Hubaekje]]. In the north, rebels revived Goguryeo, beginning the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period.

Unified Silla lasted for 267 years until [[Gyeongsun of Silla|King Gyeongsun]] surrendered the country to [[Goryeo]] in 935, after 992 years and 56 monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 266–269)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balhae===
{{Main|Balhae}}

[[Image:Pressapochista4.jpg|thumb|170px|Balhae stele at the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
[[Balhae]] was founded only thirty years after Goguryeo had fallen. It was founded in the northern part of former lands of Goguryeo by [[Dae Joyeong]], a former Goguryeo general.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=14170 Dae Joyeong] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Balhae controlled the northern areas of the [[Korean Peninsula]], much of Manchuria (though it didn't occupy [[Liaodong peninsula]] for much of history), and expanded into present-day [[Primorsky Krai|Russian Primorsky Krai]]. Balhae styled itself as Goguryeo's [[successor state]]. It also adapted the culture of [[Tang Dynasty]], such as the government structure and geopolitical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 244–248)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a time of relative peace and stability in the region, Balhae flourished, especially during the reigns of the third [[Mun of Balhae|Emperor Mun]] (r. 737–793) and [[Seon of Balhae|Emperor Seon]]. However, Balhae was severely weakened by the 10th century, and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]] conquered Balhae in 926.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;/&gt; Tens of thousands of refugees, including [[Dae Gwang-hyeon]], the last Crown Prince, emigrated to Goryeo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goryeosa&quot; /&gt;

No historical records from Balhae have survived, and the Liao left no histories of Balhae. While [[Goryeo]] absorbed some Balhae territory and received Balhae refugees, it compiled no known histories of Balhae either. The [[Samguk Sagi]] (&quot;History of the Three Kingdoms&quot;), for instance, includes passages on Balhae, but does not include a dynastic history of Balhae. The 18th century [[Joseon dynasty]] historian [[Yu Deukgong]] advocated the proper study of Balhae as part of Korean history, and coined the term &quot;North and South States Period&quot; to refer to this era.&lt;ref name=&quot;lhh balhae&quot;/&gt;

===Later Three Kingdoms===
{{Main|Later Three Kingdoms}}
The Later Three Kingdoms (892 – 936 CE) consisted of [[Silla]], [[Hubaekje]] (&quot;Later [[Baekje]]&quot;), and [[Taebong]] (also known as Hugoguryeo, &quot;Later [[Goguryeo]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=260575&amp;v=43 Later Three Kingdoms] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two, established as [[Unified Silla]] declined in power, claimed to be heirs to Baekje and Goguryeo.

[[Taebong]] (Later Goguryeo) was originally led by [[Gung Ye]], a Buddhist monk who founded Later Goguryeo. The unpopular Gung Ye was deposed by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]] in 918. Wang Geon was popular with his people, and he decided to unite the entire peninsula under one government. He attacked Later Baekje in 934 and received the surrender of Silla in the following year. In 936, Goryeo conquered [[Hubaekje]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreanhistory.info/Koryo.htm Goryeo Dynasty], Korean History information!&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goryeo==
{{Main|Goryeo}}

[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Celadon [[Incense Burner]] from the Korean [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (918–1392), with kingfisher color [[glaze]].]]
[[Goryeo]] was founded in 918 AD and became the ruling dynasty of Korea by 936. &quot;Goryeo&quot; was named as [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]] deemed the nation as a successor of [[Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, p266)&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty lasted until 1392, and it is the source of the English name &quot;Korea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 120–121)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=151665 Korea] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period laws were codified, and a civil service system was introduced. [[Buddhism]] flourished, and spread throughout the peninsula. The development of [[celadon]] pottery flourished in the 12th and 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 360–361); The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 122–123)&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of [[Tripitaka Koreana]] onto 81,258 wooden blocks&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 309–312)&lt;/ref&gt; and the invention of movable-metal-type [[printing press]] attest to Goryeo's cultural achievements.

In 1231 the [[Mongols]] began their [[Mongol invasions of Korea|campaigns against Korea]] and after 25 years of struggle, Goryeo relented by signing a treaty with the Mongols. For the following 80 years Goryeo survived as a tributary ally of the Mongol-ruled [[Yuan Dynasty]] in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 343–350); The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 142–145)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1350s, the Yuan Dynasty declined rapidly due to internal struggles, enabling King [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]] to reform the Goryeo government.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 351–353)&lt;/ref&gt; Gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with, including the removal of pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officials, the question of land holding, and quelling the growing animosity between the Buddhists and Confucian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 152–155)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goryeo dynasty would last until 1392. [[Taejo of Joseon]], the founder of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], took power in a coup in 1388 and after serving as a power behind the throne for two monarchs, established the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1392.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 369–370)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseon==
{{Main|Joseon Dynasty}}
[[Image:Gyeongbok-gung palace-05 (xndr).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Gyeongbokgung]] Palace]]

===Political history===
In 1392, the general [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], later known as Taejo, established the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897), named in honor of the ancient kingdom [[Gojoseon]]&lt;ref&gt;Literally &quot;old Joseon&quot;, the term was first coined in the 13th century AD to differentiate the ancient kingdom from [[Wiman Joseon]] and is now used to differentiate it from the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. See: {{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=14543 Gojoseon] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and based on idealistic [[Confucianism]]-based ideology.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, Vol.1 pp. 160–163)&lt;/ref&gt;

Taejo moved the capital to [[Hanyang]] (modern-day [[Seoul]]) and built [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace. In 1394 he adopted [[Neo-Confucianism]] as the country's official religion, and pursued the creation of a strong bureaucratic state. His son and grandson, [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]] and [[Sejong of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]], implemented numerous administrative, social, and economical reforms and established royal authority in the early years of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 371–375)&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal conflicts within the royal court, civil unrest and other political struggles plagued the nation in the years that followed, worsened by the [[Imjin War|Japanese invasion of Korea]] between 1592 and 1598. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] marshalled his forces and tried to invade [[Asia|the Asian continent]] through Korea, but was eventually repelled by [[righteous army|righteous armies]], Korean Army and Navy, and assistance from [[Ming China]]. This war also saw the rise of the career of Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] with the &quot;[[turtle ship]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, Vol. 1 pp. 190–195)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joseon was striving to rebuild itself after the war, it suffered from the [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|invasions by the Manchu in 1627]] [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|and 1636]]. Different views regarding foreign policy divided the royal court, and ascensions to the throne during that period were decided after much political conflict and struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 413–416)&lt;/ref&gt;

A period of peace followed in the 18th century during the years of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]], who led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty, with fundamental reforms to ease the political tension between the Confucian scholars, who held high positions.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, Vol. 1 pp. 218–221)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 421–424)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, corruption in government and social unrest prevailed in the years thereafter, causing numerous civil uprisings and revolts. The government made sweeping reforms in the late 19th century, but adhered to a strict isolationist policy, earning Joseon the nickname &quot;[[Hermit Kingdom]]&quot;. The policy had been established primarily for protection against Western [[imperialism]], but before long Joseon was forced to open trade, beginning an era leading into [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp 469–470)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and society===

[[Image:Koreans oldest pic 3.jpg|150px|thumb|One of the earliest photographs depicting [[yangban]] Koreans, taken in 1863.]]
Joseon's culture was based on the philosophy of [[Neo-Confucianism]], which emphasizes morality, righteousness, and practical ethics. Wide interest in scholarly study resulted in the establishment of private academies and educational institutions. Many documents were written about history, geography, medicine, and Confucian principles. The arts flourished in painting, calligraphy, music, dance, and [[Korean pottery and porcelain|ceramics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 391–401)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable cultural event of this era is the promulgation of the Korean alphabet ''[[Hangul]]'' by [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]] in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korean.go.kr/eng_hangeul/setting/001.html Hangul], The National Institute of the Korean Language&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw various other cultural, scientific and technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 168–173)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Joseon, a social hierarchy system existed that greatly affected Korea's social development. The king and the royal family were atop the hereditary system, with the next tier being a class of civil or military officials and land owners known as ''[[yangban]]'', who worked for the government and lived off the efforts of tenant farmers and slaves.

A middle class, ''jungin'', were technical specialists such as scribes, medical officers, technicians in science-related fields, artists and musicians. Commoners, i.e. peasants, constituted the largest class in Joseon. They had obligations to pay taxes, provide labor, and serve in the military. By paying land taxes to the state, they were allowed to cultivate land and farm. The lowest class included tenant farmers, slaves, entertainers, craftsmen, prostitutes, laborers, shamans, vagabonds, outcasts, and criminals. Although slave status was hereditary, they could be sold or freed at officially set prices, and the mistreatment of slaves was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 387–389)&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''yangban'' focused system started to change in the late 17th century as political, economic and social changes came into place. By the 19th century, new commercial groups emerged, and the active social mobility caused the ''yangban'' class to expand, resulting in the weakening of the old class system. The Joseon government ordered the freedom of government slaves in 1801. The class system of Joseon was completely banned in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, pp. 435–437)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign invasions===

[[Image:KoreanEmbassy1655KanoTounYasunobu.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Joseon Tongsinsa|Korean Embassy to Japan]], 1655, attributed to Kano Toun Yasunobu. [[British Museum]].]]

Joseon dealt with a pair of [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions from 1592 to 1598]] (''[[Imjin War]]'' or the ''Seven Years war''). Prior to the war, Korea sent two ambassadors to scout for signs of Japan's intentions of invading Korea. However, they came back with 2 different reports, and while the politicians split into sides, little proactive measures were taken.

This conflict brought prominence to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] as he contributed to eventually repelling the Japanese forces with the innovative use of his invention, the [[turtle ship]], a massive, yet swift, ramming/cannon ship fitted with iron spikes and, according to some sources, an iron-plated deck&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley 2005, 195f.&quot;&gt;Hawley, Samuel: ''The Imjin War.

The use of the [[hwacha]] was also highly effective in repelling the Japanese invaders from the land.

Subsequently, Korea was [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|invaded by the Manchus in 1627]] [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|and again in 1636]], after which the Joseon dynasty recognized the suzerainty of the [[Qing]] Empire.

During the 19th century, Joseon tried to control foreign influence by closing the borders to all nations but China. In 1853 the [[USS South America]], an American gunboat, visited [[Busan]] for 10 days and had amiable contact with local officials. Several Americans shipwrecked on Korea in 1855 and 1865 were also treated well and sent to China for repatriation. The Joseon court was aware of the foreign invasions and treaties involving Qing China, as well as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, and followed a cautious policy of slow exchange with the West.

In 1866, reacting to greater numbers of Korean converts to Catholicism despite several waves of persecutions, the Joseon court clamped down on them, massacring French Catholic missionaries and Korean converts alike. Later in the year France invaded and occupied portions of Ganghwa Island. The Korean army lost heavily, but the French abandoned the island.

The ''General Sherman'', a American-owned armed merchant marine sidewheel schooner, attempted to open Korea to trade in 1866. After an initial miscommunication, the ship sailed upriver and became stranded near Pyongyang.  After being ordered to leave by the Korean officials, the American crewmen killed four Korean inhabitants, kidnapped a military officer and engaged in sporadic fighting that continued for four days. After two efforts to destroy the ship failed, she was finally set aflame by Korean [[fireships]] laden with explosives.
{{Wikisource|Littell's Living Age/Volume 129/Issue 1662/A Glimpse of the Korea|a description of a visit to Korea by a British ship in 1876}}

In response, the United States confronted Korea militarily in 1871, killing 243 Koreans in Ganghwa island before withdrawing. This incident is called the [[Sinmiyangyo]] in Korea. Five years later, the reclusive Korea signed a trade treaty with Japan, and in 1882 signed a treaty with the United States, ending centuries of isolationism.

In 1885, [[United Kingdom]] occupied [[Geomun Island Incident|Geomun Island]], and withdrew in 1887.

After a [[Meiji period|rapidly modernizing Japan]] forced Korea to open its ports in 1876, it successfully challenged the Qing Empire in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895). In 1895, the Japanese were involved in the murder of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]],&lt;ref name=&quot;myeongseong&quot;&gt;Andre Schmid (2002, p72); The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, p43)&lt;/ref&gt; who had sought Russian help, and the Russians were forced to retreat from Korea for the time.

[[File:Switchboard during the Korean Empire.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Telephone switchboard|Switchboard]] during the Korean Empire period (1902).]]
As a result of the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded between China and Japan. It stipulated the abolition of traditional relationships Korea had with China, the latter of which recognised the complete independence of Joseon and repudiated the former's political influence over the latter.

In 1897, Joseon was renamed the [[Korean Empire]], and King Gojong became [[Emperor Gojong of Korea|Emperor Gojong]]. The imperial government aimed to become a strong and independent nation by implementing domestic reforms; strengthening military forces, developing commerce and industry, and surveying land ownership. Organizations like the [[Independence Club]] also rallied to assert the rights of the Joseon people, but clashed with the government which proclaimed absolute monarchy and power.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 51–55)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian influence was strong in the Empire until being defeated by Japan in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905). Korea effectively became a [[protectorate]] of Japan on 17 November 1905, the [[Eulsa Treaty|1905 Protectorate Treaty]] having been promulgated without Emperor Gojong's required seal or commission.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy of Korean Studies (2005, pp. 58–61)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ki-Baik Lee (1984, pp. 309–317)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the signing of the treaty, many intellectuals and scholars set up various organizations and associations, embarking on movements for independence. In 1907, Gojong was forced to abdicate after Japan learned that he [[Hague Secret Emissary Affair|sent secret envoys]] to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Second Hague Conventions]] to protest against the protectorate treaty, leading to the accession of Gojong's son, [[Emperor Sunjong of Korea|Emperor Sunjong]]. In 1909, independence activist [[An Jung-geun]] assassinated [[Itō Hirobumi]], the [[Resident-General of Korea]], for Ito's intrusions on the Korean politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoare pares japanese rule&quot;&gt;James Hoare, Susan Pares (1988, pp. 50–67)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korea.net/news.do?mode=detail&amp;guid=45163 An Jung-geun], Korea.net&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the Japanese to ban all political organisations and proceed with plans for annexation.

In 1910 [[Japan]] effectively annexed [[Korea]] by the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]], which along with all other prior treaties between Korea and Japan was confirmed to be null and void in 1965. While Japan asserts that the treaty was concluded legally, this argument is generally not accepted in Korea because it was not signed by the Emperor of Korea as required and violated international convention on external pressures regarding treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kawasaki|first=Yutaka|title=Was the 1910 Annexation Treaty Between Korea and Japan Concluded Legally?|journal=Murdoch University Journal of Law|volume=3|issue=2|date=July 1996|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v3n2/kawasaki.html|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/05/11/2010051101277.html Japan's Annexation of Korea 'Unjust and Invalid'], Chosun Ilbo, 2010-05-11.

After [[Emperor Gojong]] died in January 1919, with a rumor of poisoning, independence rallies against Japanese invaders took place nationwide on 1 March 1919 (the [[March 1st Movement]]). This movement was suppressed by force and about 7,000 were killed by Japanese soldiers and police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050797?query=march%20first%20movement&amp;ct= March 1st Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2 million people took part in peaceful, pro-liberation rallies, although Japanese records claim participation of less than half million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ki-Baik Lee 1984, pp. 340-344&quot;&gt;Ki-Baik Lee (1984, pp. 340–344)&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was partly inspired by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s speech of 1919, declaring support for right of self-determination and an end to colonial rule for Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ki-Baik Lee 1984, pp. 340-344&quot;/&gt; No comment was made by Wilson on Korean independence, perhaps as a pro-Japan faction in the USA sought trade inroads into China through the Korean peninsula.

The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] was established in [[Shanghai]], China, in the aftermath of March 1 Movement, which coordinated the Liberation effort and resistance against Japanese control. Some of the achievements of the Provisional Government include the [[Battle of Chingshanli]] of 1920 and the [[Yoon Bong-Gil|ambush of Japanese Military Leadership in China]] in 1932. The Provisional Government is considered to be the de jure government of the Korean people between 1919 and 1948, and its legitimacy is enshrined in the preamble to the [[constitution]] of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp?boardid=1000000035 Constitution of the Republic of Korea: Preamble], The [[National Assembly of the Republic of Korea]]. (In English)&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese]] uprisings, such as the nationwide uprising of students in November 1929, led to the strengthening of military rule in 1931. After the outbreaks of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 and [[World War II]] Japan attempted to exterminate Korea as a nation. The continuance of [[Culture of Korea|Korean culture]] itself began to be illegal. Worship at Japanese [[Shinto]] shrines was made compulsory. The school curriculum was radically modified to eliminate teaching in the Korean language and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoare pares japanese rule&quot;/&gt; The Korean language was banned and Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating Surnames and Changing Given Names (創氏改名)|author= Miyata, Setsuko (宮田 節子) |year=1992|location=Tokyo| publisher= Akashi-shoten (明石書店)|isbn=4-7503-0406-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and newspapers were prohibited from publishing in Korean.

Some [[Koreans]] left the [[Korean peninsula]] to [[Manchuria]] and [[Primorsky Krai]]. Koreans in Manchuria formed resistance groups known as [[Dongnipgun]] (Liberation Army) which would travel in and out of the Korean-Chinese boundary, fighting [[guerrilla warfare]] with the Japanese forces. Some of them would come together in 1940s as [[Korean Liberation Army]] which took part in allied action in China and parts of South East Asia. Tens of thousands of Koreans also joined the [[Peoples Liberation Army]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army]].

During [[World War II]], Koreans at home were forced to support the Japanese war effort. Tens of thousands of men&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan and Foreign Laborers: Chinese and Korean Laborers in the late 1890s and early 1920s (近代日本と外国人労働者―1890年代後半と1920年代前半における中国人・朝鮮人労働者問題)|author= Keizo Yamawaki (山脇 啓造) |year=1994|location=Tokyo| publisher= Akashi-shoten (明石書店)|isbn=4-7503-0568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; were conscripted into Japan's military. Around 200,000 girls and women, mostly from Korea and China, were conscripted into sexual slavery, with the [[euphemism]] &quot;[[comfort women]]&quot;.

At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] on November 22, 1943, it was agreed that &quot;in due course Korea shall become free and independent”;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Hyun-hee (2005, p581);[http://timelines.com/perspectives/161a29f9e4be8f94fbe6e8d306d4e9a2 Cairo Conference is held], Timelines; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a1140364.shtml Cairo Conference], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; at a later meeting in [[Yalta]] in February 1945, it was agreed to establish a four-power trusteeship over Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/yalta.asp Yalta Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tanks entered northern [[Korea]] from [[Siberia]], meeting little resistance. Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces on August 15, 1945.

The unconditional surrender of Japan, combined with fundamental shifts in global politics and ideology, led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones effectively starting on September 8, 1945, with the [[United States]] administering the southern half of the peninsula and the [[Soviet Union]] taking over the area north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. The Provisional Government was ignored, mainly due to American perception that it was too communist-aligned.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edson Robinson (2007, pp. 107–108)&lt;/ref&gt; This division was meant to be temporary and was first intended to return a unified Korea back to its people after the United States, [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] could arrange a single government.

In December 1945, a conference convened in [[Moscow]] to discuss the future of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade19.asp Moscow conference]&lt;/ref&gt; A 5-year trusteeship was discussed, and a joint Soviet-American commission was established. The commission met intermittently in [[Seoul]] but deadlocked over the issue of establishing a national government. In September 1947, with no solution in sight, the [[United States]] submitted the Korean question to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

Initial hopes for a [[Korean reunification|unified]], independent Korea quickly evaporated as the politics of the [[Cold War]] and opposition to the trusteeship plan from anti-communists resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate nations with diametrically opposed political, economic, and social systems. On December 12, 1948, the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]] recognised the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] as the sole legal government of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/66/IMG/NR004366.pdf?OpenElement Resolution 195, UN Third General Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 25, 1950 the [[Korean War]] broke out when North Korea breached the 38th parallel line to invade the South, ending any hope of a peaceful reunification for the time being. After the war, the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva conference]] failed to adopt a solution for a unified Korea. Beginning with [[Syngman Rhee]], a series of oppressive autocratic governments took power in South Korea with American support and influence. The country eventually transitioned to become a market-oriented democracy in 1987 largely due to popular demand for reform, and became a developed economy by the 2000s. Due to the Soviet influence, North Korea established a communist government with a hereditary succession of leadership, with ties to China and Russia.
