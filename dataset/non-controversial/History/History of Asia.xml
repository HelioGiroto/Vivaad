      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13887">The '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].

The coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear lots of root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.

The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]].  These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.

The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts.  The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.

==9000 BC to 4500 BC==
A temple area in southeastern Turkey at [[Göbekli Tepe]] dated to 10000 BC has been seen as the beginning of the &quot;Neolithic 1&quot; culture. This site was developed by nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s since there is no permanent housing in the vicinity. This temple site is the oldest known man-made place of worship.  By 8500–8000 BC farming communities began to spread to [[Anatolia]], North Africa and north [[Mesopotamia]]. 

A report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 8000 BC and 9000 BC associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;archae&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 7000–8000 BC, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and  the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;archdis&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Around 5500 BCE the [[Tel Halaf|Halafian]] culture appeared in the Levant, Lebanon, [[Palestine]], [[Syria]], Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, based upon dryland agriculture.

In southern Mesopotamia were the alluvial plains of [[Sumer]] and [[Elam]]. Since there was little rainfall [[irrigation]] systems were necessary. The [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] culture flourished from 5500 BCE.

==Bronze Age (4500 BC–500 BC)==
{{Main|Ancient Near East|Asian Bronze Age}}
The Chalcolithic period began about 4500 BCE, then the [[Bronze Age]] began about 3500 BCE, replacing the Neolithic cultures. 

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) which was centred mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent, considered as early form of Hinduism performed during this civilization. 

China and [[Vietnam]] were also centres of metalworking. Dating back to the Neolithic Age, the first bronze drums, called the Dong Son drums have been uncovered in and around the Red River Delta regions of Vietnam and Southern China. These relate to the prehistoric Dong Son Culture of Vietnam.

In Ban Chiang, Thailand (Southeast Asia), bronze artifacts have been discovered dating to 2100 BC.

In Nyaunggan, Burma bronze tools have been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still currently broad (3500–500 BC).

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]] of the [[Persian Empire]], founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], ruled an area from [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Indus River]] and Central Asia during the 6th to 4th centuries BC. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered this empire in the 4th century BC. The [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanian]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.

Foundation of the [[Maurya Empire]](Sanskrit: मौर्य राजवंश, Maurya Rājavanśha) which was geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BC.It was one of the world's largest empires in its time. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the Himalayas, and to the east stretching into what is now Assam. To the west, it probably reached beyond modern Pakistan, annexing Balochistan and much of what is now Afghanistan, including the modern Herat and Kandahar provinces. India was united for the first time in the Maurya empire.
The [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: गुप्त राजवंश, Gupta Rājavanśha) was an Ancient Indian empire which existed approximately from 320 to 550 CE and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by Maharaja Sri-Gupta, the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization.Maurya and Gupta empires are called as the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture.The religions of Hinduism and Buddhism, which began in India, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia

The [[Qin Dynasty]] (Chinese: 秦朝; pinyin: Qín Cháo) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC.
The [[Han Dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: 汉朝; traditional Chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: Hàn Cháo ;206 BCE – 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220–265 CE).Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history.To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the &quot;Han people&quot;. 

Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe.

==Middle Ages (600–1500)==
{{main|Medieval Asia}}
The Islamic [[Caliphate]] and other [[Islamic state]]s took over the Middle East, [[Caucasus]] and Central Asia during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, and later expanded into the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Malay archipelago]]. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe.
Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.

[[Chola Dynasty]] of south India, annexed most of south-east Asia during 10th-11th century.
The [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests made limited inroads into the region, beginning during the period of the ascendancy of the [[Rajput]] Kingdoms in North India, although [[Sindh]] and Multan were captured in 8th century..

Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages.

Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as Genghis Khan. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.

The Middle Ages were an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.

The Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331. China flourished again late in the medieval era during the famed Ming Dynasty. In Japan these later Middle Age centuries saw a return to the traditional Shinto faith and the continuing popularity of Zen Buddhism.

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, eventually taking control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]], although this was in decline by the nineteenth century and had been overthrown in 1912. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated second golden age for India. China was largest economy in the world for much of the time followed by India till the 18th century.

The riches of India,China and Ottoman blockading the route led to discovery age in Europe which led to discovery of America,sea route to India etc.

The European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the 1900s, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China.  In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[Second World War]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.

Today China, India, South Korea, Japan and [[Russia]] play important roles in world economics and politics.China today is second largest economy of the world and fastest growing economy. India is the second fastest growing economy with second largest population after China.
