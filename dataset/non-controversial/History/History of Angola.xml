{{Culture of Angola}}
'''Angola''' is a country in southwestern Africa. Its name derives from the [[Kimbundu]] word for king, 'N'gola'. It was first settled by [[Bushmen]] hunter-gatherer societies before the northern domains came under the rule of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]  states such as [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] and [[Ndongo]]. From the 15th century Portuguese colonists began trading and a settlement was established at Luanda in the 16th century. Portugal annexed territories in the region which were [[Colonial history of Angola|ruled as a colony]] from 1655, and [[Angola]] was incorporated as an [[Administrative divisions of Portugal|overseas province]] of Portugal in 1951. After the [[Angolan War of Independence]] (1961–1974) which ended with [[Carnation Revolution|an army mutiny and leftist coup]] in [[Lisbon]], Angola's independence from Portugal was achieved on November 11, 1975 through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. After independence, the country entered a period of [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that ended in 2002.

==From prehistory to the sovereign country==
{{see also|Precolonial history of Angola|Colonial history of Angola|Angolan War of Independence}}
The area of current day [[Angola]] was inhabited during the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] eras, as attested by remains found in Luanda, Congo and the [[Namibe desert]], eventually, at the beginning of recorded history other cultures and people also arrived.

The first ones to settle were the [[Bushmen]], great hunters, similar to [[Pygmies]] in stature. This changed at the beginning of the sixth century AD, when the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], already in possession of metal-working technology, ceramics and agriculture began one of the greatest migrations in history. They came from the north, probably originating from somewhere near the present day [[Republic of Cameroon]]. When they reached what is now Angola they encountered the Bushmen and other groups. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groupings that took on different ethnic characteristics. The first large political entity in the area, known to history as the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], appeared in the thirteenth century and stretched from [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[river Kwanza]] in the south, and from the Atlantic in the west to the [[river Cuango]] in the east.

The wealth of the Kongo came mainly from agriculture. Power was in the hands of the Mani, aristocrats who occupied key positions in the kingdom and who answered only to the all-powerful King of the Kongo. [[Mbanza]] was the name given to a territorial unit administered and ruled by a Mani; [[Mbanza Congo]], the capital, had a population of over fifty thousand in the sixteenth century.

The Kingdom of Kongo was divided into six provinces and included some dependent kingdoms, such as [[Ndongo]] to the south. Trade was the main activity, based on highly productive agriculture and increasing exploitation of mineral wealth. In 1482, [[Portuguese caravel]]s commanded by [[Diogo Cão]] arrived in the Congo. Other expeditions followed, and close relations were soon established between the two states. The Portuguese brought [[firearms]] and many other [[technological]] advances, as well as a new religion ([[Christianity]]); in return, the King of the Congo offered plenty of [[slave]]s, [[ivory]], and [[minerals]].

The [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony of Angola]] was founded in 1575 with the arrival of [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers. Luanda was granted the status of city in 1605.

The King of the Kongo soon converted to Christianity, and adopted a similar political structure to the Europeans; he became a well-known figure in Europe, to the point of receiving missives from the [[Pope]] himself.

To the south of the Kingdom of the Kongo, around the river Kwanza, there were various important states, of which the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], ruled by the Ngola (King), was the most significant. At the time of the arrival of the Portuguese, Ngola [[Kiluange]] was in power, and by maintaining a policy of alliances with neighbouring states, managed to hold out against the foreigners for several decades. Eventually he was beheaded in [[Luanda]]. Years later, the Ndongo rose to prominence again when Jinga Mbandi, known as [[Queen Jinga]], took power. A wily politician, she kept the Portuguese in check with carefully prepared agreements. After undertaking various journeys she succeeded in 1635 in forming a grand coalition with the states of [[Matamba]] and Ndongo, Kongo, [[Kassanje]], [[Dembos]] and [[Kissamas]]. At the head of this formidable alliance, she forced the Portuguese to retreat.

Meanwhile, Portugal had lost its King and the Spanish took control of the Portuguese monarchy. By this time, Portugal's overseas territories had taken second place. The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] took advantage of this situation and occupied Luanda in 1641. Jinga entered into an alliance with the Dutch, thereby strengthening her coalition and confining the Portuguese to [[Massangano]], which they fortified strongly, sallying forth on occasion to capture slaves in the [[Kuata! Kuata! Wars]]. Slaves from Angola were essential to the development of the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]], but the traffic had been interrupted by these events. In 1648, after Portugal has regained its independence from the Spanish rulers in 1640, a large Portuguese force from Brazil under the command of [[Salvador Correia de Sá]] retook Luanda, leading to the return of the Portuguese in large numbers.

Jinga's coalition began to fall apart; the absence of their Dutch allies with their firearms, and the strong position of Correia de Sá, delivered a deadly blow to the morale of the native forces. Jinga died in 1663; two years later, the King of the Congo committed all his forces to an attempt to capture the island of Luanda, occupied by Correia de Sá, but they were defeated and lost their independence. The [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] likewise submitted to the Portuguese Crown in 1671.

Trade was mostly with the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Slave-trading routes and the conquests that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; independent states were subjugated to the demands of American slavery{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of [[Bi%C3%A9_(province)|Bié]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of the twentieth century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

The slave trade was not abolished until 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. This facilitated the continuation of slave smuggling to the United States and Brazil. By 1850, Luanda was one of the largest Portuguese cities in the [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]] exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products - almost all the produce of a continued forced labour system.

The [[Berlin Conference]] compelled Portugal to move towards the immediate occupation of all the   territories it laid claimed to but had been unable to effectively conquer. The territory of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]], to the north of the river Zaire, was also ceded to Portugal on the legal basis of the [[Treaty of Simulambuko]] Protectorate, concluded between the [[Portuguese Crown]] and the princes of Cabinda in 1885. After a brutal and complicated process of conquest, the end of the nineteenth century saw the establishment of a colonial administration based directly on the territory and the people to be ruled.

With regard to the economy, colonial strategy was based on [[agriculture]] and the export of [[raw material]]s. Trade in [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], together with the taxes imposed on the population of the Empire (including the mainland), brought vast income to [[Lisbon]].

Portuguese policy in Angola was modified by certain reforms introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. The fall of the Portuguese monarchy and a favourable international climate led to reforms in administration, agriculture, and education. With the advent of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] regime (''Estado Novo'') extended to the colony, in 1951 Angola became a province of Portugal (Ultramarine Province), called the ''Província Ultramarina de Angola'' ([[Overseas Province of Angola]]).

However, Portuguese rule remained characterised by deep-seated racism, mass forced labour and an almost complete failure to modernize the country. By 1960, after 400 years of colonial tyranny, there was not a single university in the entire territory &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uan.ao/.  Agostinho Neto University&lt;/ref&gt;  To counter this backwardness, more overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s, and began to make organized demands for human and civil rights, initiating diplomatic campaigns throughout the world in their fight for independence. The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the nationalist]s' demands for independence, thereby provoking the armed conflict that started in 1961 when guerrillas attacked colonial assets in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. &lt;ref&gt; See Christine Messiant, ''L’Angola colonial, histoire et société: Les prémisses du mouvement nationaliste'', Basle: Schlettwein, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;

In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the [[MPLA]] (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA ([[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA ([[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict, the nation gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'état]] in the  [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Portugal's new leaders began a process of democratic change at home and acceptance of its former colonies' independence abroad.

==Civil war==
{{main|Angolan Civil War}}
A [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'état]] in Portugal established a military government led by President [[António de Spínola]]. The Spínola government agreed to give all of Portugal's colonies independence, and handed power in Angola over to a coalition of the three, largest, separatist movements, the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA, through the [[Alvor Agreement]]. The coalition quickly broke down, however, and the country descended into civil war. The MPLA gained control of the capital Luanda and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, [[Zaïre]] and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, [[Cuba]] intervened in favor of the MPLA (see: [[Cuba in Angola]]). In the meantime the South Africans and UNITA had come as close as 200&amp;nbsp;km to the south of the capital, the FNLA and Zairean forces as far as Kifangondo, 30&amp;nbsp;km to the east.

With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on November 11, 1975, the day the Portuguese left the country. [[Agostinho Neto]] became the first president. FNLA and UNITA proclaimed their own short-lived republics (the Democratic Republic of Angola and the Social Democratic Republic of Angola) on November 24, 1975, for the zones they controlled with [[Holden Roberto]] and [[Jonas Savimbi]] as co-presidents (dissolved after January 30, 1976). By the end of January 1976 the Angolan army (FAPLA) and the Cubans had all but crushed FNLA, Zaireans and UNITA, and the South African forces withdrew.

The proxy war continued. The Angolan government, recognised internationally (although not by the United States), requested that Cuban forces remain in the country. Led by Jonas Savimbi, UNITA received clandestine support from the U.S. and other nations and took up military resistance in the southeast of the country while the Angolan government was supported by the USSR and Eastern Bloc countries.  South Africa continued to pursue [[South-West Africa People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) forces in Southern Angola, soon established bases and increased support of UNITA, which gained control of more and more territory. In an effort to deliver a final blow to UNITA and to drive South Africa out of the country, in 1987 the [[Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola|People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA), with Soviet support, launched a campaign fraught with failures and defeats. Again, the Cubans intervened, stopping UNITA and South African advances, leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] from January 13 to March 23, the largest battle in African history since World War II.

Angola and the U.S. had been in negotiations for a peaceful solution since June 1987. The U.S. agreed to include Cuba in direct talks. Cuba joined the negotiations January 28, 1988; South Africa joined March 9. Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] on December 22, 1988, in which the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola was linked to the retreat of South African soldiers from Angola and Namibia.

The [[Bicesse Accord]] in 1991 spelled out an electoral process for a democratic Angola under the supervision of the [[United Nations]]. MPLA won the first round with 49% of the votes, against 40% for UNITA. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the results and returned to war. A second peace accord, the [[Lusaka Protocol]], was brokered in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] and signed on November 20, 1994.

The peace accord between the government and UNITA provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the government and armed forces.  However, in 1995, localized fighting resumed. A national unity government was installed in April 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998 when Savimbi renewed the war for a second time, claiming that the MPLA was not fulfilling its obligations. The [[UN Security Council]] voted on August 28, 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA. The Angolan military launched a massive offensive in 1999 that destroyed UNITA's conventional capacity and recaptured all major cities previously held by Savimbi's forces. Savimbi then declared that UNITA would return to guerrilla tactics, and much of the country remained in turmoil.

The extended civil war rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century. It only ended when Savimbi was killed in 2002.

A Russian freighter delivered 500 tons of Ukrainian 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition to Simportex, a division of the Angolan government, with the help of a shipping agent in London on September 21, 2000. The ship's captain declared his cargo &quot;fragile&quot; to minimize inspection.&lt;ref name=&quot;cargo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2001|url=http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/angola/index-05.htm|title=The Oil Diagnostic in Angola: An Update|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the MPLA began attacking UNITA, winning victories in several battles from September 22&amp;ndash;25. The government gained control over military bases and diamond mines in [[Lunda Norte]] and [[Lunda Sul]], hurting Savimbi's ability to pay his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;safricainvasion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|coauthors=Langer, William Leonard|year=2001|title=The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged|page=1065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola agreed to trade oil to Slovakia in return for arms, buying six [[Sukhoi Su-17]] [[attack aircraft]] on April 3, 2000. The Spanish government in the [[Canary Islands]] prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636 tons of military equipment to Angola on February 24, 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from [[Rosoboronexport|Rosvooruzhenie]], the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;cargo&quot;/&gt;

After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all [[military operation]]s on March 13. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in [[Cassamba]] and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said that the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured more than a week earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the [[Lusaka Protocol]] in [[Luena]] on April 4, Dos Santos and Lukambo observing.&lt;ref name=&quot;endofwar&quot;&gt;Crocker, Aall, and Osler (2004).

The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1404|Resolution 1404]] on April 18, extending the monitoring mechanism of sanctions by six months. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1412|Resolutions 1412]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1432|1432]], passed on May 17 and August 15 respectively, suspended the UN travel ban on UNITA officials for 90 days each, finally abolishing the ban through [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1439|Resolution 1439]] on October 18. UNAVEM III, extended an additional two months by Resolution 1439, ended on December 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;unres&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/Angola/AngolaResEng.htm|title=Security Council Resolutions Concerning the Situation in Angola Pursuant to Resolution 864 (1993)|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2002, UNITA declared itself a political party and officially demobilised its armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;polonly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2005|url=http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/Angola2005.pdf|title=Polity IV Country Report 2005: Angola|format=PDF|publisher=Center for Systematic Peace|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the United Nations Security Council replaced the United Nations Office in Angola with the United Nations Mission in Angola, a larger, non-military, political presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Furley|first=Oliver|coauthors=Roy May|year=2006|title=Ending Africa's Wars: Progressing to Peace|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war internally displaced four million people (IDPs), one third of Angola's population. The government spent $187 million settling IDPs between April 4, 2002 and 2004, after which the [[World Bank]] gave $33 million to continue the settling process. Militant forces laid approximately 15 million [[landmine]]s by 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;/&gt; The [[HALO Trust]] charity began demining in 1994, destroying 30,000 by July 2007. There are 1,100 Angolans and seven foreign workers who are working for HALO Trust in Angola, with operations expected to finish sometime between 2011 and 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;halo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Bobb|year=2007|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-24-voa17.cfm|title=Work intensifies to clear Angola's landmines|publisher=Voice of America News|accessdate=2007-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114094945/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-24-voa17.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] estimates UNITA and the government employed more than 86,000 and 3,000 [[child soldier]]s respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Human rights analysts found 5,000 to 8,000 underage girls married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food to provide for the troops. If the girls did not bring back enough food as judged by their commander, then the girls would not eat. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women who were often then sexually abused. The government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army and relocated seventy of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;childsoldiers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2006|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/angola0403/Angola0403-03.htm|title=IV.

Fernando Vendrell produced and Zézé Gamboa directed ''[[The Hero (2004 film)|The Hero]]'', a film about the life of average Angolans after the civil war, in 2004. The film follows the lives of three individuals; Vitório, a [[war veteran]] crippled by a landmine who returns to Luanda, Manu, a young boy searching for his soldier father, and Joana, a teacher who mentors the boy and begins a love affair with Vitório. ''The Hero'' won the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] World Dramatic Cinema Jury Grand Prize. A joint Angolan, Portuguese, and French production, Gamboa filmed ''The Hero'' entirely in Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;award&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Unknown|year=2005|url=http://www.newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0173|title=The Hero|publisher=California Newsreel|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
