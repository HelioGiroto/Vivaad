{{History of Thailand}}
[[Tai peoples]] who originally lived in [[southwestern China]], migrated into [[mainland Southeast Asia]] over a period of many centuries. The oldest known mention of their existence in the region by the [[exonym]] ''Siamese'' is in a 12th century A.D. inscription at the [[Khmer architecture|Khmer]] temple complex of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], which refers to ''syam'', or &quot;dark brown&quot; people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The country's designation as Siam by Westerners likely came from [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the first Europeans to give a coherent account of the country. Portuguese chronicles noted that the king of [[Trailokanat#Expedition to Malacca|Sukhothai had sent an expedition]] to [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] at the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in 1455. Following their [[Portuguese Malacca|conquest of Malacca]] in 1511, the Portuguese sent a diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya.

[[Indianized kingdom]]s such as the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]], [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] kingdoms had ruled the region. [[Thai people]] established their own states starting with [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Amphoe Chiang Saen|Chiang Saen]] and [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Lanna Kingdom]] and then [[Ayutthaya kingdom]]. These states fought each other and were under constant threat from the [[Khmers]], [[Burma]] and [[Vietnam]]. Much later, the [[Europe]]an colonial powers threatened in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but Thailand survived as the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to avoid European [[colonialism|colonial]] rule because the French and the English decided it would be a [[neutral territory]] to avoid conflicts between their colonies. After the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand endured sixty years of almost permanent [[military]] rule before the establishment of a [[democratic]] elected-government system.
==Prehistoric Thailand==
{{main|Prehistoric Thailand}}
==Initial states of Thailand==

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Prior to the southwards [[Human migration|migration]] of the [[Tai people]] from [[Yunnan]] in the 10th century, the [[Indochina peninsula]] had been a home to various indigenous [[animist]]ic communities for as far back as 500,000 years ago. The recent discovery of [[Homo erectus]] [[fossils]] such as [[Prehistoric Thailand|Lampang man]] is but one example. The remains were first discovered during excavations in [[Lampang]] province, [[Thailand]]. The finds have been dated from roughly 1,000,000-500,000 years ago in the [[Pleistocene]]. There are myriad sites in Thailand dating to the Bronze (1500 BC-500 BC) and Iron Ages (500 BC-AD 500). The most thoroughly researched of these sites are located in the country's Northeast, especially in the [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River|Chi]] River valleys. The Mun River in particular is home to many 'moated' sites which comprise mounds surrounded by ditches and ramparts. The mounds contain evidence of prehistoric occupation.

Around the 1st century AD, according to [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] [[epigraphy]] and the records of [[China|Chinese]] [[historian]]s (Coedes), a number of [[Trade|trading]] settlements of the South appear to have been organized into several Malay states, among the earliest of which are believed to be [[Langkasuka]] and [[Tambralinga]]. Some trading settlements show evidences of [[Roman Empire|Roman trade]]: a Roman gold coin showing Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]]  (161 AD) has been found in southern Thailand.

==Ancient civilizations==
Prior to the arrival of the Tai people and culture into what is now Thailand, the region hosted a number of indigenous [[Mon-Khmer]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] civilizations. Yet little is known about Thailand before the 13th century as the literary and concrete sources are scarce and most of the knowledge about this period is gleaned from archeological evidence.

===Dvaravati===
{{main|Dvaravati}}
[[File:Wat Dhammachaksemaram-HDR.jpg|thumb|250px|A 13 meter long reclining Buddha, [[Nakhon Ratchasima]]]]
The [[Chao Phraya]] valley in what is now Central Thailand had once been the home of [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Dvaravati]] culture, which prevailed from the 7th century to the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Wyatt, ''A Short History of Thailand'' (Yale University Press: New Haven, Connecticutt, 2003) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of the civilizations had long been forgotten by the Thai when Samuel Beal discovered the polity among the Chinese writings on Southeast Asia as “Tou-lo-po-ti”. During the early 20th century the archeologists led by [[George Coedès]] made grand excavations on what is now [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakorn Pathom]] and found it to be a center of Dvaravati culture. The constructed name Dvaravati was confirmed by a [[Sanskrit]] plate inscription containing the name “Dvaravati”.
[[File:Vishnu-khmer.jpg|thumb|110px|right|Khmer period sculpture of Vishnu, ~10th century]]
Later on, many more Dvaravati sites were discovered throughout the Chao Phraya valley. The two most important sites were Nakorn Pathom and [[Uthong]] (in the present [[Suphanburi Province]]). The inscriptions of Dvaravati were in Sanskrit and Mon using the script derived from the [[Pallava script]] of the [[Pallava dynasty]]. The religion of Dvaravati is thought to be [[Theravada]] through contacts with [[Sri Lanka]], with the ruling class also participating in [[Hindu]] rites. The Dvaravati art, including the Buddha sculptures and [[stupa]]s, showed strong similarities to those of the [[Gupta dynasty]]. The most prominent production of Dvaravati art are the ''Thammachakra''s or the Stone Wheels signifying Buddhist principles. The eastern parts of the Chao Phraya valley were subjected to a more Khmer and Hindu influence as the inscriptions are found in Khmer and Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L. (1996). ''The Dvaravati wheels of law and the Indianization of South East Asia''. Leiden:E.J.Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaravati was not a kingdom but a network of city-states paying tributes to more powerful ones according to the ''[[Mandala (Southeast Asian history)|mandala]]'' model. Dvaravati culture expanded into Isan as well as southwards as far as the [[Isthmus of Kra]]. Dvaravati was a part of ancient international trade as Roman artifacts were also found and Dvaravati tributes to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] court are recorded. The culture came to an end around the 10th century when it was replaced by a more unified Lavo-Khmer polity.

===Si Kottaboon===
In what is considered as present day Isan another Indianized kingdom of Si Kottaboon rose with the capital of Nakhon Phanom. The territory of Si Khottaboon covered mostly in northern Isan and central Laos.

===Southern Thailand===
Below the Isthmus of Kra was the place of Malay civilizations. Primordial Malay kingdoms are described as tributaries to Funan by 2nd century Chinese sources – though most of them proved to be tribal organizations instead of full-fledged kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacq-Hergoualc'h, Michel, &amp;Hobson, Victoria. (2002). ''Malay Peninsula: crossroads of maritime silkroads''. Leiden:Koninkijke Brill N.V.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 6th century onwards, two major mandalas ruled Southern Thailand – the Kanduli and the [[Langkasuka]]. Kanduli centered on what is now [[Surat Thani Province]] and Langasuka on [[Pattani]]. Southern Thailand was the center of Hinduism and [[Mahayana]]. The [[Tang dynasty]] monk [[I Ching (monk)|I Ching]] stopped at Langkasuka to study [[Pali]] grammar and Mahayana during his journey to India around 800 AD. At that time, the kingdoms of Southern Thailand quickly fell under the influences of the Malay kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] from [[Sumatra]].

==Classical era==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
From about the 10th century to the 14th century Thailand was known through archeological findings and a number of local legends. The period saw the Khmer domination over a large portion of Chao Phraya basin and the Isan. The expansion of Tai people and culture southwards also happened during the classical era.

===Hariphunchai===
{{main|Hariphunchai}}
[[File:Wat-Kukut-Lamphun-3.jpg|thumb|A Buddha from Wat Kukkut, [[Lamphun]]]]
According to the Jamadevivamsa, the city of Hariphunchai (modern [[Lamphun]]) was founded by the hermits; [[Jamadevi]], a Lavo princess, was invited to rule the city in around 700 AD. However, the date is considered too early for the foundation of Hariphunchai as Jamadevi brought no Thammachakras to the north. Hariphunchai may be a later (about the 10th century) offshoot of the Lavo kingdom or instead related to the [[Thaton]] kingdom.

Hariphunchai was the center of Theravada in the north. The kingdom flourished during the reign of King Attayawong who built the [[Dhatu of Hariphunchai]] in 1108. The kingdom had strong relations to another Mon kingdom of Thaton. During the 11th century, Hariphunchai waged lengthy wars with the Tai [[Ngoenyang]] kingdom of Chiang Saen. Weakened by Tai invasions, Hariphunchai eventually fell in 1293 to [[Mangrai the Great]], king of [[Lanna]], the successor state of the Ngoenyang kingdom.

===Arrival of the Tais===
The most recent and accurate theory about the origin of the Tai people stipulates that [[Guangxi]] province in [[China]] is really the Tai motherland instead of [[Yunnan]] province. A large number of Tai people, known as the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], still live in Guangxi today. Around 700 AD, Tai people who did not come under Chinese influence settled in what is now [[Dien Bien Phu]] in modern [[Vietnam]] according to the [[Khun Borom]] legend. From there, the Tais began to radiate into northern highlands and founded the cities of [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Amphoe Chiang Saen|Chiang Saen]]. 

The ''Simhanavati legend'' tells us that a Tai chief named [[Simhanavati]] drove out the native [[Wa people]] and founded the city of Chiang Saen around 800 AD. For the first time, the Tai people made contact with the [[India]]nized civilizations of Southeast Asia. Through Hariphunchai, the Tais of Chiang Saen adopted Theravada Buddhism and [[Sanskrit]] royal names. The [[Dhatu of Doi Tung]], constructed around 850 AD, signified the piety of Tai people on the Theravada religion. Around 900 AD, major wars were fought between Chiang Saen and Hariphunchai. The Mon forces captured Chiang Saen and its king fled. In 937, Prince Prom the Great took Chiang Saen back from the Mon and inflicted severe defeats on Hariphunchai. 

Around 1000 AD, Chiang Saen was destroyed by an earthquake with all the inhabitants killed. A council was established to govern the kingdom for a while, and then a local Wa man known as Lavachakkaraj was elected the King of the new city of Chiang Saen or [[Ngoenyang]]. The Lavachakkaraj dynasty would rule over the region for about 500 years.

The overpopulation might have encouraged the Tais to seek their fortune further southwards. By 1100 AD, the Tai had established themselves as ''Po Khun''s (ruling fathers) at [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]], [[Phrae]], Songkwae, [[Sawankhalok]], Chakangrao, etc. on the upper [[Chao Phraya]] valley. These southern Tai princes faced Khmer influence from [[Lavo]]. Some of them became subordinates to the Lavo-Khmer polity.

===Chao Phraya Basin under the Tai===
There are several legends about the Tai coming to rule [[Mandala (Southeast Asian history)|mandalas]] of Central Thailand including Lavo and Suphannabhum. The Suphannabhum mandala had been independent from Khmer influence and composed originally the Western Provinces of modern Thailand including [[Suphanburi]], [[Ratchaburi]], and [[Phetchaburi]]. 

In the 12th century, the Tai ''Po Khun''s of the upper Chao Phraya coalesced around the ''Po Khun'' of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] - an important Khmer outpost. With the weakened Khmer authority, ''Po Khun'' Si Nau Namthom of Sukhothai gained the autonomy of upper Chao Phraya valley. However, during the reign of [[Jayavarman VII]], the Khmer power was strengthened and the Tai ''Po Khun''s were subdued and brought under Khmer suzerainty. Suphannabhum was also weakened by Khmer invasions and only the city of Suphanburi itself was left.

===Lavo===
{{main|Lavo kingdom}}
[[File:Wat Phra Prang Sam Yod-001.jpg|thumb|The Khmer temple of Wat Phra Prang Sam Yod in [[Lopburi]]]]
Around the 10th century, the city-states of Dvaravati merged into two mandalas – the Lavo (modern [[Lopburi]]) and the Supannabhum (modern [[Suphanburi]]). According to a legend in the Northern Chronicles, in 903, a king of [[Tambralinga]] invaded and took Lavo and installed a Malay prince to the Lavo throne. The Malay prince was married to a Khmer princess who had fled an Angkorian dynastic bloodbath. The son of the couple contested for the Khmer throne and became [[Suryavarman I]], thus bringing Lavo under Khmer domination through [[personal union]]. Suryavarman I also expanded into the [[Khorat Plateau]] (later styled [[Isan]]), constructing many temples.

Suryavarman, however, had no male heirs and again Lavo was independent. King [[Anawratha]] of [[Bagan]] invaded Lavo in 1057 and took a Lavo princess as his wife. The power of the Lavo kingdom reached the zenith in the reign of Narai (1072–1076). Lavo faced Burmese invasions under [[Kyanzittha]], whose mother was the Lavo princess, in 1080 but was able to repel. After the death of Narai, however, Lavo was plunged into bloody civil war and the Khmer under [[Suryavarman II]] took advantage by invading Lavo and installing his son as the King of Lavo. 

The repeated but discontinued Khmer domination eventually &quot;Khmerized&quot; Lavo. Lavo was transformed from a [[Theravada|Theravadic]] Monic Dvaravati city into a Hindu Khmer one. Lavo became the [[entrepôt]] of Khmer culture and power of the Chao Phraya river basin. The bas-relief at [[Angkor Wat]] showed a Lavo army as one of the subordinates to Angkor. However, one interesting note is that a Tai army was shown as a part of Lavo army, a century before the establishment of the Sukhothai kingdom.

==Sukhothai and Lanna==

[[File:Sukhothai Historical Park.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Wat Mahathat, [[Sukhothai Historical Park]]]]
[[Image:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Phra Achana, Wat Si Chum, Sukhothai Historical Park]]
Thai city-states  gradually became independent from the weakened [[Khmer Empire]]. It is said that [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established as a sovereign, strong kingdom by [[Si Intharathit|Pho Khun Si Indrathit]] in 1238 AD. A political feature which &quot;classic&quot; Thai historians call &quot;[[father governs children]]&quot; existed at this time. Everybody could bring their problems to the king directly, as there was a bell in front of the palace for this purpose. The city briefly dominated the area under King [[Ram Khamhaeng the Great|Ramkhamhaeng]], who established the [[Thai script|Thai alphabet]], but after his death in 1365, Sukothai fell into decline and became subject to another emerging Thai state: the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the lower Chao Phraya area.

Another Thai state that coexisted with Sukhothai was the eastern state of [[Lanna]], centred in [[Chiang Mai]]. King Phya [[Mangrai]] was its founder. This city-state emerged in the same period as Sukhothai. Evidently Lanna became closely allied with Sukhothai. After the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] had emerged and expanded its influence from the Chao Phraya valley, Sukhothai was finally subdued. Fierce battles between Lanna and Ayutthaya also constantly took place and Chiang Mai was eventually subjugated, becoming Ayutthaya's 'vassal'.

Lanna's independent history ended in 1558, when it finally fell to the Burmese; thereafter it was dominated by Burma until the late 18th century. Local leaders then rose up against the Burmese with the help of the rising Thai kingdom of [[Thonburi]] of king [[Taksin]]. The 'Northern City-States' then became vassals of the lower Thai kingdoms of Thonburi and Bangkok. In the early 20th century they were annexed and became part of modern Siam, the country now called Thailand.

==Ayutthaya==
{{main|Ayutthaya kingdom}}

[[File:Birmanie 2. battle betwenn Burmese and Siamese ok fini +.jpg|thumb|Siamese King [[Naresuan]] fighting the Burmese crown prince Mingyi Swa at the battle of Yuthahatthi in January 1593.]]
[[File:Ayutthaya 17th century.jpg|thumb|Ayutthaya in the 17th century]]

The city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] was located on a small island, encircled by three rivers. Due to its superior location, Ayutthaya quickly became powerful, politically and economically. Ayutthaya had different, various names ranging from 'Ayothaya', derived from Ayodhya, an Indian holy city,'Krung Thep', 'Phra Nakorn' and 'Dvaravati'.

The first ruler of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, King [[Ramathibodi I]] (ruled 1351 to 1369), made two important contributions to Thai history: the establishment and promotion of [[Theravada]] Buddhism as the official religion – to differentiate his kingdom from the neighbouring [[Hindu]] kingdom of Angkor – and the compilation of the [[Dharmashastra]], a legal code based on Hindu sources and traditional Thai custom. The Dharmashastra remained a tool of Thai law until late in the 19th century. In the 417 years of existence, the Ayutthaya kingdom was frequently plagued by internal fighting but this did not prevent its rise as a major power on mainland Southeast Asia. 

Ayutthaya's culture and traditions became the model for the next period in Thai history, the Bangkok based [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty]].

Beginning with arrival of Portuguese ambassador [[Duarte Fernandes]] in 1511, Ayutthaya, known to the Europeans as 'Kingdom of Siam', came into contact with the West during the 16th century. It became one of the most prosperous cities in East Asia. According to [[George Modelski]], Ayutthaya is estimated to have been the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world]] in 1700 CE, with a population of around 1 million.&lt;ref name=Modelski&gt;[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: –3000 to 2000'', Washington DC: FAROS 2000, 2003.  ISBN 0-9676230-1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade flourished with the Dutch and French among the most active foreigners in the kingdom together with the Chinese and Japanese. 

The Ayutthaya period is known as &quot;Golden age of medicine in Thailand&quot; due to progress in the field of medicine at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rong Syamananda, ''A history of Thailand'', [[Chulalongkorn University]], 1986, p 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Year 1563 a.d., 15 years after Suriyothai died, Prince Bayinnong Ascended to the throne as the King of Hongsawadee, the heir of the King Tabengchaweti.he led his army past Maelamao border taking over the Northern cities on his way to the Kingdom of Ayodhya. Once King Bayinnong had control over Kampaenphet, Sukhothai and Sawankhalok, he led his forces to the northern kingdom of Phitisanulok. King Bayinnong Defeated Phitisanulok taken the eldest son of the King of Phitisanulok,Prince Ong Dam. (or Prince Naresuan)Prince Ekkathat is Prince Naresuan Younger Brother that trained Military skills and tradition of Burma and in 1581 King Bayinnong died of an illness from his coming of a conflict battle against the Kingdom of Yakkai.The son of King Bayinnong became King afterwards. Some of the Northern states revolted against Hongsadee including Phitsanulok Ayodhya, and Mon. To gain their Independence. 

Ayutthaya expanded its sphere of influence over a considerable area, ranging from the [[Islamic]] states on the [[Malay Peninsula]], the Andaman ports of present day Myanmar, the [[Khmer Empire|Angkor kingdom]] of Cambodia, to states in northern Thailand. In the 18th century, the power of the Ayutthaya Kingdom gradually declined as fighting between princes and officials plagued its political arena. Outlying principalities became more and more independent, ignoring the capital's orders and decrees.

In the 18th century, the last phase of the kingdom arrived. The [[Bamar|Burmese]], who had taken control of Lanna and had also unified their kingdom under the powerful [[Konbaung Dynasty]], launched several blows against Ayutthaya in the 1750s and 1760s. Finally, in 1767, after several months of siege, the Burmese broke through Ayutthaya's walls, sacked the city and burned it down. The royal family fled the city and Ayutthaya's last king [[Ekkathat]] died of starvation ten days later while in hiding. The Ayutthaya royal line had been extinguished. Overall there had been 33 kings in this period, including an unofficial king. 

Five dynasties ruled the Ayutthaya Kingdom:
#U-Thong Dynasty which consisting of 3 kings
#Suphanabhumi Dynasty consisting of 13 kings
#Sukhothai Dynasty consisting of 7 kings
#Prasart Thong (Golden Palace) Dynasty consisting of 4 kings
#Bann Plu Dynasty consisting of 6 kings

==Thonburi and Bangkok period==
{{main|History of Thailand (1768–1932)}}

After more than 400 years of power, in 1767, the Kingdom of Ayutthaya was brought down by invading [[Burma|Burmese]] armies, its capital burned, and the territory split. General [[Taksin]] (now known as King Taksin the Great) managed to reunite the Thai kingdom from his new capital of [[Thonburi]] and declared himself king in 1769. However, later due to stress and many factors, King Taksin went mad. General Chakri (later becoming Rama I) helped run the empire instead. The King Taksin ordained as a monk and ventured into the forest and never to be seen again. General Chakri succeeded him in 1782 as [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Rama I]], the first king of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. In the same year he founded the new capital city at [[Bangkok]], across the [[Chao Phraya]] river from Thonburi, Taksin's capital. In the 1790s Burma was defeated and driven out of [[Thailand|Siam]], as it was then called. Lanna also became free of Burmese occupation, but the king of a new dynasty who was installed in the 1790s was effectively a tributary ruler of the Chakri monarch.

The heirs of Rama I became increasingly concerned with the threat of European colonialism after British victories in neighboring Burma in 1826. The first Thai recognition of Western power in the region was the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (UK-Siam)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1826. In 1833, the [[United States]] began diplomatic exchanges with Siam, as Thailand was called until 1939, and again between 1945 and 1949. However, it was during the later reigns of King [[Mongkut]] (1804–1868), and his son King [[Chulalongkorn]] (1853–1910), that Thailand established firm rapprochement with Western powers. It is a widely held view in Thailand that the diplomatic skills of these monarchs, combined with the modernising reforms of the Thai government, made Siam the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid European [[colonisation]]. This is reflected in the country's modern name, ''Prathet Thai'' or ''Thai‐land'', used since 1939 (although the name was reverted to Siam during 1945–49), in which ''prathet'' means &quot;nation&quot;.

The [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]] defined the modern border between Siam and [[British Malaya]] by securing Thai authority over the provinces of [[Pattani province|Pattani]], [[Yala province|Yala]], [[Narathiwat province|Narathiwat]] and [[Satun province|Satun]], which were previously part of the semi‐independent Malay sultanates of Pattani and [[Kedah]]. A series of treaties with [[France]] fixed the country's current eastern border with Laos and [[Cambodia]].

==End of absolute monarchy, and military rule==
{{main|History of Thailand (1932–1973)}}

The [[Siamese revolution of 1932]] was led by a group of young military officers and civil servants. The group held key figures, ministers who were of the royal blood as hostages while the king, [[Rama VII]], was at the summer palace in [[Hua Hin]]. The coup, usually called 'The Revolution of 1932', transformed the Government of Thailand from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy. The cabinet was presided by the prime minister. Military men always played a significant role in the politics even before 1932. Already in 1912, during the Rama VI reign, young soldiers who had plotted a coup urging a constitution and a change of the king's status had been arrested.

King Rama VII, [[Prajadhipok]] initially accepted this change, granting the Constitution but later abdicated from his position due to conflicts with the government. The revolutionary government decided to install his ten year old nephew, [[Ananda Mahidol]] as the new monarch. Upon his abdication, King Prajadhipok said that the duty of a ruler was to reign for the good of the whole people, not for a selected few. Within a decade Thai politics ran into turmoil as the revolutionary government plunged into factions; military and civilian figures. Fear of communism, extreme revolutionary ideas and ultranationalism caused the sharp fighting among the new ruling elites.
Eventually the military faction emerged. The regime became authoritarian under the prime minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], one of the members of the Revolutionary military wing. His regime was also famous in promoting the 'Pan - Thaism', the ultra - nationalist policy aiming at unifying Tai, Thai - speaking people nearby into the kingdom. Moreover, in 1941, Phibun regime decided to ally with Japan.

The young King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) died in 1946 under somewhat mysterious circumstances, the official explanation being that he shot himself by accident while cleaning his gun. He was succeeded by his brother [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], the longest reigning king of Thailand, and very popular with the Thais. Although nominally a constitutional monarchy, Thailand was ruled by a series of military governments, most prominently led by [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and [[Sarit Dhanarajata]], interspersed with brief periods of democracy.

In early January 1941, Thailand invaded [[French Indochina]], beginning the [[French-Thai War]]. The Thais, well equipped and slightly outnumbering the French forces, easily reclaimed Laos. The French, outnumbering the Thai navy force, decisively won the naval [[Battle of Koh Chang]].
[[File:POWs Burma Thai RR.jpg|thumb|Australian and Dutch prisoners of war at Tarsau in Thailand, 1943]]
The Japanese mediated the conflict, and a general armistice was declared on January 28. On May 9 a peace treaty was signed in [[Tokyo]], with the French being coerced by the Japanese into relinquishing their hold on the disputed territories.

On December 8, 1941, a few hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], [[Japan]] demanded the right to move troops across Thailand to the Malayan frontier. [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand|Japan invaded Thailand]] and engaged the Thai army for six to eight hours before Phibunsongkhram ordered an armistice. Shortly thereafter Japan was granted free passage, and on December 21, 1941, Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance with a secret protocol wherein Tokyo agreed to help Thailand regain territories lost to the British and French (i.e. the Shan States of Burma, Malaya, Singapore, &amp; part of Yunnan, plus Laos &amp; Cambodia) Subsequently, Thailand undertook to 'assist' Japan in its war against the Allies. Japan's distrust of Thailand extended to the point of rearming their 'ally' with controlled munitions, including the famous [[Siamese Mauser]], which was manufactured in an unusual caliber. The Seri Thai ([[Free Thai Movement]]) was an underground resistance movement against Japan founded by [[Seni Pramoj]], the Thai ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with the assistance of the [[United States Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS.) Led from within Thailand from the office of the [[regent]] [[Pridi]], it operated freely, often with support from members of the Royal family such as Prince [[Chula Chakrabongse]], and members of the government.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, due to the help of  Seri Thai, American support mitigated Allied terms, although the British demanded repatriations in the form of rice sent to Malaya, and the French, return of territories lost in the [[Franco-Thai War]]. In exchange for supporting Thailand's admission to the [[United Nations]], the [[Soviet Union]] demanded repeal of anticommunist legislation. It should also be noted that some former British [[POW]]'s erected a monument expressing gratitude to the citizens of [[Ubon Ratchathani]]. In the postwar period, Thailand had close relations with the United States, which it saw as a protector from communist revolutions in neighboring countries. See [[United States Air Force in Thailand]].

[[Communist Party of Thailand|Communist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s existed in the country from early '60s up to 1987, counting almost 12,000 full-time fighters at the peak of movement, but never posed a serious threat to the state.

Recently, Thailand also has been an active member in the regional [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), especially after democratic rule was restored in 1992.

==Democracy==
{{main|History of Thailand since 1973}}
{{main|2008–2010 Thai political crisis}}

Post-1973 has been marked by a struggle to define the political contours of the state. It was won by the King and General [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], who favored a monarchy constitutional order.

The post-1973 years have seen a difficult and sometimes bloody transition from military to civilian rule, with several reversals along the way. The revolution of 1973 inaugurated a brief, unstable period of [[democracy]], with [[Military junta|military rule]] being reimposed after the [[6 October 1976 Massacre]]. For most of the 1980s, Thailand was ruled by [[Prem Tinsulanonda]], a democratically inclined strongman who restored parliamentary politics. Thereafter the country remained a democracy apart from a brief period of military rule from 1991 to 1992. The populist [[Thai Rak Thai]] party, led by [[Prime Minister of Thailand|prime minister]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], came to power in 2001. He was popular with the urban, sububan and rural poor for his populist social programs, his rule came under attack from the elite who saw danger in his parliamentary dictatorship. Also in mid-2005, [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a well-known media tycoon, became the foremost Thaksin critic. Eventually Sondhi and his allies developed the movement into a mass protest and later unified under the name of [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD).

On September 19, 2006, after the dissolution of the parliament, Thaksin then became head of a provisional government. While he was in [[New York]] for a meeting of the [[UN]], Army Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]] launched the bloodless [[September 2006 Thailand military coup d'état]] supported by anti-Thaksin elements in civil society and among the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]. A general election on 23 December 2007 restored a civilian government, led by [[Samak Sundaravej]] of the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]], as a successor to Thai Rak Thai.

In mid-2008, the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) led large protests against the government of Prime Minister [[Samak Sundaravej]], whom they criticized for his ties to former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. On 26 August 2008, the protesters illegally occupied several government ministries, including the Government House which they sacked, to force the government to give in to demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7581565.stm |title=Thai protesters 'want new coup' |accessdate=2008-09-02 |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning August 29, protesters disrupted air and rail infrastructure, including [[Suvarnabhumi airport]]. They have never been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hG71oGl1LokvZphtDQZzL44nzc3QD92SI9D00|title=Pressure grows on Thai prime minister to resign|accessdate=2008-09-02|last=Wannabovorn|first=Sutin|publisher=Associated Press|date=2008-08-30}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaos ended in December when three of the parties that formed the government were dissolved by the Constitutional Court for election fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2dec&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ousting the prime minister |curly=y |url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12716260&amp;fsrc=rss |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this decision, many previous coalition partners of the government then defected and joined the main opposition party, the Democrat party, and refusing elections to immediately form a new government in the favour of the old guard elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6548448.html |title=Thailand's Democrat Party, former coalition parties to form new gov't |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 3, 2011, opposition [[Pheu Thai Party]] won general elections in a landslide.
