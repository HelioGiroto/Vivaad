&lt;!-- NOTE: 
WP US history articles are not subdivided by decade, century, or any other arbitrary time period.  They are divided by major turns of historical events.  Look at the existing article to see this.  Several times now, an editor has tried to divide this article into two, breaking on the year 2000.  Nothing special happened in the US in 2000 to justify this division.  As the result, these 2000 division attempts have been reverted.
--&gt;
The '''history of the United States from 1991 to present''' began after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] which signaled the end of the [[Cold War]] and led to the United States' heightened military involvement in the [[Middle East]]. The U.S. expelled an [[Iraq]]i invasion force from [[Kuwait]], a Middle Eastern ally of the U.S., in the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Trailing the [[early 1990s recession]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] returned to the [[White House]] with the election of [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992. In the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 midterm election]] the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] gained control of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first time in 40 years. Strife between Clinton and the Republicans in Congress initially resulted in a [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|federal government shutdown]] following a [[budget crisis]], but later they worked together to pass [[welfare reform]], the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|Children's Health Insurance Program]], and a balanced budget. Charges from the [[Lewinsky scandal]] led to the 1998 [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment of Clinton]] by the House of Representatives but he was later acquitted by the Senate. The U.S. economy boomed in the enthusiasm for high-technology industries in the 1990s until the [[NASDAQ]] crashed as the [[dot-com bubble]] burst and the [[early 2000s recession]] marked the end of the sustained economic growth.

In [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], Republican [[George W. Bush]] was elected president in one of the closest and most controversial elections in U.S. history. Early in his term, his administration approved [[No Child Left Behind Act|education reform]] and a large [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|across-the-board tax cut]] aimed at stimulating the economy. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the U.S. embarked on the [[War on Terror]], starting with the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. In 2003, the U.S. [[Iraq War|invaded Iraq]], which deposed the controversial regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] but also resulted in a prolonged conflict that would continue over the course of the decade. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security Department]] was formed and the controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] was passed to bolster domestic efforts against terrorism. In 2006, criticism over the handling of the disastrous [[Hurricane Katrina]] (which struck the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast region]] in 2005), political scandals, and the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War helped the Democrats [[United States elections, 2006|gain control of Congress]]. In 2007, President Bush ordered a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]] in Iraq, which ultimately led to reduced casualties. The collapse of the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]], which led into the [[late-2000s recession]], helped the Democrats gain the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidency in 2008]] with the election of [[Barack Obama]]. The government enacted large loans and [[national fiscal policy response to the late 2000s recession#United States|economic stimulus packages]] aimed at improving the economy. Obama's domestic initiatives also included the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which made large reforms to the American healthcare system. President Obama eventually withdrew combat troops from Iraq, and shifted the country's efforts in the War on Terror to Afghanistan, where a troop surge was initiated there in 2009. In 2010, due to continued public discontent with the economic situation, unemployment, and federal spending, [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate elections, 2010|reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate]]. In 2011, Obama announced that [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] was killed by U.S. forces during a covert operation in Pakistan. The [[Iraq War]] was declared formally over in 2011.

==Globalization and the new economy==
Clinton's terms in office will be remembered for the nation's domestic focus during this period. The six years span of 1994 through 2000 witnessed the emergence of what many commentators called a technology-driven &quot;[[new economy]]&quot;, and relatively high increases in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below five percent. The [[Internet]] and related technologies made their first broad penetrations into the economy, prompting a [[Wall Street]] technology-driven [[bubble (economics)|bubble]], which [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] described in 1996 as &quot;[[irrational exuberance]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenspan 96&quot;&gt;{{cite speech |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1996/19961205.htm |title=The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society |last=Greenspan |first=Alan |date=December 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the United States was the world's dominant military power and [[Japan]], sometimes seen as the largest economic rival to the U.S., was caught in a period of stagnation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} [[People's Republic of China|China]] was emerging as the U.S.'s foremost trading competitor in more and more areas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Localized conflicts such as those in [[Haiti]] and the [[Balkans]] prompted President [[Bill Clinton]] to send in U.S. troops as [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]], reviving the [[Cold War|Cold-War]]-era controversy about whether policing the rest of the world was a proper U.S. role. [[Islamist terrorism|Islamic radicals]] overseas loudly threatened assaults against the U.S. for its ongoing military presence in the Middle East, and even staged the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|first World Trade Center attack]], a truck bombing in New York's twin towers, in 1993, as well as a number of deadly attacks on U.S. interests abroad.

Immigration, most of it from [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]], swelled during the 1990s, laying the groundwork for great changes in the demographic makeup of the U.S. population in coming decades, such as [[Hispanic]]s replacing [[African-American]]s as the largest minority.  Despite tougher border scrutiny after the [[September 11 attacks]], nearly 8 million [[immigration to the United States|immigrants came to the United States]] from 2000 to 2005—more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-12-12-immigration_x.htm Study: Immigration grows, reaching record numbers]&quot;. USATODAY.com.

Washington Times. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dot-com bubble===
{{main|Dot-com bubble}}
Early 2000 to 2001 saw the dramatic bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]. Excitement over the prospects of Internet stocks had led to huge increases in the major indexes. On March 10, 2000 the [[NASDAQ]] peaked at 5,048.62,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2000/03/10/2000-03-10_nasdaq_hits_the_big_time___s.html |title=NASDAQ hits the big time stock record lights up times square |last=Dillon |first=Nancy |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=March 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than double its value just a year before.  The downturn began on March 13, 2000, triggering a chain reaction of selling that fed on itself as investors, funds, and institutions liquidated positions. In just six days, the NASDAQ had lost nearly nine percent, falling to 4,580 on March 15.  By 2001, the bubble was deflating at full speed. A majority of the dot-coms ceased trading after burning through their [[venture capital]], many having never made a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. Duane Ireland|author2=Robert E.

==Conflicts==

===First Iraq War===
{{main|Gulf War}}
[[File:Gypsy escortDN-ST-91-05966.jpg|left|thumb|200px|U.S. military aircraft flying over Iraq during the Gulf War]]
The considerable dependence of the industrialized world on oil, with much of the proved oil reserves situated in Middle Eastern countries, became evident to the U.S., first in the aftermath of the [[1973 energy crisis|1973 world oil shock]] and later in the [[1979 energy crisis|second energy crisis of 1979]]. Although in real terms oil prices fell back to pre-1973 levels through the 1980s, resulting in a windfall for the oil-consuming nations (especially North America, Western Europe, and Japan), the vast reserves of the leading Middle East producers guaranteed the region its strategic importance. By the early 1990s the politics of oil still proved as hazardous as it did in the early 1970s.

Conflict in the Middle East triggered yet another international crisis on August 2, 1990, when [[Iraq]] invaded and attempted to annex neighboring [[Kuwait]]. U.S. officials feared that Hussein was then on the verge of armed conflict with oil-rich [[Saudi Arabia]], a close ally of Washington's since the 1940s. The United Nations condemned the invasion as an act of aggression; Bush compared Hussein to [[Adolf Hitler]] and declared that if the United States and international community did not act, aggression would be encouraged elsewhere in the world. The Security Council gave Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait, but Saddam Hussein ignored it, and the Security Council authorized a military response. The war began in January 1991, with U.S. troops forming the majority of the coalition which participated in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. By the time Iraqi troops withdrew from Kuwait in late February, Iraq had lost approximately 20,000 troops, with some sources citing as many as 100,000 casualties on the Iraqi side.

===Conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Middle East===
[[File:Black Hawk Down Super64 over Mogadishu coast.jpg|thumb|right|An American helicopter flies over the Somalian coast during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]], part of U.S. involvement in Somalia in the early 1990s.]] 

In December 1992, President Bush sent troops to join the UN [[Operation Restore Hope]], a multi-national effort to restore order and provide humanitarian aid in [[Somalia]], which was torn by civil war, famine, and warlords. By the summer of 1993, the situation had deteriorated. After 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in June 1993, the UN passed a resolution calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for the attack. Under the leadership of newly-elected President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. forces launched a concentrated attack on Aidid's stronghold in [[Mogadishu]] in [[Operation Gothic Serpent]]. In October 1993, 19 soldiers were killed and 84 were wounded in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]. After the attack, Clinton ordered U.S. forces withdrawn from the region, with the last being withdrawn by 1995, and fired his Secretary of Defense [[Les Aspin]] who had not sent adequate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Anne Warshaw, ''The Clinton years'' (2004) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1990s, the United States was involved in the [[Bosnian War]] through the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), most notably the [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1995 bombing campaign]], which finally led to the [[Dayton Peace Agreement|Dayton Agreement]] which ended the war by the end of 1995. In late 1998, the region became volatile again as war erupted between the army of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]], a guerrilla group. A [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|1999 NATO bombing campaign]] struck Yugoslavia, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Yugoslavian soldiers and civilians. As a result, Yugoslavia withdrew from [[Kosovo]] and Kosovo became an independent state.&lt;ref&gt;Derek H. Chollet, ''The road to the Dayton accords: a study of American statecraft'' (2005) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

President Clinton also presided over [[cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1996)|cruise missile strikes on Iraq in 1996]] and [[bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|bombing attacks on Iraq in 1998]], which were launched in response to Saddam Hussein's violation of several UN resolutions, including repression of ethnic minorities ([[Kurdish people|Kurds]]) and removing UN weapons inspectors. The 1998 campaign, in particular, was meant to de-stabilize the Iraqi government and degrade the power of Hussein. Clinton also signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] to appropriate funds to Iraqi opposition groups in the hopes of overthrowing Hussein's regime and establishing democracy.

Throughout the 1990s, the United States also played an active role in [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|peace efforts]] in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. President Clinton, [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], and [[Palestine|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Yasser Arafat]] met and the [[Oslo Accords]] were signed in 1993, which called for the gradual ceding of control of Palestinian areas to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. However, Rabin was assassinated in 1995 and by 2000, the [[Camp David 2000 Summit|Camp David Summit]] failed to yield a new agreement when Arafat rejected new Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s 95% offer, which would give Palestine control of 95% of their territories with the condition that refugees that had fled Palestine since 1948 cannot return. Arafat never made a counter-offer. In the 2000s (decade), under the leadership of President [[George W. Bush]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]], and Palestinian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud Abbas]], peace talk efforts continued with the new &quot;[[road map for peace]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Yasir Arafat: A Political Biography'' (2005) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early al-Qaeda attacks===
1993 began a series of increasingly high-profile attacks associated with [[al-Qaeda]], a radical Muslim militant organization led by [[Osama bin Laden]]. On February 26, 1993, [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|a truck bomb was detonated]] at the World Trade Center in [[New York City]], killing 6 and injuring over 1000. The attack was intended to destroy the foundation of the North Tower, knocking the tower into the South Tower, which would destroy both buildings and kill thousands of people. While this did not happen, the bomb caused considerable damage to the lower levels of the North Tower. In 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the bombing and in 1997, two men were convicted for their roles, including the truck driver and the mastermind, [[Ramzi Yousef]].

On June 25, 1996, al-Qaeda terrorists [[Khobar Towers bombing|bombed the Khobar Towers]], a complex in [[Saudi Arabia]] where members of the U.S. military were being housed, killing 19 American servicemen and injuring over 300.

Al-Qaeda [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombed the U.S. Embassy in Kenya]] on August 7, 1998, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. The U.S. launched cruise missile strikes on a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, yet this failed to destroy al-Qaeda's vast network. In October 2000, al-Qaeda militants [[USS Cole bombing|bombed the USS ''Cole'']] off the coast of [[Yemen]], killing 17 servicemen and severely damaging the ship.&lt;ref&gt;John Callaway, &quot;Learning the Hard Way,&quot; ''Naval War College Review,'' Winter 2009, Vol. 62 Issue 1, pp 107-122 covers the 1983 Beirut, Lebanon bombings, the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2001 attacks===
{{main|September 11 attacks}}

[[File:Bush Ground Zero.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush addresses rescue workers at [[Ground Zero]] in [[New York]], September 14, 2001: &quot;I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.&quot;]]
On the morning of September 11, 2001, four airliners were hijacked; two of them were flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and another into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], destroying both towers and taking just under 3,000 lives. The fourth plane crashed in southern [[Pennsylvania]] after some passengers fought back and are believed to have caused the piloting hijackers to crash. The immense shock, grief and anger brought on by the attacks profoundly altered the national mood; it was found that Osama bin Laden and his [[al-Qaeda]] militant network of Islamist insurgents sponsored the attacks and President Bush announced a &quot;[[war on terror]]&quot;.

Congress approved several measures to protect against future attacks, including creating the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and passing the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which was criticized by groups such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. The administration's military response was to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invade Afghanistan]] on October 7, 2001, targeting al-Qaeda and the [[Taliban]] government that supported and sheltered them. The U.S. was joined by a coalition which included forces from more than a dozen countries, and was successful in removing the Taliban from power, although fighting continues between the coalition and Afghans of various factions.

In 2002, the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] growth rate rose to 2.8%. A major short-term problem in the first half of 2002 was a sharp decline in the [[stock market]], fueled in part by the exposure of [[accounting scandals of 2002|dubious accounting practices in some major corporations]]. Another was unemployment, which experienced the longest period of monthly increase since the [[Great Depression]]. The United States began to recover from the post-9/11 recession in 2003, but the robustness of the market (7% GDP growth), combined with the unemployment rate (above 6%), led some economists and politicians to refer to the situation as a &quot;[[jobless recovery]]&quot;. However, the unemployment rate fell in subsequent years (falling below 5% in 2006), while GDP growth continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unemployment&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat1.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Iraq War===
{{main|Iraq War}}
[[File:UStanks baghdad 2003.JPEG|thumb|right|M1A1 Abrams pose for a photo under the &quot;Hands of Victory&quot; in Ceremony Square, [[Baghdad, Iraq]].]]

In his [[2002 State of the Union Address|State of the Union address]] in January 2002, President George W. Bush called [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[North Korea]] an &quot;[[axis of evil]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html |title=State of the Union address |last=Bush |first=George W. |date=January 29, 2002 |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration later began making a public case for an invasion of Iraq, accusing them of violating the 1991 UN-imposed [[ceasefire]], supporting terrorism and being in possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]] (later, the latter of these accusations were proved to be false, and the first two are considered very dubious by most historians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021002-2.html |title=Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq |date=October 2, 2002 |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important allies of the U.S., including [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Turkey]], [[New Zealand]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Canada]], did not believe that the evidence for the President's accusations was well-founded enough to justify a full-scale invasion, especially as military personnel were still needed in Afghanistan. The UN Security Council did not approve of the invasion, and the U.S. therefore provided most of the forces in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. With the support of a coalition whose major partners included the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]], Iraq was invaded on March 20, 2003.

[[File:OIF fatalities by month.png|thumb|left|A graph of U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq. The orange months are post-[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]] and the blue months are under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].]]

After six weeks of combat between the coalition and the Iraqi army, the invading forces had secured control of many key regions; Hussein had fled his palace, his regime clearly over; on May 1, Bush declared, under a sign reading &quot;[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|mission accomplished]]&quot;, that major ground operations were at an end. Saddam Hussein's sons [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]] and [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] were killed by U.S. forces; Saddam himself was captured in December 2003 and taken into custody. Nevertheless, fighting with the [[Iraqi insurgency]] continued and escalated through the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. national elections]] and beyond.

With [[Invasion and occupation of Iraq casualties|casualties]] increasing and the cost of the invasion and reconstruction of Iraq estimated at over $200 billion, the war has lost about one-third of its supporters in the U.S. since the end of major operations was announced. Contemporary polls suggested that international displeasure with the United States was at an all-time high, with a majority of people in Europe believing that the country was too powerful and acted mainly in self-interest, and a vast majority in predominantly Muslim nations believing that the United States was arrogant, belligerent, or hateful to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=46 |title=International Surveys: What We Are Finding |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=April 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the situation in Iraq became increasingly difficult, policymakers began looking for new options. This led to the formation of the [[Iraq Study Group]], a nonpartisan commission chaired by [[James Baker]] and [[Lee H. Hamilton]]. This produced a variety of proposals; some of the more notable ones were to seek decreased US presence in Iraq, increased engagement with neighboring countries, and greater attention to resolving other local conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The recommendations were generally ignored, and instead, Bush ordered a surge of troops to Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Violence in the country declined in 2008 and 2009, and the U.S. combat role ended in August 2010. U.S. forces were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war was declared formally over in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/world/middleeast/panetta-in-baghdad-for-iraq-military-handover-ceremony.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Thom | last1=Shanker | first2=Michael S. | last2=Schmidt | first3=Robert F. | last3=Worth | title=In Baghdad, Panetta Leads Uneasy Closure to Conflict | date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic terrorism==
[[File:Oklahomacitybombing-DF-ST-98-01356.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing]]
The 1990s and 2000s (decade) became known for several incidents of domestic terrorism, usually perpetrated by those dissatisfied with actions of the federal government, big business, or other aspects of American society.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a mysterious man known in the media as the &quot;Unabomber&quot; sent [[mail bomb]]s to figures in the academic and airline industries for various reasons. After a lull, he began another mail bombing campaign in earnest, beginning in 1993. His targets expanded to include big businesses such as representatives of the timber and oil industries. Two people were killed in the mid 1990s and an exhaustive and expensive investigation by the FBI coupled with intense national media interest in the story resulted in the identification and arrest of the perpetrator [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who was sentenced to life in prison.

On April 19, 1995, a [[truck bomb]] [[Oklahoma City bombing|was detonated]] outside the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], killing 168 people and injuring over 600. The bombing became the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in the United States and led to sweeping reforms in [[United States federal building security]]. The attack's perpetrator, [[Timothy McVeigh]], was an anti-government extremist who used the [[Waco Siege]] and [[Ruby Ridge]] incidents as justification for his retaliation against the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, ''American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; While McVeigh wanted to specifically target federal agents, the bombing killed many innocent civilians, including 19 children. McVeigh was executed in 2001 and his accomplice [[Terry Nichols]] was sentenced to life in prison.

In July 1996, in the midst of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] at [[Centennial Olympic Park]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|a homemade bomb was detonated]], resulting in the deaths of 2 people and injuring over 100. This was followed by similar attacks at two [[abortion clinic]]s and a lesbian nightclub. In 2003, suspect [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] was arrested and sentenced in 2005 to five life sentences for these attacks.

In 2001, only days after the [[September 11 attacks]], letters laced with [[anthrax]] [[2001 Anthrax attacks|were sent to several individuals]], including prominent news personalities and government officials. The letters killed 5 people and infected a further 17. This incident of [[bioterrorism]] was initially blamed on international terrorist organization al-Qaeda, but in 2008, was determined to stem from a Maryland scientist by the name of [[Bruce Edward Ivins]], who committed suicide before he could be prosecuted.

==Crime and violence==
[[File:NIU crosses flowers.JPG|left|thumb|A makeshift memorial in tribute to the victims of the Northern Illinois University shooting, one of many school shootings that afflicted the United States.]]

In the early 1990s, the U.S. violent crime rate reached its peak before a steady decline began around 1993. Nevertheless, the ongoing drug problem (involving sales of marijuana and cocaine) continued to be a major factor in [[crime in the United States]]. The overall rate of major crimes fell during the period. In 2009, the FBI estimated 1,318,000 violent crimes occurred nationwide, which was 7.5% below the 2000 level of 1,425,000 and 31% below the 1991 level of 1,912,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/violent_crime/index.html |title=Violent Crime |publisher=FBI |work=Crime in the United States 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]] occurred after four [[Los Angeles]] police officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]]. The riots occurred primarily in [[South Central Los Angeles]], a predominantly black and Hispanic area. Over 50 people were killed and 2000 were injured. 3,600 fires were set, destroying over 1,000 buildings and widespread looting occurred, especially of businesses owned by the [[Korean American|Korean American community]]. In all, nearly $1 billion in damage was caused.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Abelmann and John Lie, ''Blue dreams: Korean Americans and the Los Angeles riots'' (1997){{page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), a surge of hate crimes against the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] community occurred in the United States. The most publicized incident was the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]] in Wyoming after two young men kidnapped, tortured, and murdered him in 1998. In 2009, Congress passed the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] which extended the hate crime law to women, the disabled, and gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals.

A spate of [[school shooting]]s rocked the country in the late 1990s and 2000s (decade), the deadliest of which were the [[Westside Middle School massacre]] (1998), the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (1999), the [[Red Lake High School massacre]] (2005), the [[Amish school shooting]] (2006), the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] (2007), and the [[Northern Illinois University shooting]] (2008). These shootings added fuel to the fire for the debates over [[gun politics]] and [[media violence]], and led to increased focus on mental health, school safety, and anti-bullying.

The [[Washington Metropolitan Area|Capital Region]] was struck by the [[Beltway sniper attacks]], a series of sniper attacks on civilians and federal workers by two gunmen over a month-long period in October 2002. The attackers killed 10 people and injured three. Two men were arrested and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Angie Cannon, ''23 Days of Terror: The Compelling True Story of the Hunt and Capture of the Beltway Snipers'' (2003){{page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, U.S. Army major [[Nidal Malik Hasan]] killed 13 fellow servicemen and injured 30 in the [[Fort Hood shooting]] in [[Killeen, Texas]]. While the act was called terrorism by some due to Hasan's Muslim heritage, the attack was ruled out by the FBI to have been perpetrated by a terrorist organization. On January 8, 2011, U.S. Representative [[Gabrielle Giffords]] was the target of an assassination attempt, when [[2011 Tucson shooting|a gunman went on a shooting spree]], critically injuring Giffords, killing federal judge [[John Roll]] and five other people, and wounding at least 14 others.

In July 2012, [[2012 Aurora shooting|a man shot 70 people]] (the highest number of victims of any mass shooting in American history) at a movie theater in [[Aurora, Colorado]], killing twelve and injuring 58 people.

==Disasters==

===Natural disasters===
On August 24, 1992, the category-five [[Hurricane Andrew]] made landfall in [[South Florida]], devastating the southern suburbs of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], including [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], and [[Cutler Ridge, Florida|Cutler Ridge]]. Two days later, the storm made landfall again in a sparsely populated part of [[Louisiana]], with relatively less damage than in Florida. The storm killed 26 people directly, 39 indirectly. With $26 billion in damage, it became the costliest storm in history at that time. The storm was known for many controversies including the sluggish federal response, which may have impacted President George H.W. Bush's image on domestic issues, as well as poor housing construction which may have led to such high levels of destruction.

[[File:Storm of the century satellite.gif|thumb|right|200 pix|Satellite image of the &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;]]
In March 1993, a massive storm, known as the &quot;[[1993 Storm of the Century|Storm of the Century]]&quot; or &quot;Superstorm&quot; struck the [[Eastern Seaboard]] of the United States. The storm set low pressure records; produced hurricane-force winds, storm surge, and killer tornadoes in Florida; and produced snowfall up to {{convert|2|ft|cm}} across many portions of the Eastern United States. The storm was particularly crippling to the Southern United States, where places like [[Birmingham, Alabama]] received one-and-a-half feet of snow and record low temperatures, highly unusual for the region. In all, 300 deaths were attributed to the storm and $6 billion in damage was caused.

The [[Great Flood of 1993]] affected the [[Midwestern United States]] in the spring and summer of that year, devastating large portions of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Missouri River]] Valleys and their tributaries. Many small towns were devastated and agricultural losses were significant. 10,000 homes were destroyed and {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of agricultural lands were inundated. 50 people perished in the floods and $15 billion in damage was done.

In the early morning hours of January 17, 1994, the [[San Fernando Valley]] region of Los Angeles was hit by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake, known as the &quot;[[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]]&quot;. The quake killed more than 70 people and injured 9,000. Most of the fatalities were attributed to collapsed buildings, parking structures, or freeways. Striking an urban area, it was very destructive, causing $20 billion in damage.

In July 1995, the city of [[Chicago]] was hit by [[1995 Chicago heat wave|a heat wave]] that had severe repercussions. During a five-day spell from July 12 to July 16, the high temperature hovered from the mid 90s to the mid 100s. The heat index pushed 120 degrees on many days. The heat wave resulted in the deaths of over 700 people, many of whom were black, elderly, or poor. The event brought increased attention to these segments of the population and the importance of reaching out to them during heat waves, as well as the concept of the [[urban heat island]] effect, in which urban environments exacerbate heat and humidity levels. Additionally, power failures and lack of adequate warning and general preparedness aggravated the situation and may have contributed to such high fatalities.

In January 1996, the [[North American blizzard of 1996|Blizzard of 1996]] affected the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic United States]], dumping up to {{convert|36|in|cm}} of snow on many areas, crippling major American cities like [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], New York City, and [[Boston]]. The storm killed 150 people and caused $3 billion in damages.

On May 3, 1999, [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|a violent tornado outbreak]] struck the Southern [[Great Plains]], predominantly [[Oklahoma]]. The most destructive tornado was an F5 tornado that struck Oklahoma City and the suburb of [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]]. The tornado is one of the most prominent examples of a tornado striking a major urban area and became the first tornado to incur over $1 billion in damages. In all, the outbreak resulted in 50 deaths and over 600 injuries.

In 2004, four hurricanes--[[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]], and [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]]—struck the state of Florida in a one-month timespan, resulting in over 100 U.S. deaths and nearly $50 billion in damage combined. Out of the four hurricanes, Ivan was the deadliest in the U.S., while Charley was the most destructive.

[[File:Hurricane Katrina Flooding.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Flooding due to Hurricane Katrina]]
2005 brought [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history]]. In August 2005, the powerful [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] region. Katrina broke the [[levees]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and flooded 80% of the low-lying city. Extensive devastation and flooding also occurred from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]] west to [[Beaumont, Texas]], with the [[Mississippi]] coastline especially hard hit. At least 1,800 lives were lost in the worst domestic calamity since the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]]. Port facilities, oil rigs and refineries in the Gulf region were damaged, further increasing already high U.S. fuel prices. Residents of New Orleans, many of whom were impoverished and unable (or unwilling) to evacuate before the storm, were trapped for days by the flood waters. Tens of thousands had to be rescued by the U.S. military from their rooftops or from unsanitary and dangerous shelters in public buildings. State and local authorities were overwhelmed by the scale of the events. Their response to the disaster, as well the federal government's, were harshly criticized by legislators and citizens who saw in the confusion a dangerous lack of readiness and inability to preserve public safety. President Bush promised that the federal government would underwrite the rebuilding of New Orleans and other storm-damaged areas, the cost of which was estimated to run as high as $200 billion. Only weeks after Katrina, [[Hurricane Rita]] struck the Texas/Louisiana border in September. Rita caused the largest evacuation in U.S. history, as millions of people fled the Houston area, as well as portions of Louisiana. Rita resulted in over 100 fatalities, the vast majority of which were indirect, occurring during the evacuation or in the aftermath of the storm. Additionally, $10 billion in damage was attributed to Rita. Later in the season, [[Hurricane Wilma]] struck the state of Florida in October 2005, killing 35 people and doing $20 billion worth of damage. The storm yielded the lowest pressure value ever recorded in history before making landfall in Florida, making it the most intense storm on record.

On [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]] in February 2008, in the midst of heated primary elections in multiple states, [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak|a destructive tornado outbreak]] hit the [[Mid-South]] region, spawning dangerous nighttime twisters across the region. A total of 87 tornadoes were reported. Over 60 people were killed across [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Arkansas]], and Alabama and hundreds were injured. Losses exceeded $1 billion. The outbreak was the deadliest outbreak in the U.S. in 23 years, and brought renewed attention to the dangers of nighttime tornadoes, winter tornadoes, and the vulnerability of populations in the Southern United States.

In September 2008, after two straight years of not being affected by a serious hurricane, [[Hurricane Gustav]] caused $18 billion in damage in Louisiana, and a few weeks later, the [[Galveston, Texas]] and [[Houston, Texas]] areas were devastated by [[Hurricane Ike]] with over $31 billion in damage, making Ike the third most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United States behind Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina. Over 100 people were killed. The hurricanes also caused gas prices to spike to around $4 per gallon.

In the spring of 2011, several major tornado outbreaks affected the [[Central United States|Central]] and [[Southern United States]]. 43 people were killed in [[April 14–16, 2011 tornado outbreak|a tornado outbreak from April 14–16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gargis|first=Peggy|coauthors=Harriet McLeod|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2011-04-16|accessdate=2011-04-16|title=Tornadoes, storms kill at least 17 in South|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/16/us-weather-tornadoes-idUSTRE73F22I20110416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPC16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for April 16, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110416_rpts.html|publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|date=2011-04-17|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 350+ people were killed in [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak|a tornado outbreak from April 25 - April 28]], the deadliest U.S. tornado outbreak in 75 years (since the 1936 [[Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;France 24&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Tornado outbreak is second deadliest in US history|url=http://www.france24.com/en/201104340-usa-tornadoes-storm-second-deadliest-US-history-alabama|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1932outbreak&gt;{{cite news|last=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/04/29/severe.weather/index.html?hpt=T2/|title=Rescue efforts transition to recovery in hard-hit Alabama|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=13495182|title=Death Toll From Tornadoes Rises to 329|publisher =ABC|date=2011-04-30|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vilonia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011|title=Heavy Rain/Severe Weather on April 23–27, 2011|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lzk/?n=hydro0411.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; States particularly hit hard by the outbreaks included Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and most especially, Alabama, which sustained over 250 fatalities alone.

In August 2011, [[Hurricane Irene]] was the first hurricane to make landfall since Ike in 2008, striking the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, making landfalls in North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York. The storm killed at least 45 people and caused $10 billion in damage. The storm was particularly notable for its extensive flooding in the Northeast, and a couple days later, [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] made landfall in Louisiana, its remnants tracking to the Northeast for even more devastating floods.

In October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] struck the East Coast of the United States, making landfall near [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The storm knocked out power to millions of people and caused flooding in parts of [[New York City]] along with devastation to the [[Jersey Shore]] and portions of [[Long Island]] and [[Staten Island]]. The storm has been blamed for more than 100 fatalities and is estimated to have caused at least $50 billion in damage.

===Other disasters===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil rig burns after exploding in April 2010. The disaster led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.]]
Notable aviation disasters in the 1990s included [[TWA Flight 800]] crashing off the coast of [[Long Island]], en route to [[Paris, France]], on July 17, 1996 due to an explosion of the fuel tank, killing 230 and [[EgyptAir Flight 990]] crashing south of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], en route to [[Cairo, Egypt]], on October 31, 1999 due to deliberate crashing by the first officer, killing 217. Shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the second-deadliest U.S. aviation incident occurred when [[American Airlines Flight 587]] crashed in [[Queens, New York]], en route to the [[Dominican Republic]], on November 12, 2001 due to overuse of rudder controls by the pilot to counteract turbulence, killing 265 (including 5 on the ground).

On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disintegrated upon re-entry to the Earth over parts of Texas and Louisiana during [[STS-107]], resulting in the deaths of all seven astronauts. The incident resulted from a piece of foam insulation that fell off during launch, which struck the shuttle, creating a hole that allowed hot gases to penetrate the shuttle during re-entry. In the aftermath of the disaster, the [[space shuttle program]] was suspended for 29 months as [[NASA]] investigated the incident and made plans to prevent future tragedies.

On February 17, 2003, [[2003 E2 nightclub stampede|a stampede occurred at the E2 nightclub]] in Chicago, after an incident involving pepper spray, resulting in the deaths of 21 people. Three days later, on February 20, 100 people perished and over 200 were injured in [[The Station nightclub fire]] in [[West Warwick, Rhode Island]], when pyrotechnics ignited flammable sound-proofing during a performance by the band [[Great White]]. Both incidents brought attention to the need to crack down on building, fire, and safety code violations to prevent future tragedies. [[2003 Chicago balcony collapse|A porch collapse]] that killed 13 and seriously injured 57 in June 2003 in Chicago further emphasized the problems with building code violations in the United States.

On August 1, 2007, the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge#Collapse|collapsed]] into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people and injuring over 50. The bridge was under construction at the time. The incident brought to attention the need to inspect and rehabilitate the aging infrastructure system in the United States.

On April 20, 2010, an [[off shore oil drilling]] rig, the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'', [[Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion|exploded and burned]] off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats and helicopters, however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the incident. The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking. On April 24, it was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate. For approximately 90 days, tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day, resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. The wellhead was successfully contained in mid-July, stopping the flow, and efforts are ongoing to cap the wellhead and create a replacement well. Despite significant efforts to protect coastlines, the spill has had devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf Coast states. The Obama administration has ordered rig owner [[British Petroleum|BP]] responsible for all cleanup costs, which are expected to run in the tens of billions of dollars. The spill has resulted in negative public approval ratings of the U.S. government, the Obama administration, and BP, for their handling of the spill, with BP suffering the worst ratings.

==Energy issues==
[[File:Energy-usa-1980+.jpg|thumb|300px|US energy consumption 1980–2008, with projections to 2035&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/execsummary.html |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2010 with Projections to 2035 |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After 1970 the U.S. began importing oil, as consumption kept rising and the nation's oil fields became less productive.  Throughout the 1990s the world price of crude oil range between $10 and $40, and the average price at the pump did not exceed $1.40.  Oil prices tripled after 2002, peaking at $147 in July 2008, about $4 dollars a gallon; the price has continued to fluctuate widely.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Downey, ''Oil 101'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of &quot;[[United States energy independence|energy independence]]&quot; led to legislation mandating more fuel efficient autos—even electric vehicles—and more efficient use of energy, ranging from insulation to new light bulbs. Even worse than the high price, was the fear of shortages.  Many proposals and pilot projects for replacement energy sources, from [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] to [[wind power]] and [[solar power]] were discussed and, indeed, funded by Congress after 2000.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Graham, ''Bush on the Home Front: Domestic Policy Triumphs and Setbacks'' (Indiana UP, 2010, pp 115-93&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|economic stimulus package]] signed by President Obama in early 2009, billions of dollars were allocated for [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Energy efficiency and renewable energy research and investment|research and development of new energy sources]].

While public attention focused on supplies from the Middle East, the main source was actually Canada.  After 2007, new methods of extraction opened up vast new deposits of oil in the [[Bakken Formation]] in North Dakota and Montana. As much as two trillion dollars worth of natural gas is potentially available in the [[Marcellus Formation]] deposits located in the historic 19th century oil fields in [[Appalachia]], stretching from West Virginia through Pennsylvania into western New York. However, there is sharp debate underway regarding the environmental impact on the region's fresh water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Considine, &quot;The Economic Impacts of the Marcellus Shale: Implications for New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia,&quot; (2010) [http://www.scribd.com/doc/34656839/The-Economic-Impacts-of-the-Marcellus-Shale-Implications-for-New-York-Pennsylvania-West-Virginia online]&lt;/ref&gt; The question of drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) was highly controversial, as Republican proposals were blocked by the Democrats in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Bush on the Home Front'' p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Republicans in 2008 were campaigning for more offshore drilling, with the slogan &quot;[[drill, baby, drill]]&quot;,  but the 2010 Gulf oil spill put all new drilling on hold.

==Politics==

===The Clinton administration===
{{main|Presidency of Bill Clinton}}
{{see also|Timeline of modern American conservatism}}
[[File:Clinton Administration.jpg|thumb|left|President Clinton's First Cabinet, 1993]]
Riding high on the success of the first Gulf War, [[George H. W. Bush]] enjoyed very high approval ratings as president. However, economic recession and a [[no new taxes|reneged campaign pledge]] dogged Bush, sinking his formerly high approval ratings from the high 80s to the lower 40s and upper 30s. In the wake of Bush's political problems, [[Bill Clinton]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 contest]] with 43% of the vote in a three way race against Bush's 38%. Independent candidate [[Ross Perot]] tapped the discontent of the electorate with both parties, drawing roughly evenly from both candidates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF936A35752C1A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: DISAPPOINTMENT -- NEWS ANALYSIS An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be | first=Steven A. | last=Holmes | date=November 5, 1992 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to receive a record 19% of the popular vote, but no electoral votes. Perot's result qualified his [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] to receive [[Federal Election Commission]] matching funds for campaign contributions in the 1996 election, thus laying the groundwork for another three-way race during the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]].

Clinton entered office as one of the youngest presidents in U.S. history and the first of the [[Baby Boom Generation]] to reach the [[White House]]. Promising to focus on and resolve some of the United States' many domestic issues, he entered office with high expectations. Immediately, however, he was hurt when he had to withdraw major nominees (over nonpayment of taxes). Much of his planned activity was overwhelmed by the intense debate over his proposal to permit gays to serve in the military.  The outcome was a new &quot;[[don't ask, don't tell]]&quot; compromise policy and loss of initiative in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Schwartz, ''The 1990s'' (2006) p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

One early domestic victory of the [[Clinton administration]] was the enactment of the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|1994 Assault Weapons Ban]]. The ban was widely decried by the Republicans, who allowed it to lapse in 2004 while they controlled both Congress and the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Federal ban on assault weapons expires | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-09-12-weapons-ban_x.htm |author=Lawrence, Jill |work=USA Today |date=September 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Clinton's [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|proposal of a national health care]] system, championed by his wife [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillary Clinton bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinton, Hillary (1947 -) |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Hillary-Clinton-9251306 |publisher=Biography.com|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignited a political firestorm on the right, which vigorously opposed it on the general principle that government size should be reduced not expanded. The proposed system did not survive the debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillary Clinton bio&quot;/&gt;  However Hillary Clinton did succeed, along with a bipartisan coalition of members of congress, in establishing the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|Children's Health Insurance Program]].

===The Republican Congress===
[[File:NewtGingrich.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, 1995–1999]]
The [[New Deal]], the [[Great Society]], and [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] helped solidify Democratic control of Congress, but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition, when the popularity of Democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with Congress' governing capacities. Democrats suddenly lost control of the House and the Senate for the first time in four decades in the [[U.S. House election, 1994|1994 midterm elections]]. Once in power, House Republicans, led by [[Newt Gingrich]], faced the difficulty of learning to govern after forty years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their &quot;[[Contract with America]]&quot;, which they unveiled on the steps of Congress on September 27, 1994.

Year by year, polarization grew in Washington between the president and his adversaries on the right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} There was a surge in the market of new media outlets that gave more voice to the right. [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s radio talk show was a spectacular success and a major influence in the GOP legislative victory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' was formed in 1995 and after the election of George W. Bush would advertise itself as the most read publication in the White House. These new media amplified the ever-louder quarrels, causing a &quot;[[culture war]]&quot; as rival groups tried to redefine America in their own image.&lt;ref&gt;James Davison Hunter, ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' (1992) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Violent extremists were discredited after the [[Oklahoma City bombing|bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City]], in April 1995, killing 168.&lt;ref&gt;David Hoffman, ''The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror'' (Feral House, 1998), ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with strong backing from traditional Democrats and liberals, Clinton was able to garner the support of moderates{{Who|date=October 2011}} who appreciated his centrist &quot;[[New Democrat]]&quot; policies, which steered away from the expansion of government services of the New Deal and Great Society and allowed him to &quot;[[Triangulation (politics)|triangulate]]&quot;, taking away many of the Republicans' top issues. One example of such compromises was [[welfare reform]] legislation signed into law in 1996. The new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments, but did allow states to exempt 20% of their caseloads from the time limits. Clinton also pursued tough{{Says who|date=October 2011}} federal anti-crime measures, steering more federal dollars toward the [[War on Drugs|war on drugs]], and calling for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers.  Compromise came with difficulty, though, as the parties failed to agree on a budget, causing the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|federal government to shut down]] in late 1995 into early 1996.  By the end of his administration, the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus. The first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the [[Social Security Trust Fund]].

Clinton was [[United States presidential election, 1996|reelected in 1996]], defeating Republican Senator [[Bob Dole]] and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot, who did not repeat the success of his 1992 campaign.

Many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook long-standing rumors of extramarital affairs by Clinton, deeming them irrelevant. These matters came to a head, however, in February 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between Clinton and a White House intern, [[Monica Lewinsky]]. Clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship; &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Clinton |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Clinton |url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19980126-3087.html |title=Remarks by the President at the After-School Program Event |date=1998-01-28 |publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a &quot;[[vast right-wing conspiracy]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary]] (1998-01-27).

In 1999, Republican [[Dennis Hastert]] of Illinois became Speaker of the House, a position he would hold until 2007, making him the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House.

===The George W. Bush administration===
{{main|Presidency of George W. Bush}}
[[File:Bush 43 10-19-04 Stpete.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004.]]
Though his [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] had been the focus of intense controversy which led eventually to a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' where the court ruled 5–4 in the former's favor by siding with the State of Florida's official vote count, George W. Bush was sworn in as President on January 20, 2001. This made the 2000 election the third presidential election in which the electoral vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote. Early in his term, Bush signed a controversial $1.3 trillion federal [[tax cut]] aimed at revitalizing the economy, but also led to federal budget deficits. Other laws enacted in his first term included the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] education reform bill in 2002, the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003 and the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] in 2004. The first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful; however, it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end. The year 2001 was plagued by a [[early 2000s recession|nine-month recession]], witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance, with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures rising.

On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the World Trade Center and [[the Pentagon]] in the [[September 11 attacks]], killing nearly 3,000 and injuring over 6,000 people. Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks. President Bush ordered all flights grounded and U.S. airspace remained closed for the rest of the week. An emergency bailout package for the airline industry was passed, and stocks fell dramatically when markets re-opened the following week. In response to the attacks, the Bush administration and Congress passed the controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]], aimed at enhancing security, and established the [[Department of Homeland Security]], a mass consolidation of many federal agencies charged with investigation, intelligence, and emergency management.  A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources but was discontinued after being revealed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberts Wants Damage Assessment Caused by New York Times Report|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201259,00.html|publisher=Fox News|date=2006-06-27|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. On October 7, 2001, the United States invaded [[Afghanistan]] as part of a global [[War on Terrorism]], aimed at rooting out al-Qaeda, the [[Taliban]], and other terrorist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/ret.attack.pentagon/ |title=Defense officials: Air operation to last 'several days' |publisher=CNN |date=October 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Bush launched the [[War in Iraq]] on March 20, 2003, under controversial grounds that Saddam Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction. Bush announced on May 1, 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in Iraq were completed, with a &quot;[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]&quot; banner serving as a backdrop. However, support for the invasion declined as a [[guerilla war]] led by the [[Iraqi insurgency]] would continue for the remainder of the decade, resulting in the deaths of over 4,000 U.S. troops, and it was later shown that Iraq never possessed weapons of mass destruction as the Bush administration claimed. Late in 2003, Hussein was captured, and was subsequently put to trial before the Iraqi people and executed in 2006.

Meanwhile, the economy recovered from the early 2000s economic recession, with GDP growth rising to 7% in the middle of 2003, with continued growth through the mid 2000s. The unemployment rate peaked at 6% in 2003, before falling in 2004 and 2005, and dropping below 5% in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unemployment&quot;/&gt;

George W. Bush was [[United States presidential election, 2004|re-elected in November 2004]], defeating Democratic contender [[John Kerry]] in the [[electoral college|electoral vote]], and receiving 50.7% of the popular vote against John Kerry's 48.3%. Republicans also made gains in both houses of Congress. 

Some major acts in Bush's second term included the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users|Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act]], and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]. After seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|title=Bush Job Approval at 28%, Lowest of His Administration|accessdate=January 20, 2009|date=April 11, 2008|publisher=Gallup Poll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/16/opinion/polls/main4728399.shtml|title=Bush's Final Approval Rating: 22 Percent|accessdate=209–01–29|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term, due to his handling of the prolonged [[Iraq war]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[2008 financial crisis]]. Bush was succeeded on January 20, 2009 by a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president, [[Barack Obama]].

===The Democratic Congress===
[[File:Nancy Pelosi.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, 2007-2011]]
Democrats swept to victory in the [[110th United States Congress|2006 elections]], making [[Nancy Pelosi]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], the first woman in that position, and electing record numbers of women and minorities. Upon winning the elections, the Democrats drew up a [[100-Hour Plan]] of policy proposals upon assuming power in Congress. Major components of the plan included a pay-as-you-go plan for reducing the deficit; enacting the [[9/11 Commission]] recommendations; increasing the [[List of U.S. minimum wages|federal minimum wage]] to $7.25 an hour; allowing the government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to secure lower drug prices for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients; and ending large tax subsidies for big oil companies to help foster energy independence.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barone, and Richard E. Cohen, ''The Almanac of American Politics 2010'' (2009){{page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 110th Congress did little to change the Iraq War except to pass a non-binding resolution against President Bush's troop surge. In addition, the House passed a $124 billion emergency spending measure for war funding with the stipulation of a phased troop withdrawal. President Bush vetoed the bill because of the proposal of scaling down forces, making this the second veto of his term.

During the months of May–June 2007, [[Ted Kennedy]] and other senators co-sponsored the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]]. The purpose of this bill called for immigration reform under the intent of bringing amnesty and citizenship. On June 28 the Senate voted 53–45 for cloture, with 60 votes needed, spelling the end to the 2007 Immigration Bill.

===Financial crisis and recession===
In 2007, while U.S. unemployment dropped to its lowest level since the year 2000, the [[real estate bubble|housing bubble]] reached its peak and economic growth slowed down, and by December 2007, the United States [[Late 2000s recession|entered recession]]. By mid-2008, property values and the values of other assets plummeted, and the stock market crashed in October 2008, spurred by a lack of investor confidence as the liquidity of assets began to evaporate. With the decline in wealth and the lack of investor and consumer confidence, growth and economic activity came to a screeching halt and the job growth of previous years was soon wiped out, with mass layoffs and unemployment rising rapidly in late 2008, and continuing into 2009.

Federal reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] told a federal commission in November 2009, &quot;As a scholar of the Great Depression, I honestly believe that September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.&quot; Of the 13 most important U.S. financial institutions, &quot;12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, [http://www.fcic.gov/report ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'']. 2011. ch. 20. p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury cooperated by pouring trillions into a financial system that had frozen up worldwide. They rescued many of the large financial corporations from bankruptcy – with the exception of [[Lehman Brothers]], which went bankrupt – and took government control of insurance giant AIG, mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and both General Motors and Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'' (2011); and &quot;Resource Library&quot; [http://www.fcic.gov/resource/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In October 2008, Bush sought, and Congress passed, the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (commonly referred to as the &quot;bank bailout&quot;) with the goal of protecting the U.S. financial system from complete collapse in the wake of the [[late-2000s recession]], which brought significant declines in the stock market. The bill provided federal government guarantees of up to $700 billion to troubled financial institutions through the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP). By 2010, only a fraction of that money was ever spent, as banks were able to quickly repay loans from the federal government or ended up never needing the money.

Meanwhile unemployment doubled to nearly 10%, with states such as California and Michigan especially hard hit. While the stock market rebounded by 2011, and corporate profits had recovered, unemployment remained over 9% into 2011.  The recession was worldwide, with Europe and Japan hard hit, while China, India and Canada fared much better.

===The Obama administration===

{{Main|United States presidential election, 2008|Presidency of Barack Obama}}

The nation went into the 2008 election cycle having a Republican president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116500/Presidential-Approval-Ratings-George-Bush.aspx |title=George W. Bush Presidential Job Approval |publisher=Gallup |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Democratic congress&lt;ref name=&quot;CongJob&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pollingreport.com/CongJob.htm |title=Congress: Job Ratings |publisher=PollingReport.com |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; both with extremely low approval ratings. The presidential elections saw the Republican [[John McCain]], the senior Senator from Arizona, with his running mate [[Sarah Palin]], the Governor of Alaska, run against the Democrat [[Barack Obama]], the junior Senator from Illinois, with [[Joe Biden]], the senior Senator from Delaware. The economic crisis of 2008 escalated in the late stages of the campaign and doomed McCain.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Balz and Haynes Johnson, ''The Battle for America 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election'' (2009);  ch 26 is &quot;Palinmania&quot;; ch 27, on the  economy is &quot;Collapse&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated McCain to become the [[President of the United States|44th President of the United States]], making history in becoming the first African-American to be elected to the highest executive office. [[inauguration of Barack Obama|Obama and Biden were inaugurated]] on January 20, 2009.  Part of the strong showing came from a surge of support from younger voters, African Americans, Hispanics and independents. Democrats made further gains in Congress, adding to the majorities they had won in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Todd, and Sheldon Gawiser, ''How Barack Obama Won: A State-by-State Guide to the Historic 2008 Presidential Election'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama's early policy decisions addressed a continuing [[financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/17/obama-signs-billion-stimulus-legislation/ |title=Obama Signs $787 Billion Stimulus Package |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2009-10-17}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have included changes in tax policies, [[foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|foreign policy initiatives]] and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities/ |title=Executive order -- review and disposition of individuals detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and closure of detention facilities |last=Obama |first=Barack |date=2009-01-22 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the deepening recession, Obama signed into law the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], a bill aimed at stimulating the economy which provided $787 billion in federal funds for tax relief, as well as significant investments in infrastructure improvements, social welfare programs, education programs, healthcare, and housing. Other legislative achievements during his term include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] which made sweeping reforms to the U.S. healthcare system, the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] which implemented several new financial regulations to prevent another major financial crisis, and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]]. 

In foreign policy, President Obama withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in large numbers, bringing the [[Iraq War]] to an end in December 2011. At the same time, he also increased troop levels in the [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/world/asia/01orders.html | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | title=Obama Issues Order for More Troops in Afghanistan | date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his presidency, he successfully negotiated the [[New START treaty]] with Russia, which made significant reductions in their nuclear arsenals. The U.S. also maintains ongoing talks, led by Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]], with [[North Korea]] over its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]], as well as with [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] over a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. In May 2011, President Obama announced in a televised speech to the nation that [[al-Qaeda]] leader and culprit behind many deadly acts of terrorism (including the [[September 11 attacks]]) [[Osama bin Laden]] [[Death of Osama bin Laden|was killed]] by U.S. forces at a compound in [[Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]].

Attacking Obama relentlessly, emphasizing the stalled economy, and fueled by the anger of the [[Tea Party Movement]], Republicans scored a landslide in in the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|winning control of the House]] and reducing Democratic margins in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Gary C. Jacobson, &quot;The Republican Resurgence in 2010,&quot; ''Political Science Quarterly'' (2011) 126#1 pp. 27-52 [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/taps/psq/2011/00000126/00000001/art00002 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new Congress, which had a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, President Obama and Congress clashed for months over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend the payroll tax cuts for middle-income citizens that Obama signed into law. After months of heated debate, the debt ceiling was ultimately raised and the tax cuts extended. However, Obama's approval ratings continued to hover at around 46%,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; while Congress had an even lower approval rating of 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/wonkbook-the-least-popular-congress-in-history/2011/12/20/gIQA8mGp6O_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ezra | last=Klein | title=Wonkbook: The least popular Congress in history | date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
