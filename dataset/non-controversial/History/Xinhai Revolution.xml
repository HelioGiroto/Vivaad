The  '''Xinhai Revolution''', or the '''Hsin-hai Revolution''', also known as the '''Revolution of 1911''' or the '''Chinese Revolution''', was a revolution that overthrew China's last [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty]], the [[Qing Dynasty]], and established the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].  The revolution was named Xinhai (Hsin-hai) because it occurred in 1911, the year of the Xinhai stem-branch in the [[sexagenary cycle]] of the [[Chinese calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Li Xing. [2010] (2010). The Rise of China and the Capitalist World Order. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. ISBN 0-7546-7913-6, ISBN 978-0-7546-7913-4. pg 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings.  The turning point was the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on [[Double Ten Day|October 10]], 1911, that was a result of the mishandling of the [[Railway Protection Movement]].  The revolution ended with the abdication of the &quot;[[Emperor of China|Last Emperor]]&quot; [[Emperor Puyi|Puyi]] on February 12, 1912, that marked the end of over 2,000 years of [[History of China#Imperial era|imperial rule]] and the beginning of China's [[History of the Republic of China|republican era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xb1&quot;&gt;Li, Xiaobing. [2007] (2007). A History of the Modern Chinese Army. University Press of Kentucky. ISBN 0-8131-2438-7, ISBN 978-0-8131-2438-4. pg 13. pg 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution arose mainly in response to the decline of the Qing state, which had proven ineffective in its efforts to modernize China and confront new challenges presented by foreign powers, and was exacerbated by ethnic resentment against the ruling [[Manchu]] minority. Many underground anti-Qing groups, with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in exile, tried to overthrow the Qing.  The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between [[Yuan Shikai]], the late Qing military strongman, and [[Sun Yat-sen]], the leader of the [[Tongmenghui|Tongmenghui (United League)]].  After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional coalition government]] was created along with the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]].  However, political power of the [[Beiyang government|new national government]] in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and [[Warlord era|warlordism]], including several attempts at imperial restoration.

Today, both the [[Republic of China]] in [[Taiwan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] on the [[mainland China|mainland]] consider themselves to be successors to the Xinhai Revolution and continue to pay homage to the ideals of the revolution including [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], [[republicanism]], modernization of China and [[Zhonghua minzu|national unity]].  October 10 is commemorated in [[Taiwan]] as [[Double Ten Day]], the National Day of the Republic of China. In [[mainland China]], Hong Kong and [[Macau]], the same day is usually celebrated as the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbs&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvbs.com.tw/news/news_list.asp?no=yehmin20101010132707 雙十節是？ 陸民眾：「國民黨」國慶]. Tvbs.com.tw. Retrieved on October 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[overseas Chinese]] also celebrate the anniversary in [[Chinatown]]s across the world.

In Canada, Kang and Liang formed the [[Progressive Party (China)|Emperor Protection Society]] to promote constitutional monarchy for China.

After suffering its first defeat to the West in the [[First Opium War]] in 1842, the Qing court struggled to contain foreign intrusions into China.  Efforts to adjust and reform the traditional methods of governance were constrained by a deeply conservative court culture where ethnic [[Manchu]] rulers did not want to give too much authority to the [[Han Chinese]] majority.

In the wars against the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping (1851–64)]], [[Nian Rebellion|Nian (1851–1868)]], [[Muslims in China|Muslims]] of [[Panthay Rebellion|Yunnan (1856–1868)]] and [[Dungan revolt|the Northwest (1862–1877)]], the traditional [[Eight Banners|Manchu armies]] proved themselves incompetent, and the court came to rely on local Han armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke106&quot;&gt;Wang, Ke-wen.

Following defeat in the [[Second Opium War]], the Qing tried to modernize by adopting certain Western technologies through the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] from 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Gabe T. [2006] (2006). China and the Taiwan Issue: Impending War at Taiwan Strait. University Press of America. ISBN 0-7618-3434-6, ISBN 978-0-7618-3434-2. pg 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bevir&quot;&gt;Bevir, Mark. [2010] (2010). Encyclopedia of Political Theory. Sage publishing. ISBN 1-4129-5865-2, ISBN 978-1-4129-5865-3. pg 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  This demonstrated that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be modernized if the technological and commercial advancements were to succeed.  In 1898, [[Emperor Guangxu]] was guided by reformers like [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]] for a drastic reform in education, military and economy under the [[Hundred Days Reforms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bevir&quot; /&gt;  The reform was a failure, as it was ended prematurely by a conservative coup led by [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Kang-i Sun.

Pg 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reformers Kang and Liang would be exiled.&lt;ref name=&quot;reillyt&quot; /&gt;  While in Canada, in June 1899, they tried to form the [[Progressive Party (China)|Emperor Protection Society]] in an attempt to restore the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke106&quot; /&gt;  Empress Cixi mainly controlled the Qing dynasty from this point on.  The [[Boxer Rebellion]] prompted another foreign invasion of Beijing in 1900 and the imposition of [[unequal treaty]] terms, which carved away territories, created extraterritorial concessions and gave away trade privileges.  Under internal and external pressure, the Qing court began to adopt some of the reforms.  The Qing managed to maintain its monopoly on political power by suppressing, often with great brutality, all domestic rebellions. Dissidents could operate only in secret societies and underground organizations, in foreign concessions or in exile overseas.

==Organization for revolution==
[[File:Leaders of Revive China Party.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Tse Tsan-tai]], [[Yeung Kui-wan]] (President), [[Sun Yat-sen]], three of the earliest revolutionaries]]

===Earliest groups===
There were many revolutionaries and groups that wanted to overthrow the Qing government to re-establish a [[Han Chinese]] government.  The earliest revolutionary organizations were founded outside of China, such as [[Yeung Kui-wan]]'s [[Furen Literary Society]], created in Hong Kong in 1890.  There were fifteen members, including [[Tse Tsan-tai]], who did political satire such as &quot;The Situation in the Far East&quot;, one of the first ever Chinese [[manhua]], and who later became one of the core founders of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. March 29, 2011. Hong Kong played a key role in the life of Sun Yat-sen.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Revive China Society|Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society)]] was established in [[Honolulu]] in 1894 with the main purpose of raising funds for revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lum, Yansheng Ma. Lum, Raymond Mun Kong. [1999] (1999). Sun Yat-sen in Hawaii: Activities and Supporters. University of Hawaii Press. ISBN 0-8248-2179-3, ISBN 978-0-8248-2179-1. pg 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;  The two organizations were merged in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Curthoys, Ann. Lake, Marilyn. [2005] (2005). Connected Worlds: History in Transnational Perspective. ANU publishing. ISBN 1-920942-44-0, ISBN 978-1-920942-44-1. pg 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smaller groups===
The [[Huaxinghui|Huaxinghui (China Revival Society)]] was founded in 1904 with notables like [[Huang Xing]], [[Zhang Shizhao]], [[Chen Tianhua]] and [[Song Jiaoren]], along with 100 others.  Their motto was &quot;Take one province by force, and inspire the other provinces to rise up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, Stephen R. [2007] (2007). Provincial Patriots: The Hunanese and Modern China. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-02665-9, ISBN 978-0-674-02665-0. pg 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guangfuhui|Guangfuhui (Restoration Society)]] was also founded in 1904, in Shanghai with [[Cai Yuanpei]].  Other notable members include [[Zhang Binglin]] and Tao Chengzhang.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Vincent. Palmer, David A. [2011] (2011). The Religious Question in Modern China. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-30416-7, ISBN 978-0-226-30416-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite professing the anti-Qing cause, the Guangfuhui was highly critical of Sun Yat-sen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke287&quot;&gt;Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism. Taylor &amp; Francis publishing. ISBN 0-8153-0720-9, ISBN 978-0-8153-0720-4. pg 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous female revolutionaries was [[Qiu Jin]], who fought for [[women's rights]] and was also from Guangfuhui.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangke287&quot; /&gt;

There were also many other minor revolutionary organizations, such as Lizhi Xuehui (勵志學會) in [[Jiangsu]], Gongchanghui (公強會) in [[Sichuan]], Yiwenhui (益聞會) and Hanzhudulihui (漢族獨立會) in [[Fujian]], Yizhihui (易知社) in [[Jiangxi]], Yuewanghui (岳王會) in [[Anhui]] and Qunzhihui (群智會/群智社) in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;中国人民大学. 书报资料中心. [1982] (1982). 中国近代史, Issues 1–6. 中国人民大学书报资料社 publishing. University of California press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also criminal organizations that were anti-Manchu, including the [[Green Gang]] and [[Hongmen]] Zhigongtang (致公堂).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Lifu. Chang, Hsu-hsin. Myers, Ramon Hawley.

ISBN 0-8179-9272-3, ISBN 978-0-8179-9272-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sun Yat-sen himself came in contact with the Hongmen, also known as [[Tiandihui|Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth society)]].&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral.

[[Gelaohui|Gelaohui (Elder Brother society)]] was another group, with [[Zhu De]], [[Wu Yuzhang]], Liu Zhidan (劉志丹) and Helong.&lt;ref name=&quot;reillyt&quot; /&gt;  This is the revolutionary group that would eventually develop a strong link with the later [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reillyt&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Sun Yat Sen together with the members of the Singapore Branch of Tongmen Hui.png|thumb|right|250px|Sun Yat-sen with his [[Tongmenghui]]]]

===Tongmenghui===
Sun Yat-sen successfully united the Revive China Society, Huaxingwui and Guangfuhui in the summer of 1905, thereby establishing the unified [[Tongmenghui|Tongmenghui (United League)]] in August 1905 in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=&quot;chinahistvol1&quot;/&gt;  While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country.  Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group.  Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include [[Wang Jingwei]] and [[Hu Hanmin]].  When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui members were between 17 and 26 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Etō, Shinkichi. Schiffrin, Harold Z. [2008] (2008).

===Later groups===
In February 1906, Rizhihui (日知會) also had many revolutionaries, including Sun Wu (孫武), Zhang Nanxian (張難先), He Jiwei and Feng Mumin.&lt;ref&gt;为君丘, 張運宗. [2003] (2003). 走入近代中國. 五南圖書出版股份有限公司.

Digitized Feb 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A nucleus of attendees of this conference evolved into the Tongmenhui's establishment in Hubei.

In July 1907, several members of Tongmenhui in Tokyo advocated a revolution in the area of the [[Yangtze River]].  Liu Quiyi (劉揆一), Jiao Dafeng (焦達峰), Zhang Boxiang (張伯祥) and Sun Wu (孫武) established Gongjinhui (Progressive Association) (共進會).&lt;ref&gt;饒懷民. [2006] (2006). 辛亥革命與清末民初社會/中國近代史事論叢. 中華書局 publishing.

===Views===
{{Main|Anti-Qing sentiment}}
Many revolutionaries promoted anti-Qing/anti-Manchu sentiments and revived memories of conflict between the ethnic minority [[Manchu]] and the ethnic majority [[Han Chinese]] from the late [[Ming Dynasty]].  Leading intellectuals were influenced by books that had survived from the last years of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), the last dynasty of Han Chinese.  In 1904, Sun Yat-sen announced that his organization's goal was &quot;to expel the [[Manchu|Tatar barbarians]], to revive [[Names of China#Zhongguo and Zhonghua|Zhonghua]], to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people.&quot;  (驅除韃虜, 恢復中華, 創立民國, 平均地權).&lt;ref name=&quot;chinahistvol1&quot;&gt;計秋楓, 朱慶葆.

ISBN 962-201-987-0, ISBN 978-962-201-987-4. pg 468.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the underground groups promoted the ideas of &quot;Resist Qing and restore [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]&quot; (反清復明) that had been around since the days of the [[Taiping Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;楊碧玉. 洪秀全政治人格之研究. 秀威資訊科技股份有限公司 publishing.

==Strata and groups==
The Xinhai Revolution was supported by many groups, including students and intellectuals who returned from abroad, as well as participants of the revolutionary organizations, overseas Chinese, soldiers of the new army, local gentry, farmers and others.

Assistance from [[overseas Chinese]] was important in the Xinhai Revolution. In 1894, the first year of the Revive China Society, the first meeting ever held by the group was held in the home of Ho Fon, an overseas Chinese who was the leader of the first Chinese Church of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Khoon Choy Lee.

ISBN 981-256-618-X, 9789812566188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Overseas Chinese supported and actively participated in the funding of revolutionary activities, especially the Southeast Asia Chinese of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] ([[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao&quot;&gt;Gao, James Zheng.

ISBN 0-8108-4930-5, ISBN 978-0-8108-4930-3. pg 156. pg 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these groups were reorganized by Sun, who was referred to as the &quot;mother of the Chinese revolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao&quot; /&gt;

===Newly emerged intellectuals===
In 1906, after the abolition of the [[imperial examinations]], the Qing government established many new schools and encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot;&gt;Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 96. pg 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  A new class of intellectuals emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the Xinhai Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, [[Song Jiaoren]], [[Hu Hanmin]], [[Liao Zhongkai]], [[Zhu Zhixin]] and [[Wang Jingwei]], were all Chinese students in Japan.  Some were young students like [[Zou Rong]], known for writing the book ''Revolutionary Army'', in which he talked about the extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty and tyranny and turned the [[Descendants of Yan &amp; Huang Emperors|sons and grandsons of Yellow Emperor]] into [[George Washington]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby109&quot;&gt;Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1908, revolutionaries focused on coordinating these organizations in preparation for uprisings that these organizations would launch; hence, these groups would provide most of the manpower needed for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen recalled the days of recruiting support for the revolution and said, &quot;The literati were deeply into the search for honors and profits, so they were regarded as having only secondary importance. By contrast, organizations like [[Tiandihui|Sanhehui]] were able to sow widely the ideas of resisting the Qing and restoring the Ming.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Complete works of Sun Yat-sen&quot;《總理全集》 First edition, page 920&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentry and businessmen===
[[File:皇族內閣.png|thumb|left|[[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]] with some royal cabinet members]]
The strength of the gentry in local politics had become apparent. From December 1908, the Qing government created some apparatus to allow the gentry and businessmen to participate in politics.  These middle-class people were originally supporters of constitutionalism. However, they became disenchanted when the Qing government created a cabinet with [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]] as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads, Edward J. M. [2000] (2000).

===Foreigners===
Besides Chinese and overseas Chinese, some of the supporters and participants of the Xinhai Revolution were foreigners; among them, the Japanese were the most active group. Some Japanese even became members of Tongmenghui. [[Miyazaki Touten]] was the closest Japanese supporter; others included Heiyama Shu and [[Ryōhei Uchida]].  British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern also took part in the revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laukit&quot;&gt;Lau, Kit-ching Chan. [1990] (1990). China, Britain and Hong Kong, 1895–1945. Chinese University Press.

===Soldiers of the new armies===
The [[New Army]] was formed in 1901 after the defeat of the Qings in the [[First Sino-Japanese war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt;  They were launched by a decree from eight provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt;  New Army troops were by far the best trained and equipped.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt;  The recruits were of a higher quality than the old army and received regular promotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot; /&gt;  Beginning in 1908, the revolutionaries began to shift their call to the new armies.  Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries infiltrated the New Army.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. [1990] (1990). The Search for Modern China. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Publishing.

==Uprisings and incidents==
The general focus of the uprisings were those that surrounded the [[Tongmenghui]] and Sun Yat-sen, including the smaller groups within.  Some uprisings below involve groups that never merged with the Tongmenghui.  Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8–10 uprisings; all uprisings prior to the [[Wuchang Uprising]] had failed.

===First Guangzhou Uprising===
In the spring of 1895, the [[Revive China Society]], which was based in Hong Kong, planned the First Guangzhou Uprising (廣州起義). [[Lu Haodong]] was tasked with designing the revolutionaries' [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]] flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao&quot; /&gt;  On October 26, 1895, [[Yeung Kui-wan]] and Sun Yat-sen led Zhen Shiliang and Lu Haodong to Guangzhou, preparing to capture Guangzhou in one strike. However, the details of their plans were leaked to the Qing government.&lt;ref name=&quot;z1&quot;&gt;計秋楓, 朱慶葆. [2001] (2001). 中國近代史, Volume 1. Chinese University Press. ISBN 962-201-987-0, ISBN 978-962-201-987-4. pg 464.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government began to arrest revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong, who was later executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;z1&quot; /&gt;  The first Guangzhou uprising was a failure. Under pressure from the Qing government, the government of Hong Kong forbade these two men to enter the territory for five years. Sun Yat-sen went into exile, promoting the Chinese revolution and raising funds in Japan, the United States, Canada and Britain.  In 1901, Yeung Kui-wan was assassinated by Qing agents in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpYkw&quot;&gt;South China morning post.  April 6, 2011.

===Independence Army Uprising===
In 1900, after the [[Boxer Rebellion]] started, Tang Caichang (唐才常) and [[Tan Sitong]] of the previous [[Foot Emancipation Society]] organised the Independence Army.  The Independence Army Uprising (自立軍起義) was planned to occur on August 23, 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang424&quot;&gt;Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998).

Their plot was discovered by the governor general of Hunan and Hubei.  About twenty conspirators were arrested and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang424&quot; /&gt;

===Huizhou Uprising===
On October 8, 1900, Sun Yat-sen ordered the launch of the Huizhou Uprising (惠州起義).&lt;ref&gt;Gao, James Zheng. [2009] (2009). Historical dictionary of modern China (1800–1949). Scarecrow press.

However, after the [[Hirobumi Ito|Japanese Prime Minister]] prohibited Sun Yat-sen from carrying out revolutionary activities on Taiwan, Zheng Shiliang had no choice but to order the army to disperse. This uprising therefore also failed.  British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern participated in this uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laukit&quot; /&gt;

The Literary Society (文學社) and the Progressive Association (共進會) were revolutionary organizations involved in the uprising that mainly began with a [[Railway Protection Movement]] protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang390&quot;/&gt;  In the late summer, some Hubei New Army units were ordered to neighboring Sichuan to quell the Railway Protection Movement, a mass protest against the Qing government's seizure and handover of local railway development ventures to foreign powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;reillyt&quot; /&gt; [[Eight Banner|Banner]] officers like [[Duanfang]], the railroad superintendent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1979|publisher=University of Iowa|quote=The railway company's chief officer at Yichang was no longer listening to company directives and had turned company accounts over to Duanfang, Superintendent of the Chuan Han and Yue Han railroads.

The New Army units of Hubei had originally been the Hubei Army, which had been trained by Qing official [[Zhang Zhidong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xb1&quot; /&gt;  On September 24, the Literary Society and Progressive Association convened a conference in Wuchang, along with sixty representatives from local New Army units. During the conference, they established a headquarters for the uprising. The leaders of the two organizations, Jiang Yiwu (蔣翊武) and Sun Wu (孫武), were elected as commander and chief of staff.  Initially, the date of the uprising was to be October 6, 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong2&quot;&gt;王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 No.&amp;nbsp;6 民國. 中華書局.

Revolutionaries intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty had built bombs, and on October 9, one accidentally exploded.&lt;ref name=&quot;gongtong2&quot; /&gt;  Sun Yat-sen himself had no direct part in the uprising and was traveling in the United States at the time in an effort to recruit more support from among overseas Chinese. The Qing [[Viceroy of Huguang]], Rui Cheng (瑞澂), tried to track down and arrest the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi1&quot;&gt;戴逸, 龔書鐸. [2002] (2003) 中國通史. 清. Intelligence press.

That evening, they established a tactical headquarters and announced the establishment of the &quot;Military Government of Hubei of Republic of China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi1&quot; /&gt;  The conference chose [[Li Yuanhong]] as the governor of the temporary government.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonsi1&quot; /&gt; Qing officers like the bannermen Duanfang and Zhao Erfeng were killed by the revolutionary forces.

==After Wuchang, echoes from other provinces==
[[File:Qing Dynasty Map durnig Xinhai Revolution.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Uprising map during the Xinhai revolution]]
After the success of the Wuchang Uprising, many other uprisings occurred in other cities and towns in other provinces.  Many of the uprisings were followed up with restorations (光復).  Some uprisings were more of a revolt for independence, and some were protests or rebellions against local officials, but the outcome was that basically all provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the Republic of China.

After considering the possibility that the new republic might be defeated in a civil war or by foreign invasion, Sun Yat-sen agreed to Yuan's proposal to unify China under Yuan Shikai's Beijing government.  Further decisions were made to let the emperor rule over his little court in the [[New Summer Palace]].  He would be treated as a ruler of a separate country and have expenses of several million [[taels]] in silver.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, Youlan Feng. Mair, Denis C. [2000] (2000).

During and after the Xinhai Revolution, many groups that participated wanted their own pennant as the national flag.  During the Wuchang Uprising, the military units of Wuchang wanted the nine-star flag with [[Taijitu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fitzj&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald, John. [1998] (1998).

===Donghuamen incident===
On January 16, while returning to his residence, Yuan Shikai was ambushed in a bomb attack organized by the Tongmenghui in Donghuamen (東華門), [[Tientsin]], Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;gg&quot;&gt;邵建.

===Abdication of the emperor===
{{main|Puyi#Abdication}}
On January 20, [[Wu Tingfang]] of the Nanking Provisional Government officially delivered the [[Puyi#Abdication|imperial edict of abdication]] to Yuan Shikai the terms for the [[abdication]] of [[Puyi|Qing Emperor Xuantong Puyi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads228&quot; /&gt;  It was drafted by [[Zhang Jian (politician)|Zhang Jian]], and was approved by the Provisional senate.  On January 22, Sun Yat-sen announced that if Yuan Shikai supported the emperor's abdication, he (Sun Yat-sen) would resign the presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, Howard L.

ISBN 0-231-08957-0, ISBN 978-0-231-08957-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Yuan received this promise, he sped up the process. He threatened [[Empress Longyu]] that if the revolutionaries come to Beijing, the lives of the royal family would not be spared, but if they agree to abdicate, the terms for their abdication would be honored.

On February 3, Empress Longyu gave Yuan Shikai full permission to negotiate the terms for the abdication of the Qing Emperor.  Yuan then drew up his own version and forwarded it back to the revolutionaries on February 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads228&quot; /&gt;  His version consisted of three sections instead of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads228&quot; /&gt;  On February 12, 1912, after being persuaded and pressured by Yuan Shikai and other ministers, Puyi (age six) and [[Empress Longyu]] accepted the terms for the imperial family's abdication.&lt;ref&gt;Welland, Sasah Su-ling.

==Change of capital==
===Dong'anmen gate incident===
The revolutionaries were trying to lure Yuan Shikai to the South.  By making Yuan the president of the southern Nanking-based provisional government, he would have to give up his military power base in the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;wangj&quot;&gt;Wang, Jun.

The [[Republic of China National Assembly elections, 1912|first National Assembly election]] took place according to the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China|Provisional Constitution]].

==Legacy==
===Social influence===
After the revolution, there was a huge outpouring of anti-Manchu literature.  One example is [[Wang Xiuchu]]'s graphical account of the [[Yangzhou massacre|ten-day Chinese massacre in Yangzhou]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads266&quot; /&gt;  Others are ''A Short History of [[Nucai|Slaves]]'' (奴才小史) and ''The Biographies of Avaricious Officials and Corrupt Personnel'' (貪官污吏傳) by Laoli (老吏).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads266&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ckd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ulrich Theobald |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature//Poetry/manqingyeshi.html |title=Chinese Literature - Man-Qing yeshi 滿淸野史 |publisher=www.chinaknowledge.de |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other books were written about the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;ckd&quot; /&gt;  During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Longyu, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of &quot;Manchu and Han as one family&quot; (滿漢一家).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoads266&quot;&gt;Rhoads, Edward J.

Unlike revolutions in the West, the Xinhai Revolution did not restructure society. The participants of the Xinhai Revolution were mostly military personnel, old-type bureaucrats, and local gentries. These people still held regional power after the Xinhai Revolution. Some became warlords.  There were no major improvements in the [[standard of living]]. Writer [[Lu Xun]] commented in 1921 during the publishing of ''[[The True Story of Ah Q]]'', ten years after the Xinhai Revolution, that basically nothing changed except &quot;the Manchus have left the kitchen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby, Jonathan.

The Xinhai Revolution mainly got rid of [[feudalism]] ([[fengjian]]) from [[Late Imperial China]].  In the usual view of historians, there are two restorations of feudal power after the revolution: the first was Yuan Shikai; the second was [[Zhang Xun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yanjia&quot;&gt;Yan, Jiaqi Yan.

===Historical significance===
The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing government and two thousand years of monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;xb1&quot; /&gt; Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The Xinhai Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout China. Though in 1911 at the provisional government welcome ceremony, Sun Yat-sen said, &quot;The revolution is not yet successful, the [[comrade]]s still need to strive for the future.&quot; (革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力).&lt;ref&gt;陸韻葭. [2006] (2006). 上海玩全指南. Travelcom press. ISBN 986-7143-13-2, ISBN 978-986-7143-13-6. pg 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1920s, the two dominant parties–the KMT and CPC–see the Xinhai Revolution quite differently.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpr&quot;&gt;South China morning post. March 29, 2011. Replacing Chairman Mao with Sun Yat-sen.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both sides recognize Sun Yat-sen as the [[Father of the Nation]], but in Taiwan, they mean &quot;Father of the Republic of China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpr&quot; /&gt;  The father of [[People's Republic of China|New China]] is seen as [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpr&quot; /&gt;  On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state founded in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpr&quot; /&gt;  The PRC views Sun's work as the first step towards the real revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpr&quot; /&gt;  In 1954, [[Liu Shaoqi]] was quoted as saying that the &quot;Xinhai Revolution inserted the concept of a republic into common people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Takungpao.com |url=http://source.takungpao.com/history/history_news_content.asp?news_id=144612 |title=1911 |publisher=Takungpao.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1059 |url=http://dangshi.people.com.cn/BIG5/151935/230642/230643/15697798.html |title=劉少奇談辛亥革命（摘要）-中國共產黨新聞 |publisher=Dangshi.people.com.cn |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zhou Enlai]] pointed out that the &quot;Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 2000 years of monarchy, and liberated the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the development of future revolution. This is a great victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.ifeng.com/gate/big5/cq.city.ifeng.com/detail-1_2011_09/24/86579_0.shtml |title=王志昆講重慶辛亥革命：為什麼兵不血刃，一次成功_重慶_重慶站_鳳凰網 |publisher=Big5.ifeng.com |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern evaluation===
[[File:Taiw 100ann 10yuan.jpg|thumb|300px|Commemorative coin, minted in Taiwan in 2011]]
A change in the belief that the revolution had been a generally positive change began in late 1980s and 1990s, but [[Zhang Shizhao]] was quoted as arguing that &quot;When talking about the Xinhai Revolution, the theorist these days tends to overemphasize. The word 'success' was way overused.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;章士釗. [2000] (1962). 孫黃遺劄密詮，載章士釗全集第8卷. 上海: 文彙出版社 publishing. pg 341. ISBN 780531543.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the democracy gained from the revolution can vary depending on one's view. Even after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all five branches of the government; none were independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpjul4&quot;&gt;South China morning post. Sun Yat-sen and the centenary of the Xinhai revolution. 4 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yan Jiaqi]], founder of the [[Federation for a Democratic China]], has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic is the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yanjia&quot; /&gt;  In 2011, president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] praised the Western political model for the successful democratization of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oct 12, 2011 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MJ12Ad01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: Taiwan's Ma bares his centennial steel |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy are far from realised on the mainland.  For example, the Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]] once said in a speech that without real democracy, there is no guarantee of economic and political rights; but he led a [[2011 crackdown on dissidents in the People's Republic of China|2011 crackdown]] against the peaceful [[2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests|Chinese jasmine protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pomfret |first=James |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/27/us-britain-china-democracy-idUSTRE75Q50S20110627 |title=China's Wen calls for greater democracy, reforms |publisher=Reuters |date= June 27, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Liu Xiaobo]], a pro-democracy activist who received the global [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]], is in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Yomiuri Shimbun |url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/editorial/T111013004821.htm |title=100 years on, China far from democracy : Editorial : DAILY YOMIURI ONLINE (The Daily Yomiuri) |publisher=Yomiuri.co.jp |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as Qin Yongmin (秦永敏) of the [[Democracy Party of China]], who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/10-9-2011/87338.htm |title=China grapples with revolutionary past, 100 years on |publisher=GEO.tv |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrichina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrichina.org/content/4879 |title=Democracy Activist Qin Yongmin Released from Prison after 12-Year Sentence &amp;#124; Human Rights in China 中国人权 |publisher=Hrichina.org |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qin Yogmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that [[Mao Zedong]] was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;geo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrichina&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/lifestyle/a/-/lifestyle/10429558/china-grapples-with-revolutionary-past-100-years-on/ |title=China grapples with revolutionary past, 100 years on - The West Australian |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
