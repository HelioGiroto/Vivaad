      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70038">{{History of Portugal}}
The history of [[Portugal]], a [[Europe]]an and  an [[Atlantic]] [[nation]], dates back to the Early [[Middle Ages]]. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|ascended]] to the status of a [[world power]] during Europe's &quot;[[Age of Discovery]]&quot; as it [[Portuguese Empire|built up a vast empire]] including possessions in [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]]. In the next two centuries, Portugal gradually lost much of its wealth and status as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[England|English]] and [[France|French]] took an increasing share of the [[Spice trade|spice]] and [[slave trade]]s (the economic basis of its empire), by surrounding or conquering the widely-scattered Portuguese trading posts and territories, leaving it with ever fewer resources to defend its overseas interests.

Signs of military decline began with two disastrous battles: the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]] in Morocco in 1578 and Spain's abortive [[Spanish Armada|attempt]] to conquer England in 1588 - Portugal was then in a [[Iberian Union|dynastic union with Spain]], and contributed ships to the Spanish invasion fleet. The country was further weakened by the destruction of much of its capital city in a [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 earthquake]], occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the loss of its largest colony, [[Brazil]], in 1822. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two-million [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] left Europe to live in Brazil and the United States (U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=77 |title=Portugal Seeks Balance of Emigration, Immigration |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date=2002-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, there was a revolution that deposed the monarchy. Amid corruption, repression of the church, and the near bankruptcy of the state, a [[military coup]] in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal's African colonies in 1975.

Portugal is a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). It entered the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1986.

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;

Portugal's name derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name '''''[[Portus Cale]]'''''. Cale was the name of an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]], which flows into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the north of what is now Portugal. Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of [[Portus Cale|Cale]]''). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suevi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''.

The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern border between Portugal and [[Spain]]. By the 11th and 12th century, ''Portugale'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.

The etymology of the name ''Cale'' is mysterious, as is the identity of the town's founders. Some historians have argued that Greeks were the first to settle Cale and that the name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''kallis'' (καλλις), 'beautiful', referring to the beauty of the Douro valley. Still others have claimed that ''Cale'' originated in the language of the [[Gallaeci]] people indigenous to the surrounding region (see below). Others argue that Cale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=lisbon+etymology&amp;lr=#PPA55,M1 |title=Local etymology: a derivative ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is  a Celtic name like many others found in the region. The word ''cale'' or ''cala'', would mean 'port', an 'inlet' or 'harbour,' and implied the existence of an older Celtic harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=POGEbFpGHigC&amp;pg=RA1-PA270&amp;dq=celtic+cale+harbour&amp;lr=&amp;sig=RIIpretXAIvSW54ICvMH82IDcrw |title=Celtic Linguistics |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue it is the stem of Gallaecia. Another theory claims it derives from ''[[Caladunum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_sYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA477&amp;dq=Cale,++name++Porto+greek&amp;lr= |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the ''Portu'' part of the name ''Portucale'' became ''[[Porto]]'', the modern name for the city located on the site of the ancient city of Cale at the mouth of the Douro River. And ''[[port wine|Port]]'' became the name in English of the wine from the Douro Valley region around Porto. The name ''Cale'' is today reflected in ''Gaia'' ([[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), a city on the left bank of the river.

== Early History ==
=== Neolithic ===
{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}
[[Image:Iberia 300BC.svg|thumb|350px|The main language areas in Iberia, circa 300 BC.]]
The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by [[Homo sapiens]], who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birmp1&quot;&gt;David Birmingham (2003), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsistence societies that, although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did establish organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the raising of some cereal crops and pluvial or marine fishing.&lt;ref name=Birmp1/&gt;

Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] invaded Portugal from [[central Europe]] and inter-married with the local populations, forming [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|different ethnic groups]], with many tribes. Chief among these tribes were the [[Gallaecia|Calaicians or Gallaeci of northern Portugal]], the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanians of central Portugal]], the  [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the lesser tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]].

There were in the southern part the country, some small, semi-permanent commercial coastal settlements founded by [[Phoenicians]]-[[Carthaginians]] (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], in the Algarve).

The [[Tartessian language]] from the southwest of the Iberian peninsula, which [[John T. Koch]] has claimed to be able to translate, has been accepted by philologists and other linguists as the first attested Celtic language.&lt;ref name=Koch2009&gt;{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher = Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 339–351 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | doi =  | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf|title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt; From later 2011, Tartessian was classified as a Celtic language&lt;ref name=villarceltic&gt;{{cite book|last=Villar, Prósper, Jordán, Pilar Fernández Álvarez|first=F., B.

=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===
{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}

[[Image:Conímbriga - rosto.jpg|thumb|250px|Ancient Roman mosaic in [[Conimbriga]].]]

The first Roman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula occurred in 219 BC. Within 200 years, almost the entire peninsula had been annexed to the [[Roman Republic]]. The [[Carthaginians]], Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies.

The Roman conquest of what is now part of modern day Portugal took several decades: it started from the south, where the Romans found friendly natives, the [[Conii]]. It suffered a severe setback in 150 BC, when a rebellion began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of the Portuguese land. Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail&amp;nbsp;— the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's ambassador to kill his own leader. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated, and the resistance was soon over.

Rome installed a colonial regime. During this period, Lusitania grew in prosperity and many of modern day Portugal's cities and towns were founded. The complete Romanization of Portugal, intensified during the rule of [[Augustus]], took three centuries and was stronger in Southern Portugal, most of which were administrative dependencies of the Roman city of Pax Julia, currently known as [[Beja]]. The city was named Pax Julia in honour of [[Julius Caesar]] and to celebrate peace in Lusitania. Augustus renamed it Pax Augusta, but the early name prevailed. In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].

Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal, some urban remains are quite large, like Conimbriga and Mirobriga. Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circus, theatres and layman's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some of which coined in Portuguese land, sarcophagus and ceramics are numerous. Contemporary historians include [[Paulus Orosius]] (c. 375-418)&lt;ref&gt;David Rohrbacher, &quot;Orosius,&quot; in ''The Historians of Late Antiquity'' (Routledge, 2002), [http://books.google.com/books?id=TLvK-_fk8TkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Orosius+life+OR+biography+OR+born+OR+birth&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2atlXMBUN45DliVbnt_fLlckZInw pp. 135–137.] Rohrbacher bases the date of birth on Augustine's description of Orosius as a &quot;young priest&quot; and a &quot;son by age&quot; in the period 414–418, which would place his age at 30 or younger.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydatius]] (c. 400–469), bishop of [[Aquae Flaviae]], who reported on the final years of the roman rule and arrival of the Germanic tribes.

=== Germanic kingdoms (5th–7th centuries) ===
{{Main|Visigoths|Suevi}}
[[Image:Hispania 560 AD.PNG|thumb|250px|Germanic kingdoms in Iberia, 560.]]
In the early 5th century, [[Germanic tribes]] invaded the peninsula, namely the [[Suevi]], the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) and their allies, the [[Sarmatia]]n [[Alans]]. Only the kingdom of the [[Suevi]] ([[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]]) endured after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the [[Visigoths]], who conquered all of the Iberian Peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suevi kingdom and its capital city [[Bracara]] in 584–585.

The Germanic tribe of the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]] also accompanied the Suevi in their invasion of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and colonization of [[Gallaecia]] (modern [[Norte, Portugal|northern Portugal]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). The Buri settled in the region between the rivers [[Cávado River|Cávado]] and [[Homem River|Homem]], in the area known as thereafter as ''Terras de Boiro'' or ''Terras de Bouro'' (Lands of the Buri).&lt;ref&gt;Domingos Maria da Silva, ''Os Búrios'', Terras de Bouro, Câmara Municipal de Terras de Bouro, 2006. (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor influences from this period include some 5th century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlement, which were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], [[Coimbra]] and even [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;Milhazes, José.

== Moorish rule and the Reconquista (711–1249) ==
{{Main|Al-Andalus|Reconquista|History of Portugal (1112–1279)}}

[[Image:Interior da Igreja Matriz, de Mértola.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mértola]]'s mosque was transformed into a Christian church in 1238.]]
Landing near Algeciras in the spring of 711, the [[Islam]]ic [[Moors]] (mainly [[Berber people|Berber]]s with some [[Arab]]s) from [[North Africa]] invaded the Iberian Peninsula.,&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'' (Cambridge University Press: London, 1969) pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; destroying the [[Visigoth]]ic Kingdom. Many of the ousted Gothic nobles took refuge in the unconquered north [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturian highlands]]. From there they aimed to reconquer their lands from the Moors: this war of reconquest is known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) as the ''[[Reconquista]]''.

In 868, Count [[Vímara Peres]] reconquered and governed the region between the rivers [[Minho River|Minho]] and [[Douro]]. The county was then known as ''Portucale'' (i.e., Portugal).

While it had its origins as a dependency of the [[Kingdom of León]], Portugal occasionally gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns.

Portugal gained its first ''de jure'' independence (as the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Portugal]]) in 1065 under the rule of [[Garcia II of Galicia and Portugal|Garcia II]]. Because of feudal power struggles, Portuguese and Galician nobles rebelled. In 1072, the country rejoined [[Kingdom of León|León]] under Garcia II's brother [[Alfonso VI of León]].

[[Image:Spanish reconquista.gif|thumb|350px|The [[Reconquista]], 790-1300.]]
In 1095, Portugal separated almost completely from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. Its territories consisting largely of mountain, moorland and forest were bounded on the north by the Minho, on the south by the [[Mondego River]].

== Independence ==
At the end of the 11th century, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended his independence, merging the County of Portucale and the County of [[Coimbra]]. Henry declared independence for Portugal while a civil war raged between [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].

Henry died without achieving his aims. His son, [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], took control of the county. The city of Braga, the unofficial Catholic centre of the Iberian Peninsula, faced new competition from other regions. Lords of the cities of Coimbra and [[Porto]] (then Portucale) with [[Braga]]'s clergy demanded the independence of the renewed county.

Portugal traces its national origin to 24 June 1128, with the [[Battle of São Mamede]]. Afonso proclaimed himself first ''Prince of Portugal'' and in 1139 the first ''King of Portugal''. By 1143, with the assistance of a representative of the [[Holy See]] at the conference of Zamora, Portugal was formally recognized as independent, with the prince recognized as ''Dux Portucalensis''. In 1179 [[Afonso I]] was declared, by the [[Pope]], as king. After the [[Battle of São Mamede]], the first capital of Portugal was [[Guimarães]] from which the first king ruled. Later, when Portugal was already officially independent, he ruled from [[Coimbra]].

=== Affirmation of Portugal ===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1279–1415)}}
From 1249 to 1250 the Algarve, the southernmost region, was finally re-conquered by Portugal from the [[Moors]]. In 1255 the capital shifted to [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'' (Cambridge University Press: London, 1969) p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighboring Spain would not complete their ''Reconquista'' until 1492 almost 250 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875: A Modern History'' (University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor, 1970) pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's land-based boundaries have been notably stable in history. The border with Spain has remained almost unchanged since the 13th century. The [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)]] created an alliance between Portugal and [[Kingdom of England|England]] that remains in effect to this day. Since early times, fishing and overseas commerce have been the main economic activities. [[Henry the Navigator]]'s interest in exploration together with some technological developments in navigation made Portugal's expansion possible and led to great advances in geographic, mathematical, scientific knowledge and technology, more specifically naval technology.

== Naval exploration and Portuguese Empire (15th-16th centuries) ==
{{Main|Portugal in the period of discoveries|Portuguese Empire}}

[[Image:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|500px|Portuguese discoveries and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue); territories of the [[Portuguese empire]] under [[King John III of Portugal|King John III]] rule (1521-1557) (green). The [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|disputed discovery of Australia]] is not shown.]]

During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal was a leading European power, ranking with [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] in terms of economic, political, and cultural influence. Though not predominant in European affairs, Portugal did have an extensive colonial trading empire throughout the world backed by a powerful [[thalassocracy]].

July 25, 1415 marked the beginning of the [[Portuguese Empire]], when the Portuguese Armada departed to the rich trade [[Islamic]] centre of [[Ceuta]] in [[North Africa]] with King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] and his wife Phillipa of Lancaster and their sons Prince [[Duarte of Portugal|Duarte]] (future king), Prince Pedro, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] (born in Porto in 1394) and Prince Afonso, and legendary Portuguese hero [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]].&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'' (Cambridge University Press: London, 1969) pp. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 21, 1415, Ceuta, the city on the coast of North Africa directly across from Gibraltar, was conquered by Portugal, and the long-lived Portuguese Empire was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of Ceuta had been helped by the fact that a major civil war had been engaging the Muslims of the Magrib (North Africa) since 1411.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  This same civil war between the Muslims prevented a re-capture of Ceuta from the Portuguese, when [[Muhammad IX]], the Left-Handed King of [[Granada]], laid siege to Ceuta and attempted to coordinate the forces in Morocco and attempted to get aid and assistance for the effort from Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Muslim attempt to retake Ceuta was ultimately unsuccessful and Ceuta remained the first part of the new Portuguese Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, further steps were taken that would soon expand the Portuguese Empire.

In 1418 two of the captains of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to an island which they called [[Porto Santo island|Porto Santo]] (&quot;Holy Port&quot;) in gratitude for their rescue from the shipwreck.  In 1419, [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] disembarked on [[Madeira Island]].  Uninhabited Madeira Island was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1427 and 1431, most of the [[Azores Islands|Azorean islands]] were discovered and these uninhabited islands were colonized by the Portuguese in 1445. A Portuguese expedition may have attempted to colonize the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canary Islands]] as early as 1336, but [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] objected to any claim by the Portuguese to the Canary Islands. Castile began its conquest of the Canaries in 1402. Castile expelled the last Portuguese from the Canary islands 1459. The Canary Islands would eventually be part of the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875: A Modern History'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1434, [[Gil Eanes]] turned the [[Cape Bojador]], south of [[Morocco]]. The trip marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of [[Africa]].  Before the turn, very little information was known in Europe about what lay around the cape. At the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, those who tried to venture there became lost, which gave birth to legends of [[sea monster]]s. Some setbacks occurred: in 1436 the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canaries]] were officially recognized as Castilian by the Pope; earlier they were recognized as Portuguese. Also, in 1438 in a military expedition to [[Tangier#History|Tangier]], the Portuguese were defeated.

However, the Portuguese did not give up their exploratory efforts. In 1448, on a small island known as [[Arguim]] off the coast of [[Mauritania]], an important castle was built, working as a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'', a trading post, for commerce with inland Africa. Some years before the first African [[gold]] was brought to Portugal, circumventing the Arab caravans that crossed the Sahara. Some time later, the [[caravel]]s explored the Gulf of Guinea which lead to the discovery of several uninhabited islands: [[Cape Verde]], [[Fernando Póo (island)|Fernão Póo]], [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]], [[Principe Island|Príncipe]] and [[Annobón]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875: A Modern History'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 1460, Prince Henry the Navigator died.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been the leading patron of all maritime exploration by Portugal up to that time. Immediately following Henry's death, there was a lapse of further exploration. Henry's patronage of explorations had shown that profits could be made in trade which followed the exploration of new lands. Accordingly when exploration was commenced again private merchants led the way in attempting to stretch trade routes further down the African coast.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1470s, Portuguese trading ships reached the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1471, the Portuguese captured Tangier, after years of attempts. Eleven years later in 1482, the fortress of [[São Jorge da Mina]] in the town of [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was built.  (Setting sail aboard the fleet of ships taking the materials and building crews to Elmina on this trip in December 1481 was [[Christopher Columbus]].)  In 1483, [[Diogo Cão]] reached and explored the [[Congo River]].

=== The New World ===

In 1484, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching [[India]] from the west, because it was seen as unreasonable. Some historians have claimed that the Portuguese had already performed fairly accurate calculations concerning the size of the world and therefore knew that sailing west to reach the Indies would require a far longer journey than navigating to the east. However, this continues to be debated. Thus began a long-lasting dispute which eventually resulted in the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Spain in 1494. The treaty divided the (largely undiscovered) world equally between the Spanish and the Portuguese, along a north-south [[Prime Meridian|meridian line]] 370 leagues (1770&amp;nbsp;km/1100 miles) west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands, with all lands to the east belonging to Portugal and all lands to the west to Spain.

[[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]
A remarkable achievement was the turning of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  The richness of [[India]] was now accessible.  Indeed the name of the cape stems from this promise of rich trade with the east. In 1489, the King of [[Bemobi]] gave his realms to the Portuguese king and became [[Christian]]. Between 1491 and 1494, [[Pêro de Barcelos]] and [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] explored [[North America]]. At the same time, [[Pêro da Covilhã]] reached [[Ethiopia]] by land. [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed for India, and arrived at [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498, returning in glory to Portugal the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hallett, ''Africa to 1875: A Modern History'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Monastery of Jerónimos]] was built, dedicated to the discovery of the route to India.

In the spring of 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] set sail from Cape Verde with 13 ships and crews and a list of nobles that included [[Nicolau Coelho]], [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and his brother Diogo, [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] (author of the ''Esmeraldo'') along with various other nobles, nine chaplains and some 1,200 men.&lt;ref&gt;H.V. Livermore, A New History of Portugal, p. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt;  From Cape Verde they sailed southwest across the Atlantic.  On April 22, 1500, they caught sight of land in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  They disembarked and claimed this new land for Portugal.  This was the coast of what would later become the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the real goal of the expedition was to open sea trade to the empires of the east. Trade with the east had effectively been cut off since the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  Accordingly, Cabral turned from exploring the coasts of the new land of Brazil and sailed to the southeast back across the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope. Cabral reached [[Sofala]] on the east coast of Africa in July 1500.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1505, a Portuguese fort would be established here and the land around the fort would become the Portuguese colony of Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hallett, Africa to 1875: A Modern History, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then they sailed on to the east and landed in [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] in India in September 1500.&lt;ref&gt;H.V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'', p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here they traded for pepper and, more significantly opened European sea trade with the empires of the east.  No longer would the Islamic occupation of Constantinople form a barrier between Europe and the east.Ten years later in 1510, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] after attempting and failing to capture and occupy [[Zamorin]]'s Calicut militarily, conquered [[Goa]] on the west coast of India.&lt;ref&gt;Percival Spear, India: A Modern History (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1961) pp. 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[João da Nova]] discovered [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] in 1501 and [[Saint Helena]] in 1502; [[Tristão da Cunha]] was the first to sight the archipelago still known by his name 1506.  In 1505, [[Francisco de Almeida]] was engaged to improve the Portuguese trade with the far east.  Accordingly, he sailed to East Africa.  Several small Islamic states along the coast of [[Mozambique]], [[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Mombasa]] were destroyed or became subjects or allies of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almeida then sailed on to [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], made peace with the ruler and built a stone fort there.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Portuguese arrival in Japan.jpg|thumb|250px|The arrival of the Portuguese in [[Japan]], the first Europeans who managed to reach it, initiating the ''[[Nanban trade period|Nanban]]'' (&quot;southern barbarian&quot;) period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.]]

The two million Portuguese people ruled a vast empire with many millions of inhabitants in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. From 1514, the Portuguese had reached [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Arabian Sea]], one of Cabral's ships discovered [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] (1507); [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506, and in the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] visited [[Ceylon]].

In the [[Red Sea]], [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]]. [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]], in the [[Persian Gulf]], was seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1515, who also entered into diplomatic relations with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1521, a force under [[Antonio Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]] ushering in a period of almost 80 years of Portuguese rule of the Persian Gulf archipelago&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p37&lt;/ref&gt; (for further information see [[History of Bahrain#Bahrain as a Portuguese dominion|Bahrain as a Portuguese dominion]]).

On the Asiatic mainland the first trading stations were established by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] at Cochin and Calicut (1501); more important were the conquests of [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510) and [[Malacca]] (1511) by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], and the acquisition of [[Diu, India|Diu]] (1535) by [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]]. East of Malacca Albuquerque sent [[Duarte Fernandes]] as envoy to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) in 1511, and dispatched to the Moluccas two expeditions (1512, 1514), which founded the Portuguese dominion in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, A New History of Portugal, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese established their base in the [[Spice Islands]] on the island of [[Ambon]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Brown, ''A Short History of Indonesia: The Unlikely Nation'', (Allen &amp; Unwin Pub.: Crows Nest, New South Wales, Australia, 2003) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in 1517 and opened up trade with China, where in 1557 the Portuguese were permitted to occupy [[Macau]]. [[Japan]], accidentally reached by three Portuguese traders in 1542, soon attracted large numbers of merchants and missionaries. In 1522 one of the ships in the expedition that [[Ferdinand Magellan]] organized in the Spanish service completed the first [[circumnavigation|voyage around the world]].

By the end of the 15th century, Portugal expelled some [[Sephardim|local Jews]], along with those refugees that came from [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] after 1492. In addition, many Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism and remained as [[Converso]]s. Many Jews remained [[Crypto-Jew|secretly Jewish]], in danger of persecution by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. In 1506, 3,000 &quot;New Christians&quot; were massacred in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Weiner,[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Portugal]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1580 crisis, Iberian Union and decline of the Empire ==
{{Main|1580 Portuguese succession crisis|Iberian Union|Dutch–Portuguese War}}

On August 4, 1578, while fighting in Morocco, young King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] died in battle without an heir and his body was not found.&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Livermore, A New History of Portugal, pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; His death lead to a [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|dynastic crisis]]. The late king's elderly granduncle, Cardinal [[Henry I of Portugal|Henry]], became king.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry I died a mere two years later on January 31, 1580.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal was worried about the maintenance of its independence and sought help to find a new king.

[[Philip II of Spain]] was on his mother's side the grandson of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], and on that basis claimed the Portuguese throne.  He was opposed by [[António, Prior of Crato]], the illegitimate son of one of the younger sons of Manuel I. As a result, following Henry's death Spain invaded Portugal and the Spanish king became Philip I of Portugal in 1580. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and Portuguese Empires came under a single rule.

This did not, however, end resistance to Spanish rule. The Prior of Crato held out in the [[Azores]] until 1583, and continued to actively seek to recover the throne until his death in 1595. [[Impostor]]s claimed to be [[King Sebastian]] in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598. &quot;[[Sebastianism]]&quot;, the myth that the young king will return to Portugal on a foggy day, has prevailed until modern times.

After the 16th century, Portugal gradually saw its wealth decreasing. Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but, in actuality, the country was under the rule of the [[Spain|Spanish]] from [[Iberian Union|1580 to 1640]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp. 163-172.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Consejo de Portugal'' independent inasmuch as it was one of the key administrative units used by the Castilian monarchy, on legally equal terms with the [[Council of the Indies|Consejo de Indias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=J.H.|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-14-100703-6|pages=274|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and Spain's enemies became Portugal's. [[England]] had been an ally of Portugal since the [[Treaty of Windsor 1386|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386. War between Spain and England led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally, and the loss of [[Ormus|Hormuz]]. From 1595 to 1663 [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] led to invasions of many countries in [[Asia]] and commercial interests in [[Japan]], [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. In 1624, the Dutch seized [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], the capital of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1630, the Dutch seized Pernambuco in northern Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Treaty of 1654 returned Pernambuco to Portuguese control.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the English and the Dutch continued to aspire to dominate both the Atlantic slave trade and the spice trade with the Far East.

The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The Seven Provinces (the Dutch) captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the entire coasts except that of Bahia and much of the interior of most [[Northeast Region, Brazil|contemporary Northeastern states]] ([[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], [[Alagoas]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and [[Ceará]]), while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s.

This was reversed, beginning with a major Spanish-Portuguese military operation in 1625. This laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over some lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

== Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1668) ==
{{Main|Portuguese Restoration War}}

At home, life was calm and serene with the first two Spanish kings; they maintained Portugal's status, gave excellent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish [[Noble court|courts]], and Portugal maintained an independent law, currency and government.  It was even proposed to move the Spanish capital to [[Lisbon]].  Later, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles lost power.

Because of this, as well as the general strain on the finances of the Spanish throne as a result of the [[Thirty Years War]], on 1 December 1640, the [[Duke of Braganza]], one of the great native noblemen and a descendant of King Manuel I, was proclaimed king as [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]], and a war of independence against Spain was launched.  [[History of Ceuta|Ceuta]] governors did not accept the new king; they maintained their allegiance to Spain.  Although Portugal had substantially attained its independence in 1640, the Spanish continued to try to reassert their control for the next twenty-eight years, only accepting Portuguese independence in 1668.

In the 17th century the Portuguese emigrated in large numbers to Brazil.  By 1709, [[John V of Portugal|John V]] prohibited emigration, since Portugal had lost a sizable fraction of its population.  Brazil was elevated to a vice-kingdom.

== Pombaline era ==
{{Main|Portugal from the Restoration to the 1755 Earthquake|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal}}

[[Image:O marques de pombal, conde de Oeiras.jpg|thumb|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, [[Marquis of Pombal]], [[Count of Oeiras]].]]
In 1738, Sebastião de Melo, the talented son of a Lisbon squire, began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese [[Ambassador]] in [[London]] and later in [[Vienna]]. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state.

By 1755, Sebastião de Melo was made Prime Minister.  Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal.  He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in [[India]]; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christian]] sects in Portugal.

[[Image:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|250px|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]
But Sebastião de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[Lisbon]] was struck by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires. Sebastião de Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: &quot;What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.&quot;

Despite the calamity, Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new downtown of [[Lisbon]] was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions: They represent the world's first quake-proof buildings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.

Following the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebastião de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Tavora affair|Távora family]] and the Duke of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] were implicated  and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebastião de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the Minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.

Following the Távora affair, the new Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] knew no opposition. Made &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot; in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]'s death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal’s &quot;enlightenment,&quot; while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial
economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91–108, 160–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis (See ''[[Távora affair]]''), and forbade him from coming within 20 miles of her, thus curtailing his influence.

=== Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762) ===

{{Main|Spanish Invasion of Portugal (1762)}}
In 1762 France and Spain tried to force Portugal to join the [[Bourbon Family Compact]], by asserting that [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain had become too powerful]]. Joseph refused to accept this and protested that his 1704 alliance with Britain was no threat.

In spring 1762 Spanish troops invaded Portugal from the north as far as the [[Douro]], while a second column [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|captured Almeida]] and threatened to advance on Lisbon. The arrival of a force of British troops helped Portugal, blocking the Spanish advance and driving them back across the border following the [[Battle of Valencia de Alcántara]]. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763 Spain agreed to hand back Almeida to Portugal.

{{Main|History of Portugal (1777-1834)|History of Portugal (1834-1910)}}
In 1807 Portugal refused [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s demand to accede to the [[Continental System]] of embargo against the [[United Kingdom]]; a French invasion under [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]] followed, and Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807.  British intervention in the [[Peninsular War]] restored Portuguese independence, the last French troops being expelled in 1812.  The war cost Portugal the province of [[Olivenza|Olivença]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ertl|first=Alan W.|title=Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Precis of Continental Integration|year=2008|publisher=Dissertation.com|isbn=978-1-59942-983-0|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=province+Oliven%C3%A7a+peninsular+war&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oAaVTOCOIpCQjAe7q_CtBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=province%20Oliven%C3%A7a%20peninsular%20war&amp;f=false|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; now governed by Spain.  [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, was the Portuguese capital between 1808 and 1821.  In 1820 [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto|Oporto]] (24 August) and Lisbon (15 September).  Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence from Portugal in 1822.

The death of [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession.  His eldest son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], but neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Glória]], on the condition that when of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]].  Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the &quot;absolutist&quot; faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel as king in February 1828.  This led to the [[Liberal Wars]] in which Pedro, eventually forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834, and placed his daughter on throne as Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]].

In 1890 the British government made an [[British Ultimatum|ultimatum]] delivered on 11 January 1890, to [[Portugal]], forcing the retreat of Portuguese military forces in the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]). The area had been claimed by Portugal, which had included it in its &quot;[[Pink Map]]&quot;, but this clashed with British aspirations to create a railroad link between [[Cairo]] and [[Cape Town]], thereby linking its colonies from the north of Africa to the very south. This diplomatic clash leading to several waves of protest, prompted the downfall of the Portuguese government. The 1890 British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politics at that time, the most outrageous and infamous action of the British against her oldest ally.&lt;ref&gt;João Ferreira Duarte, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/2000/v13/n1/037395ar.pdf The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The First Republic (1910–1926) ==
{{Main|Portuguese First Republic}}

The First Republic has, over the course of a recent past, lost many historians to the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]].  As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history.  As far as the October 1910 Revolution is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made,&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente’s polemical thesis.  This historian posited the [[Jacobin]] and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Pulido Valente, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime that presented a clear contrast to [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]’s ensuing dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira Marques, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and religious (priests and nuns) were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of a disastrous economic situation. On 10 October&amp;nbsp;– five days after the inauguration of the Republic&amp;nbsp;– the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and all religious orders were to be suppressed. All religious were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship.

A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed; then laws recognizing the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorizing cremation, secularizing cemeteries, suppressing religious teaching in the schools and prohibiting the wearing of the cassock, were passed. In addition, the ringing of church bells and times of worship were subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government even interfered with the seminaries, reserving the right to name the professors and determine the programs. This whole series of laws authored by [[Afonso Costa]] culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.

A republican constitution was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the [[Portuguese Evolutionist Party|Evolutionist party]] and the [[União Republicana|Republican Union]]. In spite of these splits, the PRP, led by [[Afonso Costa]], preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces were forced to resort to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic’s existence, known as the ‘old’ Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted (1997a), as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).

The PRP viewed the outbreak of the [[First World War]] as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the African colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party.&lt;ref&gt;Teixeira, 1996a&lt;/ref&gt; These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by [[Portugal in World War I|Portugal’s intervention in the First World]] War.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro de Meneses, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of consensus around Portugal’s intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General [[Pimenta de Castro]] (January–May 1915) and [[Sidónio Pais]] (December 1917-December 1918).

[[Sidonismo]], also known as ''Dezembrismo'' ([[English language|English]] &quot;Decemberism&quot;), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained.&lt;ref&gt;José Brandão, 1990; Ramalho, 1998; Ribeiro de Meneses, 1998, Armando Silva, 1999; Samara, 2003 and Santos, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; António José Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the [[totalitarian]] and [[fascist]] dictatorships of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Teixeira, 2000, pp. 11-24&lt;/ref&gt; Sidónio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the ''Pátria'' (English: &quot;Homeland&quot;), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion.

A move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the ''Pátria'') through the creation of a [[corporative]] [[Senate]], the founding of a single-party (the [[Partido Nacional Republicano|National Republican Party]]), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the leader. The state carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing [[working-class movements]] and leftist republicans. Sidónio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome some of the rifts of the recent past, making the republic more acceptable to [[monarchists]] and [[Catholics]].

The vacuum of power created by Sidónio Pais’ murder&lt;ref&gt;Medina, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; on 14 December 1918, led the country to a brief [[civil war]]. The monarchy’s restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal (known as the [[Monarchy of the North]]) on 19 January 1919, and four days later a monarchist insurrection broke out in [[Lisbon]]. A republican coalition government, led by [[José Relvas]], coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from [[Porto|Oporto]] on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.

It was during this restoration of the ‘old’ republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative president was elected&amp;nbsp;– [[António José de Almeida]] (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union)&amp;nbsp;– and his office was given the power to dissolve parliament. Relations with the [[Holy See]], restored by Sidónio Pais, were preserved. The president used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a [[Partido Liberal|liberal]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}} government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections.

These were held on 10 July 1921, with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military ''pronunciamento'' was carried out during which&amp;nbsp;– and apparently against the wishes of the coup’s leaders&amp;nbsp;– a number of prominent conservative figures, including [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[António Granjo]], were assassinated. This event, known as the ‘night of blood’&lt;ref&gt;Brandão, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic’s institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.

A new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability: the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition’s attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal factionalism, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, 1994; João Silva, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

This is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926 there were forty-five governments. The opposition of [[List of Presidents of Portugal|presidents]] to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party’s almost non-existent internal discipline, and its desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government’s task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if the PRP wanted to enjoy the fruits of power.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartzman, 1989; Pinto, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 28 May 1926 coup d'état ===

{{Main|28 May 1926 coup d'état}}

[[Image:Desfile de tropas 28 de Maio 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gomes da Costa]] and his troops march victorious into Lisbon on 6 June 1926.]]
By the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition’s constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The political awareness of the armed forces had grown during the war, and many of whose leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending it to a war it did not want to fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 1992a&quot;&gt;Ferreira, 1992a&lt;/ref&gt;

They seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of ‘order’ against the ‘chaos’ that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|''pronunciamento'' of 28 May 1926]] enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 1992a&quot;/&gt;

There are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic’s existence.&lt;ref&gt;Marques, 1973; Telo, 1980 &amp; 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, 1986; Cabral, 1993; Rosas, 1997; Martins, 1998; Pinto, 2000; Afonso, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate. A recent historiographical balance sheet, elaborated by Armando Malheiro da Silva (2000,) is a good introduction into this debate. Three main interpretations can be identified. For some historians the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the 19th century. A third group chooses to highlight the regime’s revolutionary, Jacobin and dictatorial nature.

{{Main|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}
[[Image:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|Portuguese colonies in Africa by the time of the Colonial War.]]
Political chaos, several strikes, harsh relations with the church, and considerable economic problems aggravated by a disastrous [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]] led to the military [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]]. This coup installed the &quot;Second Republic&quot; that would become the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' in 1933, led by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], which transformed Portugal into a proto-Fascist [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]-leaning state. This later evolved into some mixture of single-party [[Corporatism#Fascist corporatism|corporative]] regime.

In 1961 the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony in Goa against an Indian invasion (See [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]). The operations resulted in a humiliating Portuguese defeat and the loss of the colonies in India. Independence movements also became active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]; the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] started. Portugal, during this period, was never an outcast, and was a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).

After the death of Salazar in 1970, his replacement by [[Marcelo Caetano]] offered a certain hope that the regime would open up, the ''primavera marcelista'' (Marcelist spring). However the colonial wars in Africa continued, [[political prisoner]]s remained incarcerated, freedom of association was not restored, [[censorship]] was only slightly eased and the [[election]]s remained tightly controlled.

The regime retained its characteristic traits: censorship, corporativeness, with a market economy dominated by a handful of economical groups, continuous surveillance and intimidation of several sectors of society through the use of a political police and techniques instilling fear (such as arbitrary imprisonment, systematic political persecution and even assassination of anti-regime insurgents).

== The Third Republic (1974–) ==
{{Main|History of Portugal (1974-1986)|History of Portugal (1986-2000)|Portugal in the 2000s}}
The &quot;[[Carnation Revolution]]&quot; of 1974, an effectively bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the &quot;Third Republic&quot;. Broad democratic reforms were implemented.  In 1975, Portugal granted independence to its [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Provinces]] (''Províncias Ultramarinas'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) in [[Africa]] ([[Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Cape Verde]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]).  Nearly 1 million [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] or persons of Portuguese descent left these former colonies as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal - Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same year, [[Indonesia]] invaded and annexed the Portuguese province of [[Portuguese Timor]] (East Timor) in Asia before independence could be granted. The massive exodus of the Portuguese military and citizens from [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], would prompt an era of chaos and severe destruction in those territories after independence from Portugal in 1975. From May 1974 to the end of the 1970s, over a million Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]) left those territories as destitute refugees&amp;nbsp;– the ''retornados''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (August 16, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, July 07, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly-independent countries were ravaged by brutal civil wars in the following decades&amp;nbsp;– the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) and [[Mozambican Civil War]] (1977–1992) - responsible for millions of deaths and refugees. The Asian dependency of [[Macau]], after an agreement in 1986, was returned to [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] sovereignty in 1999. Portugal applied international pressure to secure East Timor's independence from Indonesia, as East Timor was still legally a Portuguese dependency, and recognized as such by the [[United Nations]]. After a referendum in 1999, East Timor voted for independence and Portugal recognized its independence in 2002.

With the 1975–76 independence of its colonies, other than Macau, the 560 year old [[Portuguese Empire]] effectively ended. Simultaneously 15 years of war effort also came to an end; many [[List of Portuguese|Portuguese]] returned from the colonies (the ''retornados'') and came to comprise a sizeable [[Demographics of Portugal#Vital statistics since 1900.5B4.5D.5B5.5D.5B6.5D|number of the population]]: approximately 580,000 of Portugal's 9,8 million citizens in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6i_LwP-YW0oC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=retornados+population+of+portugal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F3li3LecHd&amp;sig=bhvTUvvG_uEOowhaQ-aU5ZmD0sA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EaCFT4yzNOLc0QG6nOzpBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=retornados%20population%20of%20portugal&amp;f=false

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened new paths for the country's future just as others closed. In 1986, Portugal entered the [[European Economic Community]] and left the [[European Free Trade Association]] which was founded by Portugal and its partners in 1960. The country joined the Euro in 1999. The [[Portuguese empire]] ended ''de facto'' in 1999 when Macau was returned to China, and ''de jure'' in 2002 when [[East Timor]] was independent.
