      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35061">{{History of European art music}}
'''Renaissance music''' is music written in Europe during the [[Renaissance]].  Consensus among music historians&amp;nbsp;– with notable dissent&amp;nbsp;– has been to start the era around 1400, with the end of the [[Medieval music|medieval]] era, and to close it around 1600, with the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, therefore commencing the musical Renaissance about a hundred years after the beginning of the Renaissance as understood in other disciplines.  As in the other arts, the music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which define the [[Early Modern]] period:  the rise of [[humanism|humanistic]] thought; the recovery of the literary and artistic heritage of ancient Greece and Rome; increased innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprise; the rise of a [[bourgeois]] class; and the [[Protestant Reformation]].  From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school.

The development of [[printing press|printing]] made distribution of music possible on a wide scale.  Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class.  Dissemination of [[chanson]]s, [[motet]]s, and [[mass (music)|masses]] throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style which culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], and [[William Byrd]].  Relative political stability and prosperity in the [[Low Countries]], along with a flourishing system of music education in the area's many churches and cathedrals, allowed the training of hundreds of singers and composers.  These musicians were highly sought throughout Europe, particularly in Italy, where churches and aristocratic courts hired them as composers and teachers.  By the end of the 16th century, Italy had absorbed the northern influences, with [[Venice]], [[Rome]], and other cities being centers of musical activity, reversing the situation from a hundred years earlier.  [[Opera]] arose at this time in Florence as a deliberate attempt to resurrect the music of ancient Greece.&lt;ref name=refname&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/view/Entry/162352?redirectedFrom=renaissance%20#eid |title=Oxford English Dictionary: the definitive record of the English language, 3rd ed., s.v. “renaissance” }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music, increasingly freed from medieval constraints, in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation, became a vehicle for personal expression.  Composers found ways to make music expressive of the texts they were setting.  Secular music absorbed techniques from sacred music, and vice versa.  Popular secular forms such as the chanson and madrigal spread throughout Europe.  Courts employed virtuoso performers, both singers and instrumentalists.  Music for the first time became self-sufficient, existing for its own sake.  Many familiar modern instruments, including the violin, the guitar, and keyboard instruments, were born during the Renaissance.  During the 15th century the sound of full triads became common, and towards the end of the 16th century the system of [[church mode]]s began to break down entirely, giving way to the [[functional tonality]] which was to dominate western art music for the next three centuries.

From the Renaissance era both secular and sacred music survives in quantity, and both vocal and instrumental.  An enormous diversity of musical styles and genres flourished during the Renaissance, and can be heard on commercial recordings in the 21st century, including masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied songs, instrumental dances, and many others.  Numerous early music ensembles specializing in music of the period give concert tours and make recordings, using a wide range of interpretive styles.

==Overview==
One of the most pronounced features of early Renaissance European art music was the increasing reliance on the [[interval (music)|interval]] of the third (in the [[Middle Ages]], thirds had been considered dissonances). [[Polyphony]] became increasingly elaborate throughout the 14th century, with highly independent voices: the beginning of the 15th century showed simplification, with the voices often striving for smoothness. This was possible because of a greatly increased vocal range in music&amp;nbsp;– in the Middle Ages, the narrow range made necessary frequent crossing of parts, thus requiring a greater contrast between them.

The [[Mode (music)|modal]] (as opposed to [[Tonality|tonal]]) characteristics of Renaissance music began to break down towards the end of the period with the increased use of root motions of fifths. This later developed into one of the defining characteristics of tonality.

The main characteristics of Renaissance music are: &lt;ref name=renaissancecharacteristics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpfuller.com/gcse/music/renaissance.html |title=Renaissance Music (1450&amp;nbsp;– 1600) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Music based on modes.
*Richer texture in four or more parts.
*Blending rather than contrasting strands in the musical texture.
*Harmony with a greater concern with the flow and progression of chords.

Polyphony is one of the notable changes that mark the Renaissance from the Middle Ages musically. &lt;ref name=&quot;renaissanceinstruments&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e5580 |author=Montagu, Jeremy |title=Renaissance instruments In The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use encouraged the use of larger ensembles and demanded sets of instruments that would blend together across the whole vocal range. &lt;ref name=&quot;renaissanceinstruments&quot;/&gt;

===Genres===
Principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]) for their own designs.

Common sacred genres were the [[mass (music)|mass]], the [[motet]], the [[madrigale spirituale]], and the [[laude]].

During the period, secular music had an increasing distribution, with a wide variety of forms, but one must be cautious about assuming an explosion in variety: since [[printing]] made music more widely available, much more has survived from this era than from the preceding Medieval era, and probably a rich store of popular music of the late Middle Ages is irretrievably lost. Secular music included songs for one or many voices, forms such as the [[frottola]], [[chanson]] and [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]].

Secular music was music that was independent of churches. The main type was the German lied, Italian frottola, the French chanson, the Italian madrigal, and the Spanish villancico &lt;ref name=renaissancecharacteristics /&gt; .  Secular vocal genres included the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], the [[frottola]], the [[caccia (music)|caccia]], the [[chanson]] in several forms ([[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]], [[virelai]], [[bergerette]], [[ballade (musical form)|ballade]], [[musique mesurée]]), the [[canzonetta]], the [[villancico]], the [[villanella]], the [[villotta]], and the [[lute song]]. Mixed forms such as the [[motet-chanson]] and the secular motet also appeared.

Purely instrumental music included [[Consort of instruments|consort]] music for [[recorder]] or [[viol]] and other instruments, and dances for various ensembles.
Common genres were the [[toccata]], the [[prelude (music)|prelude]], the [[ricercar]], the [[canzona]], and [[intabulation]] (''intavolatura'', ''intabulierung''). Instrumental ensembles for dances might play a [[basse danse]] (or ''bassedanza''), a [[pavane]], a [[galliard]], an [[allemande]], or a [[courante]].

Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen.

===Theory and notation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Medieval music]] --&gt;
According to Margaret Bent (1998), &quot;Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive by our standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness.&quot;
[[Image:white mensural notation.gif|thumb|250px|Ockeghem, Kyrie &quot;Au travail suis,&quot; excerpt]]
Renaissance compositions were notated only in individual parts; scores were extremely rare, and [[bar (music)|barlines]] were not used. [[Note value]]s were generally larger than are in use today; the primary unit of [[Beat (music)|beat]] was the [[semibreve]], or [[whole note]]. As had been the case since the [[Ars Nova]] (see [[Medieval music]]), there could be either two or three of these for each [[double whole note|breve]] (a double-whole note), which may be looked on as equivalent to the modern &quot;measure,&quot; though it was itself a note value and a measure is not. The situation can be considered this way: it is the same as the rule by which in modern music a quarter-note may equal either two eighth-notes or three, which would be written as a &quot;triplet.&quot; By the same reckoning, there could be two or three of the next smallest note, the &quot;minim,&quot; (equivalent to the modern &quot;half note&quot;) to each semibreve.

These different permutations were called &quot;perfect/imperfect tempus&quot; at the level of the breve–semibreve relationship, &quot;perfect/imperfect prolation&quot; at the level of the semibreve–minim, and existed in all possible combinations with each other. Three-to-one was called &quot;perfect,&quot; and two-to-one &quot;imperfect.&quot; Rules existed also whereby single notes could be halved or doubled in value (&quot;imperfected&quot; or &quot;altered,&quot; respectively) when preceded or followed by other certain notes. Notes with black noteheads (such as [[quarter note]]s) occurred less often. This development of [[white mensural notation]] may be a result of the increased use of [[paper]] (rather than [[vellum]]), as the weaker paper was less able to withstand the scratching required to fill in solid noteheads; notation of previous times, written on vellum, had been black. Other colors, and later, filled-in notes, were used routinely as well, mainly to enforce the aforementioned imperfections or alterations and to call for other temporary rhythmical changes.

Accidentals were not always specified, somewhat as in certain fingering notations ([[tablature]]s) today. However, Renaissance musicians would have been highly trained in [[dyadic counterpoint]] and thus possessed this and other information necessary to read a score, &quot;what modern notation requires [accidentals] would then have been perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint.&quot; See [[musica ficta]]. A singer would interpret his or her part by figuring cadential formulas with other parts in mind, and when singing together musicians would avoid parallel octaves and fifths or alter their cadential parts in light of decisions by other musicians (Bent, 1998).

It is through contemporary tablatures for various plucked instruments that we have gained much information about what accidentals were performed by the original practitioners.

For information on specific theorists, see [[Johannes Tinctoris]], [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], [[Heinrich Glarean]], [[Pietro Aron]], [[Nicola Vicentino]], [[Tomás de Santa María]], [[Gioseffo Zarlino]], [[Vicente Lusitano]], [[Vincenzo Galilei]], [[Giovanni Artusi]], [[Johannes Nucius]], and [[Pietro Cerone]].

===Composers of the Renaissance—timeline===
{{Timeline_Classical_Composers Renaissance}}

==Early Renaissance music (1400–1467)==
This group gradually dropped the late Medieval period's complex devices of [[isorhythm]] and extreme [[syncopation]], resulting in a more limpid and flowing style. What their music &quot;lost&quot; in rhythmic complexity, however, it gained in rhythmic vitality, as a &quot;drive to the cadence&quot; became a prominent feature around mid-century.

==Middle Renaissance music (1467–1534)==
[[Image:DESPREZ.jpg|thumb|right|1611 [[woodcut]] of Josquin des Prez, copied from a now-lost oil painting done during his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Grove, §8.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the early 1470s, music started to be printed using a [[printing press]]. Music printing had a major effect on how music spread for not only did a printed piece of music reach a larger audience than any manuscript ever could, it did it far cheaper as well. Also during this century, a tradition of famous makers began for many instruments. These makers were masters of their craft. An example is Neuschel for his trumpets.

Towards the end of the 15th century, polyphonic sacred music (as exemplified in the masses of [[Johannes Ockeghem]] and [[Jacob Obrecht]]) had once again become more complex, in a manner that can perhaps be seen as correlating to the stunning detail in the painting at the time. Ockeghem, particularly, was fond of [[canon (music)|canon]], both contrapuntal and [[Prolation canon|mensural]]. He composed a mass, ''[[Missa prolationum]]'', in which all the parts are derived canonically from one musical line.

It was in the opening decades of the next century that music felt in a tactus (think of the modern time signature) of two semibreves-to-a-breve began to be as common as that with three semibreves-to-a-breve, as had prevailed prior to that time.

In the early 16th century, there is another trend towards simplification, as can be seen to some degree in the work of [[Josquin des Prez]] and his contemporaries in the [[Franco-Flemish School]], then later in that of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|G. P. Palestrina]], who was partially reacting to the strictures of the [[Council of Trent]], which discouraged excessively complex polyphony as inhibiting understanding the text. Early 16th-century Franco-Flemings moved away from the complex systems of canonic and other mensural play of Ockeghem's generation, tending toward points of imitation and duet or trio sections within an overall texture that grew to five and six voices. They also began, even before the Tridentine reforms, to insert ever-lengthening passages of [[homophony]], to underline important text or points of articulation. Palestrina, on the other hand, came to cultivate a freely flowing style of counterpoint in a thick, rich texture within which consonance followed dissonance on a nearly beat-by-beat basis, and suspensions ruled the day (see [[counterpoint]]). By now, tactus was generally two semibreves per breve with three per breve used for special effects and climactic sections; this was a nearly exact reversal of the prevailing technique a century before.

==Late Renaissance music (1534–1600)==
[[Image:San Marco (evening view).jpg|thumb|300px|left|San Marco in the evening. The spacious, resonant interior was one of the inspirations for the music of the Venetian School.]]
In [[Venice]], from about 1534 until around 1600, an impressive polychoral style developed, which gave Europe some of the grandest, most sonorous music composed up until that time, with multiple choirs of singers, brass and strings in different spatial locations in the Basilica [[San Marco di Venezia]] (see [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]]). These multiple revolutions spread over Europe in the next several decades, beginning in Germany and then moving to Spain, France and England somewhat later, demarcating the beginning of what we now know as the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] musical era.

The [[Roman School]] was a group of composers of predominantly church music in Rome, spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.  While best known as a prolific composer of masses and motets, he was also an important madrigalist.  His ability to bring together the functional needs of the Catholic Church with the prevailing musical styles during the [[Counter-Reformation]] period gave him his enduring fame.&lt;ref name=palestrina&gt;{{cite web |author=Lewis Lockwood, |title=et al. &quot;Palestrina, Giovanni Pierluigi da.&quot; In Grove Music Online. |publisher=Oxford Music Online |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/subscriber/article/grove/music/20749 |accessdate=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief but intense flowering of the musical madrigal in England, mostly from 1588 to 1627, along with the composers who produced them, is known as the [[English Madrigal School]]. The English madrigals were a cappella, predominantly light in style, and generally began as either copies or direct translations of Italian models. Most were for three to six voices.

''[[Musica reservata]]'' is either a style or a performance practice in a cappella vocal music of the latter, mainly in Italy and southern Germany, involving refinement, exclusivity, and intense emotional expression of sung text.

The cultivation of European music in the Americas began in the 16th century soon after the arrival of the Spanish, and the conquest of [[Mexico]]. Although fashioned in European style, uniquely Mexican hybrid works based on native Mexican language and European musical practice, appeared very early. Musical practices in New Spain continually coincided with European tendencies throughout the subsequent Baroque and Classical music periods. Among these New World composers were [[Hernando Franco]], [[Antonio de Salazar (composer)|Antonio de Salazar]], and [[Manuel de Zumaya]].

In addition, many composers observed a division in their own works between a ''[[prima pratica]]'' (music in the Renaissance polyphonic style) and a ''seconda pratica'' (music in the new style) during the first part of the 17th century.

===Masses===
The 15th and 16th century masses had two kinds of sources that were used, monophonic and polyphonic, with two main forms of elaboration, based on cantus firmus practice or, beginning some time around 1500, the new style of pervasive imitation.
Four types of masses resulted:

*Cantus firmus mass (tenor mass)
*The cantus firmus/imitation mass
*The paraphrase mass
*The imitation mass (parody mass)

Masses were normally titled by the source from which they borrowed. Cantus firmus mass uses the same monophonic melody, usually drawn from chant and usually in the tenor and most often in longer note values than the other voices. &lt;ref name=borrowing&gt;{{cite web |author=J. Peter Burkholder. |title=&quot;Borrowing.&quot; In Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford Music Online |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/subscriber/article/grove/music/52918pg5 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mannerism===
In the late 16th century, as the Renaissance era closed, an extremely manneristic style developed. In secular music, especially in the madrigal, there was a trend towards complexity and even extreme chromaticism (as exemplified in [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]], [[Luca Marenzio|Marenzio]], and [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]]). The term &quot;mannerism&quot; derives from art history.

===Transition to the Baroque===
Beginning in [[Florence]], there was an attempt to revive the dramatic and musical forms of Ancient Greece, through the means of [[monody]], a form of declaimed music over a simple accompaniment; a more extreme contrast with the preceding polyphonic style would be hard to find; this was also, at least at the outset, a secular trend. These musicians were known as the [[Florentine Camerata]].

We have already noted some of the musical developments that helped to usher in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], but for further explanation of this transition, see [[antiphon]], [[concertato]], [[monody]], [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], and [[opera]], as well as the works given under &quot;Sources and further reading.&quot;

For a more thorough discussion of the transition to the Baroque specifically pertaining to instrument music, see ''[[Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music]]''.

==Instruments of the Renaissance==
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind.

Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a drone, or occasionally in parts. During the 15th century there was a division of instruments into Haut (loud, outdoor instruments) and Bas (quieter, more intimate instruments) Only two groups of instruments could play freely in both types of ensembles: the Cornett and sackbut and the Tabor and tambourine.&lt;ref name=borrowing /&gt;

Beginning of the 16th century, instruments were considered to be less important then voices. They were used for dances and to accompany vocal music. &lt;ref name=renaissancecharacteristics /&gt;
Instrumental music remained subordinated to vocal music, and much of its repertory was in varying ways derived from or dependent on, vocal models.&lt;ref name=refname /&gt;

===Brass===
Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary. Also the body was an S-shape so it was rather unwieldy, but was suitable for the slow dance music which it was most commonly used for.

*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder (will be mentioned at greater length later on) but blown like a trumpet. It was commonly made in several sizes, the largest was called the serpent. The serpent became practically the only cornetto used by the early 17th century while other ranges were replaced by the violin. It was said to be the closest instrument to the human voice with the ability to use dynamics and expression.

*[[Trumpet]]: Early trumpets had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. They were also made in different sizes. Although commonly depicted being used by angels, their use in churches was limited, a prominent exception being the music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]]. They were most commonly used in the military and for the announcement of royalty. Period trumpets were found to have two rings soldered to them, one near the mouthpiece and another near the bell.

*[[Sackbut]] (sometimes sackbutt or sagbutt): A different name for the trombone,&lt;ref name=&quot;www.sackbut.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = sackbut.com | url = http://www.sackbut.com/ | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 22 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the slide trumpet by the end of the 15th century. Sackbuts were used almost exclusively in church music and faced behind the player.

===Strings===
[[Image:Hurdy-Gurdy.jpg|thumb|right|Hurdy-Gurdy]]
[[Image:ReinassanceLute.jpg|thumb|right|Lute]]

As a family strings were used in many circumstances, both sacred and secular. A few members of this family include:

*[[Viol]]: This instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly has six strings. It was usually played with a bow. It has structural qualities similar to the Spanish [[vihuela]]; its main separating trait is its larger size. This changed the posture of the musician in order to rest it against the floor or between the legs in a manner similar to the cello. Its similarities to the vihuela were sharp waist-cuts, similar frets, a flat back, thin ribs, and identical tuning. This is the predecessor of the modern-day violin, viola, and violoncello (cello).

*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small harp, although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum. Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.

*[[Early Irish harp|Irish Harp]]: Also called the Clàrsach in Scottish Gaelic, or the Cláirseach in Irish, during the Middle Ages it was the most popular instrument of Ireland and Scotland. Due to its significance on Irish history it is seen even on the [[Guinness]] label, and is Ireland's national symbol even to this day. To be played it is usually plucked. Its size can vary greatly from a harp that can be played in one's lap to a full-size harp that is placed on the floor

*[[Hurdy gurdy]]: (Also known as the wheel fiddle), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its &quot;drone strings&quot; which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.

* See main article: [[Lute]].

* See main article: [[Harpsichord]].

* See main article: [[Virginal]].

===Percussion===
Some Renaissance percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine, the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums.

*[[Tambourine]]: In the early ages the tambourine was originally a frame drum without the jingles attached to the side. This instrument soon evolved and took on the name of the timbrel during the medieval crusades, at which time it acquired the jingles. The tambourine was often found with a single skin, as it made it easy for a dancer to play. The skin that surrounds the frame is called the vellum, and produces the beat by striking the surface with the knuckles, fingertips, or hand. It could also be played by shaking the instrument, allowing the tambourine's jingles to &quot;clank&quot; and &quot;jingle&quot;.

*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument often known for its historical purpose for men &quot;serenading&quot; their sweethearts,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} It even went to the extent of being repeatedly banned for its &quot;endangerment on female virtue&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} it is also believed that it was banned because of its construction of silver, and due to the great demand on silver in the 19th Century Austria this was another reason for its outlawing. A steel instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth. The loop at the bent end of the tongue of the instrument is plucked in different scales of vibration creating different tones.

===Woodwinds (aerophones)===
The woodwind instruments (aerophones) produce sound by means of a vibrating column of air within the pipe.  Holes along the pipe allow the player to control the length of the column of air, and hence the pitch.  There are several ways of making the air column vibrate, and these ways define the subcategories of woodwind instruments.  A player may blow across a mouth hole, as in a flute; into a mouthpiece with a single reed, as in a modern-day clarinet or saxophone; or a double reed, as in an oboe or bassoon.  All three of these methods of tone production can be found in Renaissance instruments.

*[[Shawm]]: A typical oriental shawm is keyless and is about a foot long with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were also most commonly made of wood and many of them had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular double reed instrument of the renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.
[[Image:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.

*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.

*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: Believe to have been invented by herdsmen who thought to use a bag made out of sheep or goat skin and would provide air pressure so that when its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.

*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.

*[[Transverse flute]]: The Transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.

*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: The recorder is a common instrument still used today, often taught to children in elementary schools. Rather than a reed it uses a whistler mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

==Conclusion==
The 16th century and early 17th century saw the continual improvement of many types of instruments. Woodwind instrument bores were redesigned to extend their range and improve their tone quality. Viols and violins were provided with sound posts to enhance their sound. The compass of keyboard instruments was widened and new tuning systems were developed.

The Renaissance was, as its name implies, a period of renewal, invention, and rejuvenation of both music and instruments. &lt;ref name=borrowing /&gt;
