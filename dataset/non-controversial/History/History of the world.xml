The '''history of the world''' is the [[history]] of [[human|humanity]] from the earliest times to the present, in all places on [[Earth]], beginning with the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Distinct from the [[history of the Earth|history of Planet Earth]] (which includes early geologic history and pre-human biological eras), world history encompasses the study of written records, from ancient times forward, augmented with knowledge gained from other sources such as [[archaeology]].

(cf., History education in the United States is primarily the study of the written past. Defining history in such a narrow way has important consequences ...)&lt;/ref&gt; begins with the invention of writing.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[David Diringer]] (&quot;Writing&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986 ed., vol. 29, p. 558), &quot;Writing gives permanence to men's knowledge and enables them to communicate over great distances....

Later, during the Neolithic Era, or New Stone Age, came the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] (between 8000 and 5000 BCE) in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where humans first began the systematic [[agriculture|husbandry]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tudge&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Molecular clock|Genetic]] measurements indicate that the ape lineage which would lead to ''Homo sapiens'' diverged from the lineage that would lead to chimpanzees (the closest living relative of modern humans) around five million years ago.&lt;ref name=ChenLi&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen, F.C. &amp; Li, W.H. | year = 2001 | title = Genomic divergences between humans and other hominoids and the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–456 | doi = 10.1086/318206 | pmid = 11170892 | pmc = 1235277}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the [[Australopithecine]] genus, which were likely the first apes to walk upright, eventually gave rise to genus ''Homo''. [[Anatomically modern humans]] arose in Africa about 200,000 years ago, and reached behavioral modernity about 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm|title=Human Evolution by The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|work=Human Origins Initiative|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humans spread rapidly from [[Africa]] into the frost-free zones of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] around 60,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stringer2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|22552077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion of humankind to [[North America]] and [[Oceania]] took place at the climax of the most recent [[Ice Age]], when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable. Yet, humans had colonised nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe by the end of the Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. Other [[hominids]] such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia, but as time progressed, tools became far more refined and complex. At some point, humans began using [[fire]] for [[heat]] and [[cooking]]. They also developed [[language]] in the Palaeolithic period and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living. Early artistic expression can be found in the form of [[cave painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s made from wood and bone. During this period, all humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and were generally [[nomadic]]; this means they hunted and foraged for food, and moved constantly from place to place.

===Rise of civilization===
[[Image:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]]—earliest known writing system]]
The [[Neolithic Revolution]], beginning about 8,000 BCE, saw the development of agriculture, which drastically changed the human lifestyle. Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organised into [[Sovereign state|states]]. Agriculture also created [[food]] surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first [[city|cities]]. These were centres of [[trade]], [[manufacturing]] and [[political power]] with nearly no agricultural production of their own. Cities established a [[symbiosis]] with their surrounding [[countryside]]s, absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;The very word &quot;[[civilization]]&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] ''civilis'', meaning &quot;civil,&quot; related to ''civis'', meaning &quot;citizen,&quot; and ''civitas'', meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;city-state.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Early civilizations arose first in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (3500 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Ascalone, Enrico.

The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These societies developed a number of unifying characteristics, including a central government, a complex economy and social structure, sophisticated language and writing systems, and distinct cultures and religions.  [[Writing]] was another pivotal development in human history, as it made the administration of cities and expression of ideas far easier.

As complex civilizations arose, so did complex [[religion]]s, and the first of their kind apparently originated during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/egyptian_sun_god_ra.htm |title=The Sun God Ra and Ancient Egypt |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/tianshu.html &quot;The Sun God and the Wind Deity at [[Kizil Caves|Kizil]],&quot; by Tianshu Zhu,] in Transoxiana Webfestschrift Series I, ''Webfestschrift Marshak: Ēran ud Anērān'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marija Gimbutas]].

===Cradles of civilization===

{{Main|Bronze Age|Iron Age}}
The [[Bronze Age]] is part of the [[three-age system]] ([[Neolithic|Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]]) that for some parts of the world describes effectively the early history of civilization. During this era the most fertile areas of the world saw [[city state]]s and the first civilizations develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: The [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Indus]] in [[India]], and the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] in [[China]].

[[Sumer]], located in [[Mesopotamia]], is the first known complex civilization, developing the first [[city-state]]s in the 4th millennium BCE. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, [[cuneiform script]], appeared c. 3000 BCE. Cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictography|pictographs]]. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract. Cuneiform texts were written on [[clay tablet]]s, on which [[symbol]]s were drawn with a blunt [[Phragmites|reed]] used as a [[stylus]]. Writing made the administration of a large state far easier.

Transport was facilitated by waterways—by rivers and seas. The [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the juncture of three continents, fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas and inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster.

[[Image:The Wrestler (Olmec) by DeLange.jpg|right|thumb|&quot;[[The Wrestler (sculpture)|The Wrestler]]&quot;, an [[Olmec]] era statuette, 1200 – 800 BCE.]]
These developments led to the rise of [[empire]]s. Such extensive civilizations brought peace and stability over wider areas. The first empire, controlling a large territory and many cities, developed in Egypt with the unification of [[Lower and Upper Egypt]] c. 3100 BCE. Over the next millennia, other river valleys would see monarchical empires rise to power. In the 24th century BCE, the [[Akkadian Empire]] arose in [[Mesopotamia]];&lt;ref&gt;[[H.G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]] (1921), [http://books.google.com/books?id=rTAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a 'The Outline of History: Being A Plain History of Life and Mankind'], New York, Macmillan Company, p.&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt; and c. 2200 BCE the [[Xia Dynasty]] arose in China.

Over the following millennia, civilizations would develop across the world. [[Trade]] would increasingly become a source of power as states with access to important resources or controlling important trade routes would rise to dominance. In c. 2500 BCE, the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] developed in [[Sudan]], south of Egypt. In modern Turkey the [[Hittites]] controlled a large empire and by 1600 BCE, [[Mycenaean Greece]] began to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Chadwick|Chadwick, John]] (1976) ''The Mycenaean World'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29037-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George E. Mylonas|Mylonas, George E.]] (1966), ''Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age'', Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-03523-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In India this era was the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]], which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country.

As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, most indigenous societies in [[the Americas]] remained relatively simple for some time, fragmented into diverse regional cultures. During the [[Formative stage]] in [[Mesoamerica]], (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They include civilizations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Moche]], and [[Ica-Nazca culture|Nazca]]. They developed agriculture as well, growing maize and other crops unique to the Americas, and creating a distinct culture and religion. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected by European contact during the early modern period.

[[Image:Angkor wat temple.jpg|thumb|[[Angkor Wat]] [[temple]], [[Cambodia]], early 12th century]]
Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the so-called &quot;Axial Age&quot; saw a set of transformative religious and philosophical ideas develop, mostly independently, in many different locations. During the 6th century BCE, Chinese [[Confucianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confucianism

(Karl Jaspers' Axial Age theory also includes [[Persia]]n [[Zoroastrianism]] on this list, but other scholars dispute Jaspers' timeline for Zoroastrianism.) In the 5th century BCE [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] made significant advances in the development of [[Ancient Greek philosophy]].

===Regional empires===
{{Main|Civilization|Empire}}
[[Image:Parthenon from west.jpg|thumb|[[Parthenon]] epitomizes sophisticated culture of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].]]
The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains, whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects.

Some areas experienced slow but steady technological advancements, with important developments such as the [[stirrup]] and [[moldboard plow]] arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] area during the [[Hellenistic period]], when hundreds of technologies were invented.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, J. M., &amp; Dinsmoor, W. B. (1984). [http://books.google.com/books?id=7ChJMHxovjUC Ancient Athenian building methods]. Excavations of the Athenian Agora, no. 21.

Phoenix, 16 : Tome supplémentaire. Dordrecht: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt; Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the [[Roman Empire]]'s decline and fall and the ensuing [[early medieval]] period.

The great [[empire]]s depended on [[military]] [[annexation]] of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. (1877). [http://books.google.com/books?id=V2hURbcPp0YC Ancient society]; or, Researches in the lines of human progress from savagery, through barbarism to civilization. New York: H. Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged [[international trade]], most notably the massive trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that had been developed by the time of the [[Hellenistic Age]], and the [[Silk Road]].
[[Image:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]], c. 150 CE]]
The empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the [[peasant]]ry, while land-owning [[magnate]]s increasingly evaded centralised control and its costs. [[Barbarian]] pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. [[China]]'s [[Han Empire]] fell into [[civil war]] in 220 CE, while its [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time.

In the west, the [[ancient Greeks|Greeks]] (and later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]) established their own cultures; whose practices, laws, and customs are considered  the foundation of contemporary [[western culture|western civilization]]. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE, the Romans began expanding their territory through conquest and colonization. By the reign of Emperor [[Augustus]] (late 1st century BCE), Rome controlled all the lands surrounding the Mediterranean. By the reign of Emperor [[Trajan]] (early 2nd century CE), Rome controlled much of the land from [[England]] to [[Mesopotamia]].

In the 3rd century BCE, most of [[South Asia]] was united into the [[Maurya Empire]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and flourished under [[Ashoka the Great]]. From the 3rd century CE, the [[Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age. Empires in Southern India included those of the [[Chalukyas]],the [[Rashtrakutas]], the [[Hoysalas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. [[Science]], [[engineering]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[astronomy]], and [[philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.

Meanwhile, East Asia saw the rise of the Han Dynasty, which was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay on the other side of the Silk Road. While the Romans constructed a vast military of unprecedented power, Han China was developing advanced cartography, shipbuilding, and navigation. The East invented blast furnaces and were capable of creating finely tuned copper instruments. As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced in strides in areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, and technology, among others.

By the 1st century CE the [[Aksumite Empire]] had established itself as a major trading Empire, dominating its neighbours in South Arabia and Kush and controlling the [[Red Sea]] trade. They minted their own currency and carved enormous monolithic stelea such as the [[Obelisk of Axum]] to mark their Emperors graves.

[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.jpg|thumbnail|[[Machu Picchu]]—leading icon of [[Inca]] [[civilization]]]]
From the 4th to 6th centuries, northern [[India]] was ruled by the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]]. In southern India, three prominent [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms emerged: [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola]]s and [[Pandyas]]. The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of [[Hindu]] culture in the 4th and 5th centuries.

Successful regional empires were also established in [[the Americas]] starting from around 2000 BCE. In [[Mesoamerica]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574502/Central_America.html Central America]&quot;. ''[[Encarta|MSN Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006]].'' [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257007771573674 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; vast pre-Columbian societies were being built, the most notable being the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztecs]]. As the [[mother culture]] of the [[Olmecs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authenticmaya.com/olmecs_origins_in_guatemala.htm |title=Olmec Origins in The Southern Pacific Lowlands |publisher=Authenticmaya.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; gradually declined, the great Mayan [[city-state]]s slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout [[Yucatán]] and surrounding areas. The later empire of the [[Aztecs]] was built on neighboring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as the [[Toltec]]s.

In [[South America]], the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of the [[Inca]]. The [[Inca Empire]] of [[Tawantinsuyu]], with its capital at [[Cusco]], spanned the entire [[Andes]] [[Mountain Range]], making it the most extensive Pre-Columbian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trailingincas.info/ History of the Inca Empire] Inca history, society and religion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timespacemap.com/search/eventsearch.htm?_what=%22inca+empire%22&amp;_maptype=1 Map and Timeline] of Inca events&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent [[Inca road system|road system]] and unrivaled [[masonry]].

===Declines and falls===
The great empires of Eurasia were all located on temperate coastal plains. From the [[Central Asian]] steppes, horse-based nomads (Mongols, Turks) dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the [[stirrup]], and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer, made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations.

The Tang Dynasty also splintered, however, and after [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period|half a century of turmoil]] the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] reunified China in 982.

==Middle Ages==
{{Main|Middle Ages}}
The Middle Ages center on the [[Eurasia]]n world and are commonly dated from the [[fall of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century. While the Western Roman Empire fragmented into numerous separate kingdoms, the Eastern Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine, Empire]] survived until late in the Middle Ages. The period also corresponds to the [[Islamic conquests]],&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/donner.html ''The Early Islamic Conquests''] Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent [[Islamic golden age]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://trboard.org/modules/makale/makale.php?id=57 Golden age of Arab and Islamic Culture]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theislamproject.org/education/B04_SpreadofIslam.htm |title=Overview of Muslim History |publisher=The Islam Project |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commencement and expansion of the [[Arab Slave Trade|Arab slave trade]], followed by the [[Mongol invasions]] in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[South Asia]] saw a series of [[middle kingdoms of India]], followed by the establishment of [[Islamic empires in India]]. The [[Mid-Imperial China|Chinese Empire]] experienced the successive [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Dynasties.  Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the [[Silk Road]] through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. While the Middle Ages held sway in Europe, civilizations in the Americas, such as the [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Aztec]], continued to flourish, then ended at different times.

===Islamic growth===
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], founded 670 — oldest [[mosque]] in Muslim West]]
{{Main|Islamic Golden Age}}
Muslims began their expansion in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. They came to conquer most of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe. The knowledge and skills of the ancient Middle East, of Greece and of Persia were learned by Muslims in the Middle Ages. Muslims added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional numbering from India. Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography. Even prior to Islam's presence the city of Mecca had served as a center of trade in Arabia, and Muhammad was a merchant. With the new tradition of the ''[[Hajj]]'', the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a center for exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to the Christians, Indians and Chinese who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their faith to China (resulting in a present-day population of some 37 million Chinese Muslims, mainly ethnic Turkic [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s, whose territory was annexed to China), India, southeast Asia, and the kingdoms of western Africa and returned with new discoveries and inventions.

===Medieval Europe===
Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]] was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and [[barbarian]] invasion, all of which had begun in [[Late Antiquity]]. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In the 7th century, [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], once part of the eastern empire, became part of the [[Caliphate]] after conquest by [[Muhammad]]'s successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break was not as extreme as once put forth by historians, with most of the new kingdoms incorporating as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the [[Franks]], under the [[Carolingian dynasty]], established an empire covering much of western Europe; it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders&amp;nbsp;– the [[Viking]]s, [[Magyars]], and [[Saracen]]s.

[[File:Alcazar05 5-4-04.JPG|thumb|[[Castle]]s like [[Alcázar of Segovia|Segovia Castle]], [[Spain]], were common in [[High Middle Ages]] Europe.]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]], which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as new technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]]&amp;nbsp;– the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labor service to nobles&amp;nbsp;– and [[feudalism]]&amp;nbsp;– a political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and [[manor]]s&amp;nbsp;– were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. The [[Crusades]], which were first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslims]], and succeeded long enough to establish some Christian states in the Near East. Intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]] and the founding of universities,  while the building of [[Gothic cathedrals]] was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] were marked by a number of difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague and war decimated the population of western Europe. The [[Black Death]] alone killed approximately a third of the population between 1347 and 1350. It was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Starting in [[Asia]], the disease reached Mediterranean and western [[Europe]] during the late 1340s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague: The Black Death|publisher=National Geographic|date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and killed tens of millions of Europeans in six years; between a third and a half of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/99/8/497 The Black Death and AIDS: CCR5-{Delta}32 in genetics and history].

===Medieval Sub-Saharan Africa===
[[Image:Ife Kings Head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[bronze]] head, [[Ife]], 11th-14th century]]
{{Main|History of Africa}}
Medieval [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was home to many different civilizations. The [[Aksumite Empire]] declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian allies and its people moved further into the [[Ethiopian highlands]] for protection. They eventually gave way to the [[Zagwe Dynasty]] who are famed for their rock cut architecture at [[Lalibela]]. The Zagwe would then fall to the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors and would rule the country well into the 20th century. In the [[West African]] [[Sahel]] region, many Islamic empires rose, such as the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], the [[Songhai Empire]], and the [[Kanem Empire]]. They controlled the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, salt and slaves.

South of the Sahel civilisations rose in the coastal forests where horses and camels could not survive. These include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city of [[Ife]] (noted for its naturalistic art) and the [[Oyo Empire]], the [[Benin Empire]] of the [[Edo people]] centered in [[Benin city]], the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] [[Kingdom of Nri]] which produced advanced bronze art at [[Igbo Ukwu]], and the [[Akan people|Akan]] who are noted for their intricate architecture.

In what is now modern [[Zimbabwe]] various kingdoms evolved from the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in modern [[South Africa]]. They flourished through trade with the [[Swahili people]] on the [[East Africa]]n coast. They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as [[Great Zimbabwe]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Khami]], capital of [[Kingdom of Butua]] and [[Danamombe]] (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The [[Swahili people]] themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built many port cities such as [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]], and [[Kilwa]], which were known to Chinese sailors under [[Zheng He]] and Islamic geographers.

===The Americas===
This period saw the rise of the [[Mississippian culture]] in the modern [[United States]] c. 800 CE. The [[Aztec]] came to dominate much of [[Mesoamerica]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the [[Inca]] came to dominate the [[Andes]] in the 15th century. In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization fell and the [[Classic Maya collapse]] occurred.

===Southeast Asia===
The beginning of the Middle Ages in [[Southeast Asia]] saw the fall of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] to the [[Chenla Kingdom]], which was then replaced by the [[Khmer Empire]]. The Khmer's capital city [[Angkor]] was the largest city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand temples, the most famous being [[Angkor Wat]]. The [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] kingdoms were major powers of the [[Thai people]] who were influenced by the Khmer. The [[Pagan Kingdom]] also rose to prominence in modern [[Burma]]. It was during this period that [[Islam]] spread to [[Indonesia]].

[[Modern history]] (the &quot;modern period,&quot; the &quot;modern era,&quot; &quot;modern times&quot;) is history of the period following the Middle Ages. &quot;[[Contemporary history]]&quot; encompasses historic events that are immediately relevant to the present (such as [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]). It covers human history from c. 1900 up to the present.

===Early modern period===
{{Main|Early Modern period}}
&quot;[[Early modern period]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Early Modern]],&quot; historically speaking, refers to [[Western Europe]]an history from 1501 (after the widely accepted end of the [[Late Middle Ages]]; the transition period was the 15th century) to either 1750 or c. 1790–1800, by which ever [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is favored by a school of scholars defining the period—which, in many cases of [[periodization]], differs as well within a discipline such as art, philosophy or history.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by historians to refer to the period in [[Western Europe]] and its first [[colony|colonies]] that spans the centuries between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] – roughly 1500 to 1800. The early modern period is characterized by the rise to importance of [[science]] and by increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic [[politics]], and the [[nation state|nation-state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, initially in northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[republic]]s such as [[Genoa]]. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The period includes the late decades of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the peak of European [[witch-hunt]]ing.

This period saw a decline in many African civilizations and an advancement in others. Ethiopia entered the [[Zemene Mesafint]] (Age of Princes) in 1769 when the Emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though it later recovered under Emperor [[Tewodros II]]. The [[Swahili Coast]] declined after coming under Portuguese and Omani contol. The [[Songhai Empire]] fell to the Moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns. The kingdom of Zimbabwe gave way to smaller kingdoms such as Mutapa and Butua. Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period; the [[Oyo Empire]] went through its golden age, as did the [[Benin Empire]]. The [[Ashanti Empire]] rose to power in what is modern day [[Ghana]] in 1670. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] also thrived during this period. [[European exploration of Africa]] reached its zenith at this time.

====Renaissance====
{{main|Renaissance}}
[[Europe]]'s [[Renaissance]], beginning in the 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge. (1918). New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp. Page 539 (cf., The European Renaissance which flourished from the 14th to the 16th century [...])&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of the rediscovery of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] world's scientific contributions, and in the [[economic]] and social rise of Europe. But the Renaissance also engendered a culture of [[curiosity|inquisitiveness]] which ultimately led to [[Humanism]]&lt;ref&gt;Briffault, R. (1919). The making of humanity. London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin ltd. 371 pages (cf. [...] humanism of the Renaissance [...])&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;The freethinker. (1881). London: G.W. Foote. Page 394 (cf., [...] scientific revolution began with the Italian Renaissance about 1500 [...])&lt;/ref&gt; Although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, the Renaissance is perhaps known best for its [[art]]istic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]],  who inspired the term &quot;[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science and Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' Retrieved on May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' Retrieved on May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OrteliusWorldMap.jpeg|thumb|World map by [[Ortelius]], 1570, incorporating new discoveries by Europeans]]
[[Image:Gutenburg bible.jpg|thumb|[[movable type|Movable-type]] [[printing press]] arose in mid-15th century. 50 years later, nine million books were in print.]]
During this period, European powers came to dominate most of the world.  One theory of why that happened holds that Europe's [[geography]] played an important role in its success. The [[Middle East]], [[India]] and [[China]] are all ringed by [[mountain]]s and [[ocean]]s but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several [[sea]]s. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of [[Central Asia]]n invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the [[Eurasia]]n continent and, if they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;Joel L. Kraemer (1992), Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam, p. 1 &amp; 148, Brill Publishers, ISBN 90-04-07259-4.&lt;/ref&gt; was ended by the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic [[invasion]]s, and [[Russia]] spent a couple of centuries under the [[Tatar invasions|Mongol-Tatar]] yoke. [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[western Europe]], logistically more distant from the [[Central Asia]]n heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.

Geography contributed to important [[geopolitical]] differences. For most of their histories, China, India and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Imber, Colin. The Ottoman Empire, 1300–1650: The Structure of Power. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. ISBN 0-333-61386-4.&lt;/ref&gt; controlled almost all the Middle East, the [[Ming Dynasty]] ruled China,&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Walthall, Palais. (2006). East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. ISBN 0-618-13384-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia Buckley. (1999). The Cambridge Illustrated History of China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-66991-X (paperback).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mughal Empire]] held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the [[Roman Empire]], tended to collapse soon after they arose.  Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.

Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their [[Natural environment|environments]]. Productivity remained low, and [[climatic]] changes easily instigated [[boom and bust|boom-and-bust]] [[Business cycle|cycles]] that brought about civilizations' rise and fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history. [[Technological]] advance and the [[wealth]] generated by [[trade]] gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, A. J. (1913).

Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly&amp;nbsp;— given the continent's geography&amp;nbsp;— was largely the work of its Atlantic  states: [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Initially the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s were the predominant conquerors and source of influence, and their union resulted in the [[Iberian Union]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Locke Hart, ''Empires and Colonies'', Cambridge, Polity, 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LnevC1FYdnEC&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[global empire]], on which the &quot;[[The empire on which the sun never sets|sun never set]]&quot;.

In a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating with the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain emerged as the new world power.

This era in European culture saw the [[Age of Enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;The Age of Enlightenment has also been referred to as the [[Age of Reason]]. Historians also include the late 17th century, which is typically known as the Age of Reason or [[Age of Rationalism]], as part of the Enlightenment; however, contemporary historians have considered the Age of Reason distinct to the ideas developed in the Enlightenment. The use of the term here includes both Ages under a single all-inclusive time-frame.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|which led to the Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedgwick1917&quot;&gt;Sedgwick, W.

The Industrial Revolution began in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and used new modes of production&amp;nbsp;— the [[factory]], [[mass production]], and [[mechanisation]]&amp;nbsp;— to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously.  The Age of Enlightenment also led to the beginnings of modern [[democracy]] in the late-18th century [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s.

The 21st century has been marked by [[economic globalization]], with consequent risk to interlinked economies, and by the expansion of communications with [[mobile phone]]s and the [[Internet]].
