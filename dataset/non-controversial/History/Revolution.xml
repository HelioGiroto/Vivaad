{{Revolution sidebar |expanded=none}}

A '''revolution''' (from the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] ''revolutio'', &quot;a turn around&quot;) is a fundamental [[social change|change]] in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time. 
[[Aristotle]] described two types of political revolution:
# Complete change from one constitution to another
# Modification of an existing constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''The Politics'' V, tr. T.A. Sinclair (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1964, 1972), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
Revolutions have occurred through [[human history]] and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating [[ideology]]. Their results include major changes in [[culture]], [[economy]], and [[social institution|socio]]-[[political institution]]s.

Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center around several issues. Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in [[European history]] from a [[psychological]] perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several [[social science]]s, including [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.

==Types==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]] in [[Madrid]]. The development of the [[steam engine]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the world. The steam engine was created to [[pump]] water from [[coal mine]]s, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels.]]

There are many different typologies of revolutions in social science and literature. For example, classical scholar [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] differentiated&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boesche, ''Tocqueville's Road Map: Methodology, Liberalism, Revolution, and Despotism'', Lexington Books, 2006, ISBN 0-7391-1665-7, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fLL6Bil2gtcC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22types+of+revolution%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=hdVQR6TVIpm4pgLFvJ2fBw&amp;sig=ZEc373JU8-9qM9N4BgKjnvvHVD8#PPA86,M1 Google Print, p.86]&lt;/ref&gt; between 1) [[political revolution]]s 2) sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform an entire society and 3) slow but sweeping transformations of the entire society that take several generations to bring about (ex.&lt;!-- &quot;Excluding&quot;? &quot;Exemplified&quot;? &quot;For EXample&quot;? For &quot;for example&quot; it seems better to use &quot;e.g.&quot;. --&gt; [[religion]]). One of several different [[Marxist]] typologies divides revolutions into pre-capitalist, early bourgeois, bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, early proletarian, and socialist revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. Topolski, &quot;Rewolucje w dziejach nowo≈ºytnych i najnowszych (xvii-xx wiek),&quot; Kwartalnik Historyczny, LXXXIII, 1976, 251-67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Tilly]], a modern scholar of revolutions, differentiated&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tilly]], ''''European Revolutions, 1492-1992'', Blackwell Publishing, 1995, ISBN 0-631-19903-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=IJBNvCsXfnIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22types+of+revolution%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=hdVQR6TVIpm4pgLFvJ2fBw&amp;sig=A5SYZlQNKb5RMw9djQSnkmZtTYQ#PPA16,M1 Google Print, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt; between a [[coup]], a top-down seizure of power, a [[civil war]], a revolt and a &quot;great revolution&quot; (revolutions that transform economic and social structures as well as political institutions, such as the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], or [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html Bernard Lewis], &quot;Iran in History&quot;, Moshe Dayan Center, Tel Aviv University&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of revolution, created for other typologies, include the [[social revolution]]s; [[proletarian revolution|proletarian]] or [[communist revolution]]s (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[communism]]); failed or abortive revolutions (revolutions that fail to secure power after temporary victories or large-scale mobilization); or violent vs. [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

The term ''revolution'' has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. Such revolutions are usually recognized as having transformed in [[society]], [[culture]], [[philosophy]] and [[technology]] much more than [[political system]]s; they are often known as [[social revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Irving E. Fang, ''A History of Mass Communication: Six Information Revolutions'', Focal Press, 1997, ISBN 0-240-80254-3, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QaVfg_vdyxsC&amp;dq=communication+technology+changed+business&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p. xv]&lt;/ref&gt; Some can be global, while others are limited to single countries. One of the classic examples of the usage of the word ''revolution'' in such context is the [[industrial revolution]] (note that such revolutions also fit the &quot;slow revolution&quot; definition of Tocqueville).&lt;ref&gt;Warwick E. Murray, Routledge, 2006, ISBN 0-415-31800-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=L-3Vq3aadTYC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22cultural+revolutions%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=ddtQR5aHKovqoQLy7J2UAg&amp;sig=Nrc0rBp_zg_44liln8OLNsUu7UE Google Print, p.226]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and socioeconomic revolutions==
Perhaps most often, the word &quot;revolution&quot; is employed to denote a change in [[social institution|socio]]-[[political institution]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;&gt;[[Jack Goldstone]], &quot;Theories of Revolutions: The Third Generation'', ''[[World Politics]]'' 32, 1980:425-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forantorr&quot;&gt;[[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], &quot;Theories of Revolution Revisited: Toward a Fourth Generation&quot;, ''[[Sociological Theory]]'' 11, 1993:1-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kroeber&quot;&gt;Clifton B. Kroeber, ''Theory and History of Revolution'', [[Journal of World History]] 7.1, 1996: 21-40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Goodwin]] gives two definitions of a revolution. A broad one, where revolution is
{{cquote|any and all instances in which a state or a political [[regime]] is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular [[Social movement|movement]] in an irregular, extraconstitutional and/or violent fashion}}
and a narrow one, in which
{{cquote|revolutions entail not only [[mass mobilization]] and [[regime change]], but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic and/or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for [[State (polity)|state]] [[power (sociology)|power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOWO:9&quot;&gt;Goodwin, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Jack Goldstone]] defines them as
{{cquote|an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and noninstitutionalized actions that undermine authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;&gt;Jack Goldstone, &quot;Towards a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory&quot;, ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' 4, 2001:139-87&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]], [[political science]]s and [[history]]. Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C. Scott|James Scott]], [[Eric Selbin]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Ellen Kay Trimberger]], [[Carlos Vistas]], [[John Walton (sociologist)|John Walton]], [[Timothy Wickham-Crowley]] and [[Eric Wolf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOWO:5&quot;&gt;[[Jeff Goodwin]], ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991.'' Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt; The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]] or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;/&gt;

Second generation theorists sought to develop detailed [[theory|theories]] of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;/&gt;

The works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]] and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g. [[modernization]], [[recession]] or [[discrimination]]), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;/&gt;

The second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;/&gt;

Finally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]] and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ [[force]] in pursuing their goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet3&quot;/&gt;

The second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some [[Social change|change]] results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (ex. a [[war]], a [[riot]], a bad [[harvest]]), now is sufficient ‚Äì however if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution (through [[reform]] or [[Political repression|repression]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt;

Many such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases‚Äîfamous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, like the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789‚Äì1799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution]] (1927‚Äì1949).&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt; In his famous &quot;[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]&quot;, however, the eminent Harvard historian, [[Crane Brinton]], focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[list of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in [[empirical]] verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt;

The criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]] and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous [[elites]] and the impact of interstate [[economic]] and [[military]] competition on domestic [[political change]]. Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as &quot;rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures...accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below&quot;, attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt; 

[[Image:EDSA Revolution pic1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|During the height of the [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines, an estimated one to three million people filled EDSA from Ortigas Avenue all the way to Cubao. The photo above shows the area at the intersection of EDSA and Boni Serrano Avenue, just between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo.]]
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]

From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

Defining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of [[ideology]] and [[culture]] in shaping revolutionary [[mobilization]] and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and [[social movement]]s realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on [[contentious politics]] has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt; Revolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner‚Äôs writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomassen&quot;/&gt; has argued that revolutions can be understood as ‚Äúliminal‚Äù moments: Modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach. This would imply not only a focus on political behaviour ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù, but also to recognize moments where ‚Äúhigh and low‚Äù are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.

While revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[Afghan Civil War|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude [[coup d'√©tat|coups d'√©tats]], [[civil war]]s, [[rebellion|revolts and rebellions]] that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstonet4&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Copernicus]] named his 1543 treatise on the movements of planets around the sun ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' (''On the Revolutions of Celestial Bodies'') and this has come to be the model type of a [[scientific revolution]]. However, ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù is attested by at least 1450 in the sense of representing abrupt change in a [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] vol Q-R p. 617 1979 Sense III states a usage &quot;Alteration, change, mutation&quot; from 1400 but lists it as &quot;rare&quot;. &quot;c. 1450, Lydg 1196 ''Secrees'' of Elementys the Revoluciuons, Chaung of tymes and Complexiouns.&quot; It's clear that the usage had been established by the early 15th century but only came into common use in the late 17th in England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=revolution onlineetymology.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Political usage of the term had been well established by 1688 in the description of the replacement of [[James II of England|James II]] with [[William III of Orange|William III]]. The process was termed ''&quot;[[The Glorious Revolution]]&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''[http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm A Concise History of the Russian Revolution]''&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the sense of social change and the geometric sense as in ''[[Surface of revolution]]'' developed in various European languages from [[Latin]] between the 14th and 17th centuries, the former developing as a metaphor from the latter. ‚ÄúRevolt‚Äù as an event designation appears after the process term and is given a related but distinct and later derivation.
