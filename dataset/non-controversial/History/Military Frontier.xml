The '''Military Frontier''' (also known as '''Military Border''' and '''Military Krajina'''; {{lang-hr|Vojna granica, Vojna krajina}}; {{lang-sl|Vojna krajina}}; {{lang-sr|Vojna granica / Војна граница, Vojna krajina / Војна Крајина}}; {{lang-de|Militärgrenze}}; {{lang-hu|Határőrvidék}}; {{lang-ro|Graniţă militară}}) was a borderland of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] and later the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which acted as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against incursions from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. When created in the 16th century by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], it was divided into two districts each under its own special military administration: the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and the [[Slavonian Military Frontier]]. Both of these, along with all later military districts, were placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp.370-471.&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Frontier was a separate Habsburg administrative unit, directly subordinated to [[Vienna]]. Its territory stretched from central [[Croatia]] in the west to eastern [[Transylvania]] in the east and included parts of present-day [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]].

== History ==

=== Ottoman wars ===

The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] caused the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and subsequently the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to shift towards northwest. Much of the old Croatian territory was either captured by the Ottomans or bordered the new Ottoman domain.

In 1435, in an attempt to strengthen the defences towards the Ottomans and Venice, the king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] founded the so-called ''tabor'', a military encampment, each in Croatia, Slavonia and [[Usora (region)|Usora]]. In 1463, the king [[Matthias Corvinus]] founded the ''[[ban (title)|ban]]ovina'' of [[Jajce]] and [[Srebrenik]], and in 1469 the military captaincy of [[Senj]], modeled after the Ottoman captaincies in the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Province of Bosnia]]. All these actions were intended to provide for better defences, but were ultimately unsuccessful. It did bring forth the [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Pandurs|Pandur]] infantry and the [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Hussar]] cavalry though.

After 1526, the [[Austrian Habsburgs]] were selected by the Croatian Parliament as kings of Croatia, and Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] promised the [[Croatian Parliament]] that he would give them 200 cavalrymen and 200 infantrymen, and that he would pay for another 800 cavalrymen who would be commanded by the Croatians. Soon the [[Habsburg Empire]] founded another captaincy in [[Bihać]]. In the short term, all this was also ineffective, as in 1529 the Ottomans swept through the area, captured [[Buda]] and besieged [[Vienna]], wreaking havoc throughout the Croatian border areas.

In 1553, the borderland was reformed for the first time, under the commander [[Ivan Lenković]]. The frontier was split into the [[Croatian Krajina]] (''Krabatische Gränitz'') and the Upper [[Slavonian Krajina]] (''Windische, Oberslawonische Gränitz''). The border with the Ottoman Empire on the line [[Senj]]-[[Otočac]]-[[Slunj]]-[[Glina, Croatia|Glina]]-[[Hrastovica, Croatia|Hrastovica]]-[[Sisak]]-[[Ivanić]]-[[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]]-[[Đurđevac]]
was fortified with several smaller and larger forts. New captaincies were formed in the larger forts: [[Ogulin]], Hrastovica, [[Žumberak]], [[Koprivnica]], Križevci and Ivanić. Smaller forts were manned by [[Germans|German]] infantry and [[Croats|Croatian]] light infantry. The larger forts were manned by German heavy [[cavalry]] and Croatian light cavalry.

The new military expenditures became a considerable concern, and the Congress of [[Inner Austria]]n lands in [[Bruck an der Mur]] in 1578 defined the obligations of each land in covering the military expenses and defined the priorities in improving the defensive strategy. The [[nobility]] of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] financed the Upper Slavonian Frontier while the others ([[Lower Austria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Carniola]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg]]) financed the Croatian Frontier.

By the end of the 16th century, the [[Croatian Krajina]] became known as the [[Karlovac]] ''generalat'', and since the 1630s the Upper [[Slavonian Krajina]] was known as the [[Varaždin]] ''generalat''. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the military administration of the Frontier was moved away from the Croatian [[ban (title)|ban]] and the [[Sabor]] (Parliament) and instead instated in the high command of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] and the War Council in [[Graz]].

Despite the financial support of the Inner Austrian nobility, the financing of the Military Frontier was not efficient enough. The military leadership in Graz decided to try solutions other than mercenary units. In the 1630s, the Imperial Court decided to give land and certain privileges to immigrants into the Frontier (the [[uskok]] guerrillas as well as refugees from Ottoman-controlled lands) at the area of [[Žumberak]], and in return they would serve in the Imperial army. The remaining local population was also encouraged to remain by receiving the status of free peasants (rather than [[serf]]s) and other privileges. These new units were organized into ten or more ''[[voivodeship]]s'' per each captaincy.

In November 1630, the Emperor proclaimed the so-called ''[[Statuta Wallachorum]]'' or [[Vlach Statute]] [http://www.skdprosvjeta.com/page.php?id=33], which regulated the status of so-called Vlach settlers (which included [[Croats]], [[Serbs]] and [[Vlachs]]) from the Ottoman Empire with regard to military command, their obligations and rights to internal self-administration. Over time, the population of the Frontier (as it was then) became mixed between the autochthonous [[Croats]] and Croatian serfs who had fled the Ottoman territories, and the numerous minority of [[Serbs|Serb]] and [[Vlachs|Vlach]] (who were later assimilated into [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]]) refugees who strove to expand their rights as a major contributor in the defense of the land. By creating the new military class in the Frontier, the territory of the Frontier eventually became fully detached from the Croatian Parliament and the [[ban (title)|ban]]. The Territory of the Frontier had a large Serb population, who fled from their south-eastern lands, and tried to fight the Ottoman forces, making a refuge in Habsburg Croatia. As freedom of faith was granted to them, the Orthodox faith was preserved in spite of their living in a Catholic country. Eventually, the whole population of the Military Frontier became professional soldiers that served an Empire on several fronts and through many European wars, even after the disappearance of Ottoman threat.

In 1673, the first detailed map of the Military Frontier was released, where the [[funfair]] and the [[Public bathing|public bath]] for [[border guard]] officers and other gentlemen from the neighborhood in [[Miholjanec]] was marked.&lt;ref&gt;Geoadria, Year: 2001, Volume: 6, Issue: 1, Pages/record No.: 81-91, Hrvatsko geografsko društvo - Zadar, Odjel za geografiju, Sveučilište u Zadru, 2001., {{ISSN|1331-2294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wives and children lived together in organized agricultural cooperatives.

=== After the Great Turkish War and Treaty of Karlowitz ===

The 17th century was a relatively peaceful period, during which only smaller raids were made from the [[Eyalet of Bosnia|Province of Bosnia]]. After the Ottoman army was repelled at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the [[Great Turkish War]] ended with much of the former Croatian lands under Habsburg control. Despite this, the Frontier system was retained, and expanded onto former Ottoman territories in [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banija]], lower [[Slavonia]], [[Srem (region)|Syrmia]], [[Bačka]], [[Banat]], [[Pomorišje]], and [[Transylvania]]. The Empire valued the ability to centrally control the area and draft cheap and numerous army units.

[[File:Militargrenze, Wojwodowena und Banat.jpg|400px|thumb|center|Map of the Military Frontier in the middle of the 19th century (marked with a red outline)]]

After the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, a unit called the ''Serežan'' troop was formed, and it had both military and police duties. The members were not paid, but were released of all taxes. As an irregular unit, they wore a folk uniform rather than an army one. Over the following century, each regiment had one section of the ''serežani'', led by a ''oberbaša'' or ''harambaša'' (sergeant), several ''unterbaša'' (corporal) and ''vicebaša'' (lance corporal). They organized the border patrols towards Bosnia, particularly on difficult terrain, and stopped incursions of bandits. They had to have extensive knowledge of the territory, good marksmanship and to be constantly under arms. They also maintained public law and order in the area of their regiment. There were also cavalry serežan units that served as escort to the high officers of Frontier regiments, carried urgent orders and carried out special patrol duties.

From 1718 to 1739, Military Frontier also included Habsburg-controlled northern parts of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Cz7pbGvCqhwC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=%22kingdom+of+serbia%22+1718&amp;hl=sr&amp;ei=-Qh6TrXKOsKk4ATTnpyrDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=%22attached%20to%20Vojna%20Krajina%22&amp;f=false Empires and Peninsulas: Southeastern Europe Between Carlowitz and the Peace of Adrianople, 1699-1829, Plamen Mitev, Plamen Mitev, Ivan Parvev, Maria Baramova, Vania Racheva, LIT Verlag Münster, 2011, page 171.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-18th century, the Frontier was once again reorganized and modelled after the Imperial army and its regular regiments. In 1737, the Vlach Statute was formally abolished. All previous captaincies and voivodships were discarded, and the area was instead subdivided into general-commands, regiments and companies:
[[File:Kaiserliches Infanterieregiment No. 60 Albertina-Handschrift 1762.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kaiserliches Infanterieregiment No. 60 Albertina-Handschrift 1762]]
* [[Varaždin]] general command
** [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]] regiment
** [[Đurđevac]] regiment
* [[Karlovac]] general command
** [[Lika]] regiment
** [[Otočac]] regiment
** [[Ogulin]] regiment
** [[Slunj]] regiment

** [[Slavonski Brod|Brod]] regiment
** [[Petrovaradin]] regiment
* [[Banat]] general command
** Serb (Illyrian) section
** German section
** Romanian (Vlach) section

After 1767, every twelfth inhabitant of the Military Frontier was a soldier, while in the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy only every 62nd inhabitant was one. The Frontier soldiers became professional military, ready to move to all European battlefields. Due to further immigration of refugees from the Ottoman domain, and the expansion of the territory to places previously controlled by the Ottomans, the population of the Frontier became even more mixed. There were still many autochthonous Serbs and Croats in Slavonia and parts of present-day Vojvodina (in Syrmia, Bačka and Banat). However, at this time they became outnumbered by the Serb, Croat and Vlach refugees/immigrants. Some [[Ethnic German|Germans]] and [[Magyars]] also came to the Frontier, mostly as administrative personnel, and there was a number of other settlers and military persons from other parts of the Habsburg Empire such as the [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]] and others.

In 1787, the civil administration was separated from the military, but this was reversed in 1800. By the Basic Law of the Frontier from 1850, the administration of Military Frontier was split and the land started to look like a state. The Main Command was headquartered in [[Zagreb]], but still directly subordinate to the Ministry of War in Vienna.

===Abolishment of the frontier===
The Croatian Parliament made numerous pleas to demilitarize the Frontier after the Turkish wars subsided. The demilitarization began in 1869 and on August 8, 1873, under [[Franz Joseph]], the [[Banat Krajina|Banatian Frontier]] was abolished and incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], while part of [[Croatian Krajina|Croatian Frontier]] (Križevci and Đurđevac regiments) was incorporated into [[Croatia-Slavonia]]. The decree in which the rest of [[Croatian Krajina|Croatian]] and [[Slavonian Krajina|Slavonian]] Frontiers were incorporated into Croatian-Slavonian crownland was proclaimed on July 15, 1881, while incorporation was performed in 1882.

== Divisions ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the frontier was divided into the several districts:

=== Danube Military Frontier ===

This section of the Military Frontier existed in the first half of the 18th century and comprised parts of southern [[Bačka]] (including [[Bačka Palanka|Palanka]], [[Bački Petrovac|Petrovac]], [[Novi Sad|Petrovaradinski Šanac]], [[Titel]], etc.) and northern [[Syrmia]] (including [[Petrovaradin]], [[Šid]], etc.). After the abolishment of this section of the Frontier, one part of its territory was placed under civil administration and another part was joined to other sections of the Frontier.

=== Tisa Military Frontier ===

This section of the Military Frontier existed between 1702 and 1751 and comprised parts of north-eastern [[Bačka]] (including [[Sombor]], [[Subotica]], [[Kanjiža]], [[Senta]], [[Bečej]], etc.). After the abolishment of this section of the Frontier, most of its territory was placed under civil administration, while one small area in the south remained under military administration as part of the [[Šajkaška|Šajkaš Battalion]].

=== Mureş Military Frontier ===

This section of the Military Frontier existed between 1702 and 1751 and comprised the region of [[Pomorišje]] (area on the northern bank of the river Mureş). After the abolishment of this section of the Frontier, its entire territory was placed under civil administration.

=== Sava Military Frontier ===

It existed in the first half of the 18th century along the Sava river.

=== Banat Military Frontier ===

The [[Banat Krajina]] was located on the [[Serbia]]n-[[Romania]]n border. It was divided into [[Serbs|Serbian]] (''Illyrian''), [[Germans|German]] (''Volksdeutscher'') and [[Romanians|Romanian]] (''Vlach'') sections.

=== Slavonian Military Frontier ===
[[File:Srbin vojnik srem 1742.jpg|thumb|200px|Serb frontiersman in Syrmia in 1742]]
The [[Slavonian Krajina]] was located along [[Posavina]], from eastern [[Croatia]], following the river [[Sava]], along the border with [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]], and stretched into [[Syrmia]], until inflow into Danube near [[Zemun]] (today part of [[Belgrade]]). Its north-eastern border followed the [[Danube]] up until the [[Petrovaradin]].

=== Croatian Military Frontier ===

The [[Croatian Military Frontier]] or &quot;Banska krajina&quot; was located on the border of Croatia and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].

This part of the Military Frontier included the geographic regions of [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] (named after &quot;Banska krajina&quot;), and bordered the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west, [[Venetian Republic]] to the south, Habsburg Croatia to the west, and the Ottoman Empire to the east.

It extended onto the Slavonian Krajina near the confluence of the rivers [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sava]].

=== Šajkaš Battalion ===

The [[Šajkaška|Šajkaš Battalion]] was a small part of the Frontier that was formed in 1763 from parts of the previously abolished Danube and Tisa sections of the frontier. In 1852, Šajkaš battalion was transformed into Titel infantry battalion. It was abolished in 1873, and its territory was incorporated into Bačka-Bodrog County.

=== Transylvanian Military Frontier ===

[[Transylvanian Military Frontier]] existed from 1762 to 1851, mostly in eastern and southern parts of [[Transylvania]]. It was composed of two [[Székely]] and two [[Romanians|Romanian]] regiments. The establishment of the frontier was followed by the ''[[Mádéfalva]] Massacre'' or [[Siculicidium]].

== Legacy ==

After the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia declared independence (in 1991), the Serbs who lived in the region of former Military Frontier (Vojna Krajina) adopted that name (Krajina) in the name of the ''[[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]''. However, this Serb entity also included some territories that were not part of the Military Frontier in the past, while large tracts of territory that had constituted the Military Frontier resided outside the Serb region as largely [[Croat]] populated areas of the [[Republic of Croatia]] (See the [[Croatian War of Independence]] for more information).
