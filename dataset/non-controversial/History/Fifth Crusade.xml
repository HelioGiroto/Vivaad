{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
The '''Fifth Crusade''' (1213&amp;ndash;1221) was an attempt to reacquire [[Jerusalem]] and the rest of the [[Holy Land]] by first conquering the powerful [[Ayyubid]] state in  [[Egypt]].

[[Pope Innocent III]] and his successor [[Pope Honorius III]] organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and Duke [[Leopold VI of Austria]], and a foray against [[Jerusalem]] ultimately left the city in Muslim hands.  Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Cologne, and a mixed army of [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm|Sultanate of Rûm]] which attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.

After occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221, but were turned back after their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat.  A nighttime attack by Sultan [[Al-Kamil]] resulted in a great number of crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.  Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe.

==Preparations==
[[Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade in order to destroy the [[Ayyubids|Ayyubid Empire]] and to recapture Jerusalem. On April, 1213, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued the [[papal bull]] ''Quia maior'', calling all of [[Christendom]] to join a new [[crusade]]. This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.&lt;ref name=&quot;cf&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0-674-02387-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The message of the crusade was preached in [[France]] by [[Robert of Courçon]]; however, unlike other Crusades, not many French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.

In 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, in order to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the [[crusaders]] to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.

===Hungary and Germany===
[[Oliver of Cologne]] had preached the crusade in [[Germany]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent, however, died in 1216. He was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by king [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and duke [[Leopold VI of Austria]].

==Campaign==

===Jerusalem===
Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split (city)|Spalato]]. They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubid]]s in [[Syria]].

In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city,  if they did manage reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099.

Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at Bethsaida on the [[Jordan River]] on November 10. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. The catapults and trebuchets did not arrive in time, so he had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 King Andrew II, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;(Jean Richard: The crusades, c 1071-c. 1291) page: 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.

===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===
Later in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Keykavus I]], the leader in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.

===Egypt===
[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|180px|right| King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]
In June 1218 the crusaders began their [[siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Courcon]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this Count William I of Holland left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.

Immediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220 . Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned, and the crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221 . This march was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to [[Damietta]].

By now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other Ayyubids in Syria, who had defeated Keykavus I. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the [[river]] [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance.  A dry canal that was previously crossed by the crusaders flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat.  With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a night time attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.

==Aftermath==
The terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the true cross. However, the cross was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.

The failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming the Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the &quot;foolishness&quot; of the wicked.
