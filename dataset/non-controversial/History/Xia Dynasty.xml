{{History of China|BC=1}}
{{chinese|c=夏朝|p=Xià Cháo|w=Hsia-Ch'ao|wuu=ya zau|j=haa&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;ciu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}
The '''Xia Dynasty''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|夏|朝}} |p=Xià Cháo |w=Hsia-Ch'ao}}; {{IPA-cmn|ɕiâ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ̯|IPA}}; c. 2070 – c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty in [[China]] to be described in ancient historical chronicles such as ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', ''[[Classic of History]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''. The dynasty was established by the legendary [[Yu the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;Mungello, David E. ''The Great Encounter of China and the West, 1500–1800'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield; 3 edition (28 March 2009) ISBN 978-0-7425-5798-7 p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]], the last of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]] gave his throne to him. The Xia was later succeeded by the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC).

According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by [[Liu Xin]], the Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BCE; according to the chronology based upon the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC. The [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BCE. The tradition of tracing Chinese political history from heroic early emperors to the Xia to succeeding dynasties comes from the idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], in which only one legitimate dynasty can exist at any given time, and was promoted by the [[Confucian]] school in the Eastern Zhou period, later becoming the basic position of [[Chinese historiography|imperial historiography]] and ideology. Although the Xia is an important element in early Chinese history, reliable information on the history of China before 13th century BC can only come from archaeological evidence since China's first established written system on a durable medium, the [[oracle bone script]], did not exist until then.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, Robert.  &quot;Shang Archaeology.&quot;  in ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China''. Michael Loewe and Edward Shaughnessy, ed.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the concrete existence of the Xia is yet to be proven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link Xia with Bronze Age [[Erlitou]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, L. &amp; Xiu, H., &quot;Rethinking Erlitou: legend, history and Chinese archaeology&quot;, ''Antiquity'', 81:314 (2007) pp. 886–901.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional history==
The Xia Dynasty was described in classic texts such as the ''[[Classic of History]]'' (''Shujing''), the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', and the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji'') by [[Sima Qian]].  It has been documented that the tribe that founded the dynasty was the [[Huaxia]], who were the ancestral people of the [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cioffi-Revilla | first=Claudio | year=1995 | title=War and Politics in Ancient China, 2700 B.C.E. to 722 B.C.E. | journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution | volume=39 | issue=3 | pages=471–472 | coauthor=Lai, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lung | first=Rachel | title=Interpreters in early imperial China | year=2011 | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | location=Amsterdam | page=5 | isbn=978-90-272-2444-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and early development===
According to ancient Chinese texts, before the Xia Dynasty was established, battles were frequent between the Xia tribe and [[Chi You|Chi You's]] tribe. The Xia tribe slowly developed around the time of [[Zhuanxu]], one of the legendary [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Emperors]]. The [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and the [[Classic of Rites]] say that [[Yu the Great]] is the grandson of Zhuanxu, but there are also other records, like [[Ban Gu]], that say Yu is the fifth generation of Zhuanxu. Based on this, it is possible that the people of the Xia clan are descendants of Zhuanxu.

===Gun's attempt to stop the flood===
{{See also|Great Flood (China)}}
[[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]], the father of Yu the Great, is the earliest recorded member of the Xia clan. When the [[Yellow River]] flooded, many tribes united together to control and stop the flooding. Gun was appointed by [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] to stop the flooding. He ordered the construction of large blockades to block the path of the water. The attempt of Gun to stop the flooding lasted for nine years but it was a failure because the floods became stronger. After nine years, Yao had already given his throne to [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]]. Gun was ordered to be executed by Shun at Yushan (Chinese: 羽山), a mountain located between modern [[Donghai County]] in [[Jiangsu Province]] and [[Linshu County]] in [[Shandong Province]].

===Yu the Great's attempt to stop the floods===
Yu was highly trusted by Shun. So Shun appointed him to finish his father’s work which was to make the flooding stop.  Yu’s method was different from his father’s; he united all the people of every tribe and ordered them to help him build canals in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead it out to the sea. He did this for 13 years, without going back to his home village. Legend says in those 13 years, he passed by his house three times without going in, which is a sign of his perseverance in his work. The people who noticed him praised his perseverance and were so inspired by him that other tribes joined in his work as well.  In the end, after 13 years, he was successful in stopping the floods and was greatly praised by his people.

===Establishment===
Yu was successful in stopping the flooding and increased the produce from farming (since the floods usually destroyed the crops), the Xia tribe’s influence strengthened and Yu became the leader of the surrounding tribes. Soon afterwards [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] sent Yu to lead an army to suppress the Sanmiao tribe who continuously abused the boundary tribes. After defeating them, he exiled them south to the Han River area. This victory strengthened the Xia tribe’s power even more. Shun, since he was getting old, started to think of a successor. Shun abdicated the throne in favor of [[Yu the Great|Yu]], whom he deemed worthy. This succession of Yu as the king is the start of the Xia Dynasty.
Soon before his death, instead of passing power to the person deemed most capable to rule, Yu's power passed  to his son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], setting the precedence for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia Dynasty began a period of family or clan control.

[[Jie of Xia|Jie]], the last ruler, was said to be a corrupt king. He was overthrown by [[Tang of Shang|Tang]], the first king of the [[Shang dynasty]].

===Qi state===
After the defeat of Xia by [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], the imperial descendants scattered and were absorbed by the nearby clans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://zonghe.17xie.com/book/10826459/597233.html 夏朝遗民流布情况概说]&lt;/ref&gt; and some members of the royal family of Xia Dynasty survived as the [[Qi (Henan)]] state until 445 BC.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Qi state was well recorded in the [[Oracle script]] as the one major supporter of the Xia Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HBSS200503017.htm 夏代是杜撰的吗——与陈淳先生商榷
沈长云&lt;/ref&gt; The Kings of the state of [[Yue (state)|Yue]], and therefore its successor state [[Minyue]], also claimed to be descended from [[Yu the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/History1766bye3553.html The State of Yue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern skepticism==
The [[yigupai|Skeptical School]] of early Chinese history, started by [[Gu Jiegang]] in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to seriously question the traditional story of its early history: &quot;the later the time, the longer the legendary period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2002&quot;&gt;Yun Kuen Lee, &quot;Building the Chronology of Early Chinese History&quot;. ''Asian Perspectives: the Journal of Archaeology for Asia and the Pacific'', Vol. 41, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yun Kuen Lee's criticism of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological versus historical research, in particular the claim that the archaeological [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou Culture]] is also the historical Xia Dynasty. &quot;How to fuse the archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological studies of early civilization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2002&quot; /&gt;

In ''The Shape of the Turtle:  Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China'', [[Sarah Allan]] noted that many aspects of the Xia are simply the opposite of traits held to be emblematic of the [[Shang dynasty]].  The implied dualism between the Shang and Xia, Allan argues, is that while the Shang represent fire or the sun, birds and the east, the Xia represent the west and water.  The development of this mythical Xia, Allan argues, is a necessary act on the part of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], who justify their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the Xia.

==Archaeological discoveries==
{{See also|Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project}}

Archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not the [[Erlitou culture]] was the site of the Xia dynasty. [[Radiocarbon dating]] places the site at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia Dynasty as described in Chinese historical works.&lt;ref&gt;[[John K. Fairbank|Fairbank, John K.]] ''China: A New History''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, a site located in the city of [[Yanshi]] was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have attributed to [[Historical capitals of China|capital of the Xia Dynasty]].  Through the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;&lt;ref name=library/&gt; at a minimum, the Xia Dynasty marked an evolutionary stage between the late [[neolithic]] cultures and the typical Chinese urban civilization of the [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+cn0013%29|title=China – the ancient dynasties|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in 2011, Chinese archaeologists have uncovered the remains of an imperial sized palace—dated to about 1700 BC—at [[Erlitou]] in [[Henan]], lending further questions to the existence of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China finds 3,600-year-old palace | url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/7675375.html | publisher=People's Daily Online | date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sovereigns of the Xia Dynasty==
The following table lists the rulers of Xia according to Sima Qian's ''[[Shiji]]''.
Unlike Sima Qian's list of [[Shang Dynasty]] kings, which is closely matched by [[oracle bones]] from late in that period, records of Xia rulers have not yet been found in archeological excavations.
