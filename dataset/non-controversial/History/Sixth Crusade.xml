The '''Sixth Crusade''' started in 1228 as an attempt to regain [[Jerusalem]]. It began seven years after the failure of the [[Fifth Crusade]]. It involved very little actual fighting. The diplomatic maneuvering of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] resulted in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] regaining control of Jerusalem and other areas for fifteen years.

==Frederick II and the Papacy==
[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], had involved himself broadly in the [[Fifth Crusade]], sending troops from Germany, but he failed to accompany the army directly, despite the encouragement of Honorius III and later Gregory IX, as he needed to consolidate his position in Germany and Italy before embarking on a [[crusade]]. However, Frederick again promised to go on a crusade after his coronation as emperor in 1220 by [[Pope Honorius III]].

In 1225 Frederick married [[Yolande of Jerusalem]] (also known as Isabella), daughter of [[John of Brienne]] (nominal ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]) and [[Maria of Montferrat]]. Frederick now had a claim to the truncated kingdom, and reason to attempt to restore it. In 1227, after [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] became [[pope]], Frederick and his army set sail from [[Brindisi]], [[Italy]], for [[Akko|Acre]] (then the capital of the truncated Kingdom of Jerusalem), but an epidemic forced Frederick to return to [[Italy]]. Gregory took this opportunity to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] Frederick for breaking his crusader vow, though this was just an excuse, as Frederick had for years been trying to consolidate imperial power in Italy at the expense of the [[papacy]]. 

Gregory stated that the reason for the excommunication was Frederick's reluctance to go on crusade, dating back to the Fifth Crusade.  Frederick attempted to negotiate with the pope, but eventually decided to ignore him, and sailed to [[Syria]] in 1228 despite the excommunication, arriving at Acre in September.

==The Crusade==
Instead of heading straight for the [[Holy Land]], Frederick first sailed to [[Cyprus]], which had been an imperial fiefdom since its capture by [[Richard the Lionheart]] on his way to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] during the [[Third Crusade]]. The emperor arrived with the clear intent of stamping his authority on the kingdom, but was treated cordially by the native barons until a dispute arose between him and the constable of Cyprus, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]]. Frederick claimed that his regency was illegitimate and demanded the surrender of John's mainland fief of [[Beirut]] to the imperial throne. Here he erred, for John pointed out that the kingdoms of Cyprus and Jerusalem were constitutionally separate and he could not be punished for offences in Cyprus by seizure of Beirut. This would have important consequences for the crusade, as it alienated the powerful [[Ibelin]] faction, turning them against the emperor.

Acre, as the nominal capital of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the seat of the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchate]], was split in its support for Frederick. Frederick's own army and the [[Teutonic Knights]] supported him, but Patriarch [[Gerald of Lausanne]] (and the clergy) followed the hostile papal line. Once news of Frederick's excommunication had spread, public support for him waned considerably. The position of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Knights Templar]] is more complicated; though they refused to join the emperor's army directly, they supported the crusade once Frederick agreed to have his name removed from official orders. The native barons greeted Frederick enthusiastically at first, but were wary of the emperor's history of centralization and his desire to impose imperial authority. This was largely due to Frederick's treatment of John of Ibelin in Cyprus, and his apparent disdain for the constitutional concerns of the barons.

Even with the military orders on board, Frederick's force was a mere shadow of the army that had amassed when the crusade had originally been called. He realised that his only hope of success in the Holy Land was to negotiate for the surrender of Jerusalem as he lacked the manpower to engage the [[Ayyubid]] empire in battle. Frederick hoped that a token show of force, a threatening march down the coast, would be enough to convince [[al-Kamil]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]], to honor a proposed agreement that had been negotiated some years earlier, prior to the death of [[Al-Mu'azzam|al-Muazzam]], the governor of [[Damascus]]. The Egyptian sultan, occupied with the suppression of rebellious forces in Syria, agreed to cede Jerusalem to the [[Franks]], along with a narrow corridor to the coast. 

In addition, Frederick received [[Nazareth]], [[Sidon]], [[Jaffa]] and [[Bethlehem]]. Other lordships may have been returned to [[Christian]] control, but sources disagree. It was, however, a treaty of compromise. The [[Muslims]] retained control over the [[Temple Mount]] area of Jerusalem, the [[al-Aqsa]] mosque and [[Dome of the Rock]]. The [[Transjordan]] castles stayed in Ayyubid hands, and Arab sources suggest that Frederick was not permitted to restore Jerusalem's fortifications. The treaty, completed on February 18, 1229, safeguarded a truce of ten years.

Frederick entered Jerusalem on 17 March 1229, and attended a crown-wearing ceremony the following day. It is unknown whether he intended this to be interpreted as his official coronation as King of Jerusalem; in any case the absence of the patriarch, Gerald, rendered it questionable. There is evidence to suggest that the crown Frederick wore was actually the imperial one,&lt;ref&gt;''Crusading and the Crusader States'', Jotischky, (Edinburgh, 2004), 225.&lt;/ref&gt; but in any case proclaiming his lordship over Jerusalem was a provocative act. Legally, he was actually only regent for his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad II of Jerusalem]], only child of Yolande and the grandson of Maria of Montferrat and John of Brienne, who had been born shortly before Frederick left in 1228.

==Legacy and precedent==
As Frederick had matters to attend to at home, he left Jerusalem in May. It took a defeat in battle later in 1229 for the Pope to lift the excommunication, but by now Frederick had demonstrated that a crusade could be successful even without military superiority or papal support. The truce, hugely unpopular from its inception, expired in 1239; and Jerusalem was taken following a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1244)|siege]] by the [[Khwarezm|Khwarezmian Turks]] in 1244.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-242895 Jerusalem (Israel) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick had set a precedent, in having achieved success on crusade without papal involvement.  Further crusades would be launched by individual kings, such as [[Louis IX of France]] (the [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Crusade]]s) and [[Edward I of England]] (the [[Ninth Crusade]]), effectively demonstrating an erosion of papal authority.

[[Cecelia Holland]]'s novel ''Antichrist'' presents a heavily fictionalized account of the Sixth Crusade from [[Frederick II]]'s perspective.
