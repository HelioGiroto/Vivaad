The '''Restoration''' was the name given to the period that began on 29 December 1874 after the [[First Spanish Republic]] ended with the restoration of the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]] under [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] after a [[coup d'état]] by [[Arsenio Martinez Campos|Martinez Campos]], and ended on 14 April 1931 with the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].

After almost a whole century of political instability and many civil wars, the aim of the Restoration was to create a new political system, which ensured stability by the practice of ''turnismo''. This was the deliberate rotation of the Liberal and Conservative parties in the government, so no sector of the bourgeoisie felt isolated, and excluded all other parties from the system. This was achieved by [[electoral fraud]]. Opposition to the system came from republicans, socialists, anarchists, Basque and Catalan nationalists, and Carlists.

==Reign of Alfonso XII and the Regency of Maria Christina (1874–1898)==
The ''pronunciamiento'' by Martinez Campos established [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] as [[List of Spanish monarchs|king]], marking the end of the [[First Spanish Republic]]. After this, the Constitution of 1876 was written and enforced during the whole restoration. This constitution established Spain as a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a bicameral legislature ([[Cortes Generales]]), consisting of an upper house ([[Senate of Spain|Senate]]), and a lower house ([[Congress of Deputies of Spain|Congress of Deputies]]). This constitution gave the King the power to name Senators, and to revoke laws if he wanted to, and he was also given the title of [[Commander-in-chief]] of the army.

These years were marked by economic prosperity. Spain's economy was quite behind those of the other European countries, and during these years, the modernization of the country took place on a large scale. On most fronts, production was increased, and national products increased due to extreme protectionist measures.

The two parties alternated in the government in a controlled process known as ''el [[turno]] pacífico'': the Liberal Party led by [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta|Sagasta]] and the Conservative Party led by [[Canovas del Castillo]]. The ''caciques'', local powerful men, were used to manipulate election results and because of this, resentment to the system slowly built up over time, and important nationalist movements in [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], as well as unions, started to form.

==Reign of Alfonso XIII and crisis of the system (1898–1923)==
{{History of Spain|caption=|image=|}}
In 1898 Spain lost its last major overseas colonies ([[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], Guam, [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], and [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]]) in the [[Spanish–American War]]. The rapid collapse was perceived as a disaster in Spain, undermining the credibility of both the government and associated ideologies and almost led to a military coup d'état led by [[Camilo Polavieja]]. This was the start of the system's weakening, giving oxygen to all manner of conflicting opposition movements at a local and national level.&lt;ref&gt;Earl Ray Beck, ''Time of Triumph &amp; Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874-1885'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The failed attempts to conquer [[Morocco]] ([[Second Melillan campaign|Melilla War]]) caused great discontent at home and ended up in a revolt in [[Barcelona]], known as the [[Semana Tragica]], in which the lower classes of Barcelona backed by the anarchists, communists, and republicans, revolted against what they considered the unjust methods of recruiting soldiers. The government declared a state of war and sent the army to crush the revolt, causing over a hundred deaths and the execution of [[Francisco Ferrer]]. The socialist [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (UGT) and the anarchist union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) decided to initiate a general strike across the country that failed because the unions could only mobilize urban workers.

The problems in Morocco worsened as an army of natives attacked the Spanish army. They were taken by surprise and, due to the skill of the Moroccan chieftain, Abd-Al-Krim, virtually annihilated the Spanish army almost all the way to [[Melilla]] in the [[Battle of Annual]]. This defeat was due to improper planning and was blamed on the top military officers, causing great discontent among the military, who felt misunderstood, because they had been directed to advance into the interior without adequate resources to occupy the difficult territory.

==Primo de Rivera's dictatorship (1923–1930)==
The military discontent, the fear of anarchist terrorism or a proletarian revolution, and the rise of nationalisms ended up causing great agitation amongst the civilians and the military. On 13 September 1923, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], [[Captain General]] of [[Catalonia]] at that time, orchestrated a coup d'état, after emitting a manifesto blaming the problems of Spain on the parliamentary system. [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] backed the General, and named him Prime Minister. He proceeded to suspend the Constitution, and assume absolute powers as a dictator, abolishing all other parties. He created the [[Unión Patriótica Española]] which was meant to be the sole legal party. During this time, he greatly increased government spending in business and public services, which caused his government to go bankrupt. He lost the support of the military, and faced serious health problems. Opposition to his regime was so great that Alfonso XIII stopped supporting him and forced him to resign in January 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The final year (1930–1931)==
Alfonso XIII, in an attempt to return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige, called on General [[Dámaso Berenguer]] to form a government. This failed utterly, as the King was considered a supporter of the dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the establishment of a republic. Berenguer resigned and the King gave the government to Admiral Aznar. Aznar called for local elections on 12 April 1931 in order to satisfy the democrats and republicans, to replace the dictatorship's local governments and to gradually re-introduce the restoration.

Although the monarchists had not lost all their support, the republican and socialist parties won a major victory. Street riots ensued, calling for the removal of the monarchy. The army declared that they would not defend the King and on 14 April he fled Spain. The [[Second Spanish Republic]] was immediately established under a provisional government led by [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]].
