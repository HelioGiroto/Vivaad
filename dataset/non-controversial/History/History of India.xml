The '''history of India''' begins with evidence of human activity of ''[[Anatomically modern humans|Homo sapiens]]'' as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including ''[[Homo erectus]]'' from about 500,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1979) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was the first major civilization in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India'' (Penguin Books: New York, 1966) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the [[Mature Harappan]] period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;   This [[Bronze Age India|Bronze Age]] civilization collapsed before the end of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]] [[Vedic Period|Vedic Civilization]], which extended over much of the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the [[Mahajanapadas]]. In one of these kingdoms, [[Magadha]], [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha]] were born in the 6th or 5th century BCE and propagated their ''[[Shramana|śramanic]]'' philosophies.

Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the [[Maurya Empire]] during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. It became fragmented, with various parts ruled by numerous [[Middle kingdoms of India|Middle kingdoms]] for the next 1,500 years. This is known as the classical period of Indian history, during which time India has sometimes been estimated to have had the [[Economic history of India|largest economy]] of the ancient and medieval world, with its huge population generating between one fourth and one third of the world's income up to the 18th century. Much of northern and central India was united in the 4th century CE, and remained so for two centuries, under the [[Gupta Empire]]. This period, witnessing a [[Hindu]] religious and intellectual resurgence, is known among its admirers as the &quot;[[Golden Age of India]]&quot;. From this time, and for several centuries afterwards, southern India, under the rule of the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], and [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], experienced its own golden age. During this period, aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and religion ([[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]) spread to much of [[Asia]].

Kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE. Muslim rule in the subcontinent began in 8th century CE when the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in modern day Pakistan,&lt;ref name=&quot;infopak&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/History.aspx| title=History in Chronological Order| publisher=Government of Pakistan| accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting the stage for several successive invasions from Central Asia between the 10th and 15th centuries CE, leading to the formation of [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim empires in the Indian subcontinent]] such as the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. Mughal rule came from Central Asia to cover most of the northern parts of the subcontinent. Mughal rulers introduced Central Asian art and architecture to India. In addition to the Mughals and various [[Rajput kingdoms]], several independent Hindu states, such as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], the [[Maratha Empire]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga Empire]] and the [[Ahom Kingdom]], flourished contemporaneously in southern, western, eastern and northeastern India respectively. The Mughal Empire suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], [[Baloch people|Balochis]], [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]], and [[Marathas]] to exercise control over large areas in the northwest of the subcontinent until the British [[East India Company]] gained ascendancy over South Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;east_india&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html| title=Pakistan| publisher=Library of Congress| accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-18th century and over the next century, large areas of India were annexed by the British East India Company. Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], after which the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British provinces]] of India were directly administered by the [[British Raj|British Crown]] and witnessed a period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic decline. During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]] and later joined by the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. The subcontinent gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947, after the British provinces were [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into the dominions of India and [[Pakistan]] and the [[princely state]]s all [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to one of the new states.

The civilization is  primarily located in modern-day India ([[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]] provinces) and Pakistan ([[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] provinces).

The Mature Indus civilization flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilization on the subcontinent. The civilization included urban centers such as [[Dholavira]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Rupnagar|Rupar]],  [[Rakhigarhi]], and [[Lothal]] in modern-day India, and [[Harappa]], [[Ganeriwala]], and [[Mohenjo-daro]] in modern-day Pakistan. The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses.

The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India&lt;ref&gt;G.

By 500 BCE, sixteen monarchies and &quot;republics&quot; known as the [[Mahajanapadas]]—[[Kasi Kingdom|Kasi]], [[Kosala Kingdom|Kosala]], [[Anga]], [[Magadha]], [[Vajji]] (or Vriji), [[Malla (India)|Malla]], [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]], [[Vatsa]] (or Vamsa), [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]], [[Panchala]], [[Matsya Kingdom|Matsya]] (or Machcha), [[Surasena]], [[Assaka]], [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]], [[Gandhara]], and [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]]—stretched across the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] from modern-day [[Afghanistan]] to [[Bengal]] and [[Maharastra]]. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Many smaller clans mentioned within early literature seem to have been present across the rest of the subcontinent. Some of these kings were hereditary; other states elected their rulers. The educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. Many of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced to four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of [[Gautama Buddha]]. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Krishna Reddy | title = Indian History | year = 2003 | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill | location = New Delhi | isbn = 0-07-048369-8 | page = A107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Religions&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|title=World Religions in America: An Introduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=34vGv_HDGG8C&amp;pg=PA183|year=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-23320-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183}} Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as [[Vedanta]] (conclusion of the [[Vedas]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Melton|first1=J.

Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of Philosophy Eastern and Western|first=T.

Increasing urbanization of India in 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or shramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA82|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of [[Jainism]], and  [[Buddha]] (c. 563-483), founder of [[Buddhism]] were the most prominent icons of this movement. Shramana gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of [[samsara]], and the concept of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. &quot;The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara - the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana - the goal of human existence.....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha found a [[Middle Way]] that ameliorated the extreme [[asceticism]] found in the [[Sramana]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Laumakis, Stephen. ''An Introduction to Buddhist philosophy''. 2008. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Mahavira]] (the 24th [[Tirthankara]] in [[Jainism]]) propagated a theology that was to later become Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pat Fisher (1997) In: Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths I.B.Tauris : London ISBN 1-86064-148-2 - '' Jainism's major teacher is the Mahavira, a contemporary of the Buddha, and who died approximately 526 BC. Page 114 ''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars believe [[Parshva]], accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The [[Vedas]] are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the [[shramana]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pat Fisher (1997) In: Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths I.B.Tauris : London ISBN 1-86064-148-2 - '' &quot;The extreme antiquity of Jainism as a non-vedic, indigenous Indian religion is well documented.

===Persian and Greek conquests===

In 530 BCE [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], King of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] crossed the Hindu-Kush mountains to seek tribute from the tribes of Kamboja, Gandhara and the trans-India region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romila Thapar p. 58&quot;&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India: Part 1'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 520 BCE, during the reign of Darius I of Persia, much of the northwestern subcontinent (present-day eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan) came under the rule of the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]].  The area remained under Persian control for two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/acha/hd_acha.htm |title=The Achaemenid Persian Empire (550–330 B.C.E) |accessdate=2007-05-19 |author=Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art |month=October | year=2004 |work=Timeline of Art History |publisher=  New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time India supplied mercenaries to the Persian army then fighting in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romila Thapar p. 58&quot;/&gt;  Under Persian rule the famous city of Takshashila became a center where both Vedic and Iranian learning were mingled.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of Persian ideas was felt in many areas of Indian life.  Persian coinage and rock inscriptions were copied by India.  However, Persian ascendency in northern India ended with [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Persia in 327 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;      

By 326 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] had conquered Asia Minor and the Achaemenid Empire and had reached the northwest frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. There he defeated [[King Porus]] in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] (near modern-day [[Jhelum]], Pakistan) and conquered much of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=J.F.C.|authorlink=J.

His army, exhausted and frightened by the prospect of facing larger Indian armies at the Ganges River, mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern [[Beas River]]) and refused to march further East. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]], and learning about the might of [[Nanda Empire]], was convinced that it was better to return.

The Persian and Greek invasions had important repercussions on Indian civilization. The political systems of the Persians were to influence future forms of governance on the subcontinent, including the administration of the Mauryan dynasty. In addition, the region of Gandhara, or present-day eastern Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan, became a melting pot of Indian, Persian, Central Asian, and Greek cultures and gave rise to a hybrid culture, [[Greco-Buddhism]], which lasted until the 5th century CE and influenced the artistic development of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]].

===Maurya Empire===
{{Main|Maurya Empire}}
{{Further|Chandragupta Maurya|Bindusara|Ashoka the Great}}
[[Image:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka the Great]]]]
[[Image:Asokanpillar2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ashokan pillar]] at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], 3rd century BCE.]]
The [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE), ruled by the Mauryan dynasty, was a geographically extensive and powerful political and military empire in ancient India. The empire was established by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] in [[Magadha]] what is now [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  The empire flourished under the reign of [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', pp. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  At its greatest extent, it stretched to the north to the natural boundaries of the [[Himalayas]] and to the east into what is now [[Assam]]. To the west, it reached beyond modern [[Pakistan]], annexing [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], including the modern [[Herat Province|Herat]] and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] provinces.  The empire was expanded into India's central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and [[Bindusara]], but it excluded extensive unexplored tribal and forested regions near [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] which were subsequently taken by Ashoka.  Like every state, the Maurya Empire needed to have a unified administrative apparatus.  Ashoka ruled the Maurya Empire for 37 years from 268 BCE until he died in 232 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, Ashoka pursued an active foreign policy aimed at setting up a unified state.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Ashoka became involved in a war with the state of [[Kalinga]] which is located on the western shore of the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  This war forced Ashoka to abandon his attempt at a foreign policy which would unify the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mauryan Empire slavery developed rapidly and significant amount of written records on slavery are found.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard, ''A History of India'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mauryan Empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society.  However, the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Romila Thapar, ''A History of India'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary with loans made at the recognized interest rate of 15% per annum.       

Ashoka's reign propagated [[Buddhism]].  In this regard Ashoka established many Buddhist monuments.  Indeed, Ashoka put a strain on the economy and the government by his strong support of Buddhism.  towards the end of his reign he &quot;bled the state coffers white with his generous gifts to promote the promulation of Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  As might be expected, this policy caused considerable opposition within the government.  This opposition rallied around Sampadi, Ashoka's grandson and heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious opposition to 
Ashoka also arose among the orthodox Brahmanists and the adherents of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bongard-Levin, ''A History of India: Volume 1'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chandragupta's minister [[Chanakya]] wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', one of the greatest treatises on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration, military arts, war, and religion produced in Asia. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBPW). The ''Arthashastra'' and the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] are primary written records of the Mauryan times. The ''[[Lion Capital of Asoka]]'' at [[Sarnath]], is the national emblem of India.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The middle period was a time of cultural development. The [[Satavahana dynasty]], also known as the Andhras, ruled in southern and central India after around 230 BCE. [[Satakarni]], the sixth ruler of the Satvahana dynasty, defeated the [[Sunga Empire]] of north India. Afterwards, [[Kharavela]], the warrior king of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;&gt;Agrawal, Sadananda (2000): Śrī Khāravela, Sri Digambar Jain Samaj, Cuttack, Orissa&lt;/ref&gt; ruled a vast empire and was responsible for the propagation of [[Jainism]] in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;/&gt;  The Kharavelan Jain empire included a maritime empire with trading routes linking it to [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Borneo]], [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Java]]. Colonists from Kalinga settled in Sri Lanka, Burma, as well as the [[Maldives]] and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The [[Kuninda Kingdom]] was a small Himalayan state that survived from around the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. The [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] migrated from [[Central Asia]]  into northwestern India in the middle of the 1st century CE and founded an empire that stretched from [[Tajikistan]] to the middle [[Ganges]]. The [[Western Satraps]] (35-405 CE) were [[Saka]] rulers of the western and central part of India. They were the successors of the [[Indo-Scythians]] and contemporaries of the Kushans who ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and the Satavahana (Andhra) who ruled in central and southern India.
Different dynasties such as the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]], [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Gangas]], [[Pallava]]s, and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], dominated the southern part of the Indian peninsula at different periods of time. Several southern kingdoms formed overseas empires that stretched into Southeast Asia. The kingdoms warred with each other and the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] states for domination of the south. The [[Kalabhras dynasty|Kalabras]], a Buddhist dynasty, briefly interrupted the usual domination of the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas in the south.

===Northwestern hybrid cultures===
[[Image:Demetrius I of Bactria.jpg|right|thumb|120px|The founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I &quot;the Invincible&quot;]] (205–171 BCE).]]
{{See also|Indo-Greek kingdom|Indo-Scythians|Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Sassanids}}
The northwestern hybrid cultures of the subcontinent included the ''Indo-Greeks'', the ''Indo-Scythians'', the ''Indo-Parthians'', and the ''Indo-Sassinids''. The first of these, the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek Kingdom]], was founded when the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] invaded the region in 180 BCE, extending his rule over various parts of present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. Lasting for almost two centuries, the kingdom was ruled by a succession of more than 30 Greek kings, who were often in conflict with each other. The [[Indo-Scythians]] were a branch of the Indo-European [[Saka]]s ([[Scythians]]) who migrated from southern [[Siberia]], first into [[Bactria]], subsequently into [[Sogdiana]], [[Kashmir]], [[Arachosia]], and [[Gandhara]], and finally into India. Their kingdom lasted from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. Yet another kingdom, the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Parthians]] (also known as [[the Pahlavas]]), came to control most of present-day Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, after fighting many local rulers such as the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the Gandhara region. The [[Sassanid]] empire of Persia, who was contemporaneous with the Gupta Empire, expanded into the region of present-day Balochistan in Pakistan, where the mingling of Indian culture and the [[culture of Iran]] gave birth to a hybrid culture under the [[Indo-Sassanids]].

===Kushan Empire===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The [[Kushan Empire]] expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, [[Kujula Kadphises]], about the middle of the 1st century CE. By the time of his grandson, [[Kanishka]], (whose era is thought to have begun c. 127 CE), they had conquered most of northern India, at least as far as [[Saketa]] and [[Pataliputra]], in the middle Ganges Valley, and probably as far as the [[Bay of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims-Williams and Cribb (1995-1996), pp. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; They played an important role in the establishment of Buddhism in India and its spread to Central Asia and China. By the 3rd century, their empire in India was disintegrating; their last known great emperor being [[Vasudeva I]] (c. 190-225 CE).

===Roman trade with India===
{{Main|Roman trade with India}}
[[Image:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Coin of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] found at the [[Pudukottai]], [[South India]].]]
Roman trade with India started around 1 CE, during the reign of [[Augustus]] and following [[Ægyptus|his conquest]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which had been India's biggest trade partner in the West.

The trade started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130 BCE kept increasing, and according to [[Strabo]] (II.5.12.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Ethiopia]], and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from [[Myos Hormos]] to India, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise.&quot; Strabo II.5.12. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Source]&lt;/ref&gt;), by the time of Augustus, up to 120 ships set sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] on the [[Red Sea]] to India. So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] for their own coinage, that [[Pliny the Elder]] (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India:

{{quote|&quot;India, China and the Arabian peninsula take one hundred million [[sestertius|sesterces]] from our empire per annum at a conservative estimate: that is what our luxuries and women cost us. For what percentage of these imports is intended for sacrifices to the gods or the spirits of the dead?&quot;|Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?&quot; Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The maritime (but not the overland) trade routes, harbours, and trade items are described in detail in the 1st century CE [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]].

Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural center and established it as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in [[Burma]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], and [[Indochina]].

The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimize their rule, but they also patronized [[Buddhism]], which continued to provide an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers&amp;mdash;[[Chandragupta I]] (c. 319&amp;ndash;335), [[Samudragupta]] (c. 335&amp;ndash;376), and [[Chandragupta II]] (c. 376&amp;ndash;415) &amp;mdash;brought much of India under their leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/thestoryofindia/gallery/photos/8.html |title=The Story of India - Photo Gallery |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They successfully resisted the northwestern kingdoms until the arrival of the [[Huna people|Hunas]], who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century, with their capital at [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Iaroslav Lebedynsky, &quot;Les Nomades&quot;, p172.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and southern India were largely unaffected by these events in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Early History of India, p 339, Dr V. A.

The &quot;Classical Age&quot; in India began with the [[Gupta Empire]] and the resurgence of the north during [[Harsha]]'s conquests around the 7th century CE, and ended with the fall of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the south in the 13th century, due to pressure from the invaders to the north. This period produced some of India's finest art, considered the epitome of classical development, and the development of the main spiritual and philosophical systems which continued to be in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. King Harsha of [[Kannauj]] succeeded in reuniting northern India during his reign in the 7th century, after the collapse of the Gupta dynasty. His kingdom collapsed after his death.

Central Asian and North Western Indian Buddhism weakened in the 6th century after the [[White Hun]] invasion, who followed their own religions such as [[Tengri]], and [[Manichaeism]]. [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]'s invasion of Sindh in 711 CE witnessed further decline of Buddhism. The [[Chach Nama]] records many instances of conversion of stupas to mosques such as at [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Nerun]]&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie Schimmel, Religionen - Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, Brill Academic Publishers, January 1, 1980, ISBN 978-90-04-06117-0, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 7th century CE, [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] formulated hi school of [[Mimamsa]] philosophy and defended the position on Vedic rituals against Buddhist attacks.

From the 7th to the 9th century, three dynasties contested for control of northern India: the [[Gurjara Pratihara]]s of [[Malwa]],the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] of [[Orissa]], the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]s of [[Bengal]], and the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The [[Sena dynasty]] would later assume control of the Pala Empire, and the Gurjara Pratiharas fragmented into various states. These were the first of the [[Rajput]] states, a series of kingdoms which managed to survive in some form for almost a millennium, until Indian independence from the British. The first recorded Rajput kingdoms emerged in [[Rajasthan]] in the 6th century, and small Rajput dynasties later ruled much of northern India. One [[Gurjar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Chalukya dynasty]] ruled parts of southern and central India from [[Badami]] in [[Karnataka]] between 550 and 750, and then again from [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]] between 970 and 1190. The [[Pallava]]s of [[Kanchipuram]] were their contemporaries further to the south.

The Hindu [[Vijayanagar Empire]] came into conflict with the Islamic [[Bahmani Sultanate]], and the clashing of the two systems caused a mingling of the indigenous and foreign cultures that left lasting cultural influences on each other.

Additionally, Muslim trading communities had flourished throughout coastal south India, particularly on the western coast, where Muslim traders arrived in small numbers, mainly from the Arabian peninsula. This had marked the introduction of a third [[Abraham]]ic Middle Eastern religion, following Judaism and Christianity, often in puritanical form. Later, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and [[Deccan sultanates]] founded by Turkic rulers, flourished in the south.  

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off [[Islamic invasions of India|Islamic invasions]] by the end of the 13th century. The empire dominated all of Southern India and fought off invasions from the five established [[Deccan Sultanates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nilakanta Sastri|first= K.A.|title=   A history of South India from prehistoric times to the fall of Vijayanagar|origyear=1955|year=2002|publisher= Indian Branch, Oxford University Press|location= New Delhi|page=239|isbn= 0-19-560686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire reached its peak during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious.&lt;ref&gt;From the notes of Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes about Krishnadevaraya: ''A king who was perfect in all things'' (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'' 2003, p. 31.)&lt;/ref&gt; The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kamath|first= Suryanath U.|title=A concise history of Karnataka: from pre-historic times to the present|origyear=1980|year= 2001|publisher= Jupiter books|location= Bangalore|page=186|oclc= 7796041 |lccn= 8095179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted until 1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]].

{{Main|Delhi Sultanate}}
In the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Turkic people|Turk]]s and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]]s invaded parts of northern India and established the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the former [[Rajput]] holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Seven.html Battuta's Travels: Delhi, capital of Muslim India]&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Slave dynasty]] of [[Delhi]] managed to conquer large areas of northern India, approximately equal in extent to the ancient [[Gupta Empire]], while the [[Khilji dynasty]] was also able to conquer most of central India, but were ultimately unsuccessful in conquering and uniting the subcontinent. The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting &quot;Indo-Muslim&quot; fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of [[Urdu]] (literally meaning &quot;horde&quot; or &quot;camp&quot; in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic [[Prakrit]]s with immigrants speaking [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] under the Muslim rulers. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to have enthroned one of the few female rulers in India, [[Razia Sultana]] (1236–1240).

Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins, after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the [[sayyid]]s, scholars, and the other Muslims; 100,000 war prisoners were put to death in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of India As told By Its Own Historians Vol III|author=Elliot &amp; Dawson |pages=445–446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal Empire===
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}

In 1526, [[Babur]], a [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] descendant of [[Timur]] and [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] from [[Fergana Valley]] (modern day [[Uzbekistan]]), swept across the [[Khyber Pass]] and established the [[Mughal Empire]], covering modern day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Great Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his son [[Humayun]] was defeated by the Afghan warrior [[Sher Shah Suri]] in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to [[Kabul]]. After Sher Shah's death, his son [[Islam Shah Suri]] and the Hindu king [[Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], who had won 22 battles against Afghan rebels and forces of Akbar, from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] to [[Bengal]] and had established a secular [[Hindu]] rule in North India from [[Delhi]] till 1556. [[Akbar]]'s forces defeated and killed [[Hemu]] in the [[Battle of Panipat (1556)|Second Battle of Panipat]] on 6 November 1556. 

The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600; it went into a slow decline after 1707. The Mughals suffered sever blow due to invasions from [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] due to which the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal dynasty]] were reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were finally defeated during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], also called the 1857 War of Independence. This period marked vast social change in the subcontinent as the Hindu majority were ruled over by the Mughal emperors, most of whom showed religious tolerance, liberally patronising Hindu culture. The famous emperor Akbar, who was the grandson of Babar, tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. However, later emperors such as [[Aurangazeb]] tried to establish complete Muslim dominance, and as a result several historical temples were destroyed during this period and taxes imposed on non-Muslims. During the decline of the Mughal Empire, several smaller states rose to fill the power vacuum and themselves were contributing factors to the decline. In 1739, [[Nader Shah]], emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the huge [[Battle of Karnal]]. After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away many treasures, including the [[Peacock Throne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Shah.php Iran in the Age of the Raj]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mughals were perhaps the richest single dynasty to have ever existed. During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces consisted of the Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states - including the [[Maratha Empire]] - which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals, while often employing brutal tactics to subjugate their empire, had a policy of integration with Indian culture, which is what made them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. Akbar the Great was particularly famed for this. Akbar declared &quot;Amari&quot; or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the ''[[jizya]]'' tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local ''[[maharajas]]'', and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique [[Mughal architecture|Indo-Saracenic architecture]]. It was the erosion of this tradition coupled with increased brutality and centralization that played a large part in the dynasty's downfall after [[Aurangzeb]], who unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively non-pluralistic policies on the general population, which often inflamed the majority Hindu population.

====Maratha Empire ====
{{Main|Maratha Empire}}
The post-Mughal era was dominated by the rise of the Maratha suzerainty as other small regional states (mostly late Mughal tributary states) emerged, and also by the increasing activities of European powers (see colonial era below). There is no doubt that the single most important power to emerge in the long twilight of the Mughal dynasty was the [[Maratha Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by [[Shivaji]], a [[Maratha]] aristocrat of the [[Bhonsle]] clan who was determined to establish [[Hindavi Swarajya]] (self-rule of [[Hindu]] people). By the 18th century, it had transformed itself into the [[Maratha Empire]] under the rule of the ''[[Peshwa]]s'' (prime ministers). Gordon explains how the Maratha systematically took control over the Malwa plateau in 1720-1760. They started with annual raids, collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control. However in 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, Delhi inteslf, and as a result, the Mughal emperor ceded Malwa to them. The Marathas continued [[Battles involving the Maratha Empire|their military campaigns]] against [[Mughals]], [[Nizam]], [[Nawab of Bengal]] and [[Durrani Empire]] to further extend their boundaries. They built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. The cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors (kamavisdars) who advanced the Maratha ruler '(Peshwa)' a portion of their district revenues at interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart N. Gordon, &quot;The Slow Conquest: Administrative Integration of Malwa into the Maratha Empire, 1720-1760,&quot; ''Modern Asian Studies,'' Jan 1977, 11#1 pp 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across practically the entire subcontinent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ansar&quot;/&gt; The defeat of Marathas by British in three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] brought end to the empire by 1820. The last ''peshwa'', [[Baji Rao II]], was defeated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]].

The Punjabi kingdom, ruled by members of the [[Sikhism|Sikh religion]], was a political entity that governed the region of modern-day [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The empire, based around the [[Punjab region]], existed from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the [[Khalsa]], under the leadership of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] (1780–1839) from an array of autonomous [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Misls]]. He consolidated many parts of northern India into a kingdom. He primarily used his highly disciplined Sikh army that he trained and equipped to be the equal of a European force. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well qualified generals for his army. In stages, he added the central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, the Peshawar Valley, and the Derajat to his kingdom. His came in the face of the powerful British East India Company.&lt;ref&gt;Gulcharan Singh, &quot;Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the Principles of War,&quot; ''USI Journal,'' July 1981, Vol. 111 Issue 465, pp 184-192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grewal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=J.

This was among the last areas of the subcontinent to be conquered by the British. The [[First Anglo-Sikh War|first]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|second Anglo-Sikh war]] marked the downfall of the [[Sikh Empire]].

====Other kingdoms====
There were several other kingdoms which ruled over parts of India in the later medieval period prior to the British occupation. However, most of them were bound to pay regular tribute to the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ansar&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XRpFol4AnO0C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=marathas+they+were+either+masters+directly+or+they+took+tribute&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u8fCv6tT9S&amp;sig=1Cj9lxYXUtzM5CbCztnts-iTyVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ms4UUNzSLcLRrQfYo4DICg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marathas%20they%20were%20either%20masters%20directly%20or%20they%20took%20tribute&amp;f=false The Rediscovery of India: A New Subcontinent] Cite: ''&quot;Swarming up from the Himalayas, the Marathas now ruled from the Indus and Himalayas in the north to the south tip of the peninsula.

Under their rule, Mysore fought a [[Anglo-Mysore Wars|series of wars]] sometimes against the combined forces of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Marathas]], but mostly against the British, with Mysore receiving some aid or promise of aid from the [[France|French]]. 

The [[Nawab of Bengal|Nawabs of Bengal]] had become the de facto rulers of [[Bengal]] following the decline of Mughal Empire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried [[Expeditions in Bengal|six expeditions in Bengal]] from 1741 to 1748 as a result of which Bengal became a vassal state of [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]]. 

Hyderabad was founded by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] of [[Golconda]] in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad]] in 1724. It was ruled by a hereditary Nizam from 1724 until 1948. Both Mysore and Hyderabad became princely states in British India.

Around the 18th century, the modern state of [[Nepal]] was formed by [[Gurkha]] rulers.

The First [[Carnatic War]] extended from 1746 until 1748 and was the result of colonial competition between France and Britain, two of the countries involved in the [[War of Austrian Succession]].  Following the capture of a few French ships by the [[Royal Indian Navy|British fleet in India]], French troops attacked and captured the British city of [[Madras]] located on the east coast of India on September 21, 1746.  Among the prisoners captured at Madras was [[Robert Clive]] himself.  The war was eventually ended by the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] which ended the [[War of Austrian Succession]] in 1748.  

In 1749, the Second Carnatic War broke out as the result of a war between a son, [[Nasir Jung]], and a grandson, [[Muhyi ad-Din Muzaffar Jang Hidayat|Muzaffer Jung]], of the deceased [[Nizam-ul-Mulk]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] to take over  Nizam's thone in Hyderabad.  The French supported Muzaffer Jung in this civil war.   Consequently, the British supported Nasir Jung in this conflict.  

Meanwhile, however, the conflict in Hyderabad provided [[Chanda Sahib]] with an opportunity to take power as the new [[Nawab]] of the territory of [[Arcot]].  In this conflict, the French supported Chandra Sahib in his attempt to become the new Nawab of Arcot.  The British supported the son of the deposed incumbent Nawab, [[Anwaruddin Muhammad Khan]], against Chanda Sahib.  In 1751, Robert Clive led a British armed force and captured Arcot to reinstate the incumbent Nawab.  The Second Carnatic War finally came to an end in 1754 with the [[Treaty of Pondicherry]].  

In 1756, the [[Seven Years War]] broke out between the great powers of Europe, and India became a theatre of action, where it was called the [[Third Carnatic War]].  Early in this war, armed forces under the French East India Company captured the British base of [[Calcutta]] in north-eastern India.  However, armed forces under Robert Clive later recaptured Calcutta and then pressed on to capture the French settlement of [[Chandannagar]] in 1757.  This led to the [[Battle of Plassey]] on June 23, 1757, in which the [[Bengal Army]] of the East India Company, led by [[Robert Clive]], defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces.  This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was combined with British victories over the French at [[Siege of Madras|Madras]], [[Battle of Wandiwash|Wandiwash]] and [[Siege of Pondicherry (1760)|Pondicherry]] that, along with wider [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|British successes during the Seven Years War]], reduced French influence in India. Thus as a result of the three Carnatic Wars, the British East India Company gained exclusive control over the entire Carnatic region of India.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (1997) pp 30-44&lt;/ref&gt;  The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]]; this marked the beginning of its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India and extinguished the Moghul rule and dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The East India Company monopolized the trade of Bengal. They introduced a land taxation system called the [[Permanent Settlement]] which introduced a [[feudalism|feudal]]-like structure in Bengal, often with [[zamindar]]s set in place. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled most of the Indian sub-continent, which included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh. Their policy was sometimes summed up as [[Divide and Rule]], taking advantage of the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;H. V. Bowen, ''The Business of Empire: The East India Company and Imperial Britain, 1756-1833'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu [[Ahom Kingdom]] of [[North-east India]] first fell to [[Burmese invasions of Assam|Burmese invasion]] and then to British after [[Treaty of Yandabo]] in 1826.

=== The rebellion of 1857 and its consequences ===
{{Main|Indian rebellion of 1857 }}

The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India in northern and central India against the Company's rule. The rebels were disorganized, had differing goals, and were poorly equipped, led, and trained, and had no outside support or funding. They were brutally suppressed and the British government took control of the Company and eliminated many of the grievances that caused it. The government also was determined to keep full control so that no rebellion of such size would ever happen again.  It favoured the princely states (that helped suppress the rebellion), and tended to favour Muslims (who were less rebellious) against the Hindus who dominated the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert, ''The Great Mutiny: India 1857''  (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath, all power was transferred from the East India Company to the [[British Crown]], which began to administer most of India as a number of provinces; the John Company's lands were controlled directly, while it had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the [[Princely states]] ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947-48.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm von Pochhammer, ''India's road to nationhood: a political history of the subcontinent'' (1981) ch 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Raj==
{{main|British Raj}}
[[File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|right|The British Indian Empire at its greatest extent (in a map of 1909). The [[princely state]]s under British suzerainty are in yellow.]]

===Reforms===
When the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] (Viceroy 1899-1905) took control of higher education and then [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|split the large province of Bengal]] into a largely Hindu western half and &quot;Eastern Bengal and Assam,&quot; a largely Muslim eastern half. The British goal was efficient administration but Hindus were outraged at the apparent &quot;divide and rule&quot; strategy.&quot; When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906 he was removed. The new Viceroy [[Gilbert Minto]] and the new Secretary of State for India [[John Morley]] consulted with Congress leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]]. The [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Morley-Minto reforms of 1909]] provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council. The Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged from 25 to 60 members and separate communal representation for Muslims was established in a dramatic step towards representative and responsible government. Bengal was reunified in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Wolpert, ''Morley and India, 1906-1910,'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile the Muslims for the first time began to organize, setting up the [[All India Muslim League]] in 1906. It was not a mass party but was designed to protect the interests of the aristocratic Muslims, especially in the north west. It was internally divided by conflicting loyalties to Islam, the British, and India, and by distrust of Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;Satya Narayan Mishra, &quot;Muslim Backwardness and Birth of the Muslim League,&quot; ''Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society,'' Jan 2007, Vol. 55 Issue 1/2, pp 71-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famines===
During the British Raj, [[famine in India|famines in India]], often attributed to failed government policies, were some of the worst ever recorded, including the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died&lt;ref name=mikedavis&gt;Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. ISBN 1-85984-739-0 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Indian famine of 1899–1900]] in which 1.25 to 10 million people died.&lt;ref name=mikedavis&gt;Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. ISBN 1-85984-739-0 pg 173&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third plague pandemic|Third Plague Pandemic]] started in China in the middle of the 19th century, spreading plague to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/zoonotic/en/index4.html Plague]. World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite persistent diseases and famines, the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which stood at about 125 million in 1750, had reached 389 million by 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/chapters_preview/98/1iie2806.pdf Reintegrating India with the World Economy]. ''Peterson Institute for International Economics.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Indian independence movement===
{{Main|Indian independence movement|Pakistan Movement}}
{{See also|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Indian independence activists}}
[[File:Gandhi Jinnah 1944.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], Bombay, 1944.]]
The numbers of British in India were small, yet they were able to rule two-thirds of the subcontinent directly and exercise considerable leverage over the [[princely states]] that accounted for the remaining one-third of the area. There were 674 of the these states in 1900, with a population of 73 million, or one person in five.  In general, the princely states were strong supporters of the British regime, and the Raj left them alone. They were finally closed down in 1947-48.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (2000) pp 322-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of councillors to advise the British [[viceroy]], in 1861; the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councillors' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large [[British Indian Army]], with the senior officers all British, and many of the troops from small minority groups such as [[Gurkha]]s from Nepal and [[Sikhs]]. The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions.&lt;ref&gt;Anil Chandra Banerjee, ''A Constitutional History of India 1600-1935'' (1978) p 171-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1920 leaders such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] began highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. Some others adopted a militant approach that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle; [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]] against the British rule took place throughout the Indian sub-continent. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation]], [[Dandi March|civil disobedience]] and [[Swadeshi movement|economic resistance]]. These movements succeeded in bringing independence to the new dominions of India and [[Pakistan]] in 1947.

==Independence and partition==
{{Main|Partition of India|History of the Republic of India|History of Pakistan|History of Bangladesh}}
Along with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although [[Gandhi]] called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership. The British, extremely weakened by the [[World War II|Second World War]], promised that they would leave and participated in the formation of an [[Interim Government of India|interim government]]. The [[British India]]n territories gained independence in 1947, after being [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into the [[Union of India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. Following the controversial division of pre-partition [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]], rioting broke out between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in these provinces and spread to several other parts of India, leaving some 500,000 dead.&lt;ref name=symonds&gt;{{cite book

 | quote = at the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).&lt;ref name=symonds/&gt; In 1971, [[Bangladesh]], formerly [[East Pakistan]] and [[East Bengal]], seceded from Pakistan.

==Historiography==
In recent decades there have been four main schools of historiography regarding India: Cambridge, Nationalist, Marxist, and subaltern.  The once common  &quot;Orientalist&quot; approach, with its the image of a sensuous, inscrutable, and wholly spiritual India, has died out in serious scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Gyan Prakesh, &quot;Writing Post-Orientalist Histories of the Third World: Perspectives from Indian Historiography&quot; ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' (1990), 32 : pp 383-408 {{doi|10.1017/S0010417500016534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Cambridge School,&quot; led by Anil Seal,&lt;ref&gt;Anil Seal, ''The Emergence of Indian Nationalism: Competition and Collaboration in the Later Nineteenth Century'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Johnson, ''Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism: Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880-1915'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gordon, and David A. Washbrook,&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind O'Hanlon and David Washbrook, eds. ''Religious Cultures in Early Modern India: New Perspectives'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; downplays ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Aravind Ganachari, &quot;Studies in Indian Historiography: 'The Cambridge School,'&quot; ''Indica,'' March 2010, 47#1, pp 70-93&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Nationalist school has focused on Congress, Gandhi, Nehru and high level politics. It highlighted the Mutiny of 1857 as a war of liberation, and Gandhi's 'Quit India' begun in 1942, as defining historical events. More recently, Hindu nationalists have created a version of history for the schools to support their demands for [[Hindutva#Views on Indian history|&quot;Hindutva&quot;]] (&quot;Hinduness&quot;) in Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;Latha Menon, &quot;Coming to Terms with the Past: India,&quot; ''History Today,'' Aug 2004, 54#8 pp 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxists have focused on studies of economic development, landownership, and class conflict in precolonial India and of deindustrialization during the colonial period.  The Marxists portrayed Gandhi's movement as a device for the bourgeois elite to harness popular, potentially revolutionary forces for its own ends.&lt;ref&gt;Amiya Kumar   Bagchi, &quot;Writing Indian History in the Marxist Mode in a Post-Soviet World,&quot; ''Indian Historical Review,'' Jan 1993, Vol. 20 Issue 1/2, pp 229-244,&lt;/ref&gt; 

The &quot;subaltern school,&quot; was begun in the 1980s by [[Ranajit Guha]] and [[Gyan Prakash]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyan Prakash, &quot;Subaltern studies as postcolonial criticism,&quot; ''American Historical Review,'' Dec 1994, 99#5 pp 1475-1500&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses attention away from the elites and politicians to &quot;history from below,&quot; looking at the peasants using folklore, poetry, riddles, proverbs, songs, oral history and methods inspired by anthropology. It focuses on the colonial era before 1947 and typically emphasizes caste and downplays class, to the annoyance of the Marxist school.&lt;ref&gt;John Roosa, &quot;When the Subaltern Took the Postcolonial Turn,&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association,'' 2006, Vol. 17 Issue 2, pp 130-147&lt;/ref&gt;
