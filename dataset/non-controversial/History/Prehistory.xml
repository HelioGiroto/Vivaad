'''Prehistory''' (meaning &quot;before history,&quot; from the [[Latin]] word for &quot;before,&quot; ''præ'') is the span of time before [[recorded history]] or the invention of writing systems. Prehistory can refer to the period of human existence before the availability of those written records with which recorded history begins.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. Prehistory The Making Of The Human Mind. New York: Modern Library,2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it refers to all the time preceding human existence and the invention of writing. Archaeologist Paul Tournal originally coined the term ''anté-historique''&lt;ref&gt;pre-historic (french)&lt;/ref&gt; in describing the finds he had made in the caves of [[southern France]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruno David, Bryce Barker, Ian J. McNiven (2006). The social archaeology of Australian indigenous societies. Page 55. (cf. &quot;A parallel term anté-historique had earlier been coined by Paul Tournal.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term came into use in France in the 1830s to describe the time before writing, and the word &quot;prehistoric&quot; was later introduced into [[English language|English]] by archaeologist [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]] in 1851.&lt;ref

The term &quot;prehistory&quot; can refer to the vast span of time since the [[big bang|beginning]] of the [[Universe]], but more often it refers to the period since [[life]] appeared on [[Earth]], or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;fagan07&quot;&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2007. ''World Prehistory: A brief introduction''  New York:Prentice-Hall,  Seventh Edition, Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;renfrew&quot;&gt;Renfrew, Colin. 2008.  ''Prehistory: The Making of the Human Mind.&quot;  New York: Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;  In dividing up human prehistory, prehistorians typically use the [[three-age system]], whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the [[chronostratigraphy|well defined]] [[geologic record]] and its internationally defined [[stratum]] base within the [[era (geology)|geologic time scale]]. The three-age system is the [[periodization]] of [[human]] prehistory into three consecutive [[time period]]s, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies: the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]]. Another division of history and prehistory can be made between those written events that can be precisely dated by use of a continuous calendar dating from current and those that can't. The loss of continuity of calendar date most often occurs when a civilization falls and the language and calendar fall into disuse. The current civilization therefore loses the ability to precisely date events written through primary sources to events dated to current calendar dating.

The occurrence of [[Writing|written materials]] (and so the beginning of local &quot;historic times&quot;) varies generally to cultures classified within either the late Bronze Age or within the Iron Age. Historians increasingly do not restrict themselves to evidence from written records and are coming to rely more upon evidence from the natural and social sciences, thereby blurring the distinction between the terms &quot;history&quot; and &quot;prehistory&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This view has recently{{When|date=December 2011}} been articulated by advocates of [[deep history]].

This article is primarily concerned with human prehistory, or the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appear until the beginning of recorded history. There are separate articles for the overall [[history of the Earth]] and the [[history of life]] before humans.

== Definition ==
Because, by definition, there are no written records from human prehistory, dating of prehistoric materials is particularly crucial to the enterprise.  Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graslund, Bo. 1987.  ''The birth of prehistoric chronology.''  Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary researchers into [[human]] prehistory are prehistoric [[archaeologists]] and physical [[anthropologists]] who use excavation, geologic and geographic surveys, and other scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;fagan07&quot;/&gt; Human population [[geneticists]] and historical [[linguists]] are also providing valuable insight for these questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;renfrew&quot;/&gt;  Cultural anthropologists help provide context for marriage{{clarify|date=April 2011|reason=how can marriage be proven among pre-historic people without documentation?}} and trade, by which objects of human origin pass among people, allowing an analysis of any article that arises in a human prehistoric context.&lt;ref name=&quot;renfrew&quot;/&gt; Therefore, data about prehistory is provided by a wide variety of natural and social sciences, such as [[paleontology]], [[biology]], [[archaeology]], [[palynology]], [[geology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], [[comparative linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[molecular genetics]] and many others.

Prehistory is an important part of [[evolutionary psychology]] since it is argued that many human characteristics are [[adaptation]]s to the prehistoric environment and in particular the environment during the long [[paleolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss,  Chapter 1, pp. 5-67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides&lt;/ref&gt;

Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of its [[chronology]] but in the way it deals with the activities of [[archaeological culture]]s rather than named [[nation]]s or [[individual]]s.  Restricted to material processes, remains and artifacts rather than written records, prehistory is anonymous. Because of this, reference terms that prehistorians use, such as [[Neanderthal]] or [[Iron Age]] are modern labels with definitions sometimes subject to debate.

The date marking the end of prehistory in a particular culture or region, that is the date when relevant [[List of languages by first written accounts|written historical]] records become a useful academic resource, varies enormously from region to region. For example, in [[Egypt]] it is generally accepted  that prehistory ended around 3200 [[Before Christ|BC]], whereas in [[New Guinea]] the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 [[AD]].  In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had neighbouring cultures, including the [[Celts]] and to a lesser extent the [[Etruscans]], with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of the &quot;prehistoric&quot; cultures in Greek and Roman literature.

== Stone Age ==
=== Paleolithic ===
{{Main|Paleolithic|Recent African origin of modern humans|Archaic Homo sapiens|Early human migrations}}
[[Image:Map-of-human-migrations.svg|thumb|400px|Map of early [[human migrations]], according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]]. Numbers are [[millennia]] before the present (accuracy disputed).]]

&quot;Paleolithic&quot; means &quot;Old Stone Age,&quot;  and begins with the first use of [[stone tool]]s.  The Paleolithic is the earliest period of the [[Stone Age]].

The early part of the Paleolithic is called the [[Lower Paleolithic]], which predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (and related species) and with the earliest stone tools, dated to around 2.5 million years ago.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
[[Early Homo sapiens|''Early'' homo sapiens]]  originated some 200,000 years ago, ushering in the [[Middle Paleolithic]].  Anatomic changes indicating modern language capacity also arise during the Middle Paleolithic.{{Citation needed|reason=date-April 2009|date=April 2009}}  The systematic [[paleolithic burial|burial of the dead]], the [[origin of music|music]], [[prehistoric art|early art]], and the use of increasingly sophisticated multi-part tools are highlights of the Middle Paleolithic.

Throughout the Paleolithic, humans generally lived as [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. [[Hunter-gatherer#Social structure|Hunter-gatherer societies]] tended to be very small and egalitarian{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}, though hunter-gatherer societies with abundant resources or advanced food-storage techniques sometimes developed sedentary lifestyles with complex social structures such as chiefdoms, and [[social stratification]].  Long-distance contacts may have been established, as in the case of [[Indigenous Australian]] &quot;highways.&quot;

=== Mesolithic ===
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
[[File:Canoe on beach.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dugout canoe]]]]
The &quot;Mesolithic,&quot; or &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot; (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;''mesos'',&quot; &quot;middle,&quot; and &quot;''lithos'',&quot; &quot;stone&quot;) was the period in the development of [[human]] [[technology]] between the Paleolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age.

The Mesolithic period began at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, some 10,000 BP, and ended with [[Agriculture#History|the introduction of agriculture]], the date of which varied by geographic region.  In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short and poorly defined. In areas with limited [[glacial]] impact, the term &quot;[[Epipaleolithic]]&quot; is sometimes preferred.

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the [[last ice age]] ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era, lasting millennia. In [[Northern Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marsh]]lands fostered by the warmer climate. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours that are preserved in the material record, such as the [[Maglemosian]] and [[Azilian]] cultures. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 [[Before Christ|BC]] (6,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) in northern [[Europe]].

Remains from this period are few and far between, often limited to [[midden]]s. In [[forest]]ed areas, the first signs of [[deforestation]] have been found, although this would only begin in earnest during the Neolithic, when more space was needed for [[agriculture]].

The Mesolithic is characterized in most areas by small composite [[flint]] tools — [[microlith]]s and [[microburin]]s. [[Fishing tackle]], stone [[adze]]s and wooden objects, e.g. [[canoe]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows]], have been found at some sites.  These technologies first occur in [[Africa]], associated with the Azilian cultures, before spreading to Europe through the [[Ibero-Maurusian]] culture of Northern Africa and the [[Kebaran]] culture of the [[Levant]]. Independent discovery is not always ruled out.

=== Neolithic ===
{{Main|Neolithic}}
[[Image:Malta Hagar Qim BW 2011-10-04 16-39-32.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the [[Ġgantija phase]] temple complex of [[Hagar Qim]], [[Malta]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagemalta.org/hagarqim.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&quot;Neolithic&quot; means &quot;New Stone Age.&quot;  This was a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, toward the end of the &quot;Stone Age&quot;.  The Neolithic period saw the development of early [[village]]s, [[agriculture]], [[animal]] [[domestication]], [[tool]]s and the onset of the earliest recorded incidents of [[war]]fare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfectirishgifts.com/blog/2008/06/prehistoric_massacres_the_twin.html The Perfect Gift: Prehistoric Massacres. The twin vices of women and cattle in prehistoric Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Neolithic'' term is commonly used in the [[Old World]], as its application to cultures in the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] that did not fully develop metal-working technology raises problems.

==== Agriculture ====
{{Main|History of agriculture}}
[[Forest gardening]], originating in prehistory, is thought to be the world's oldest known form of agriculture (or [[agroecosystem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vere Gordon Childe]] then describes an &quot;[[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]&quot; occurring about the 10th millennium BC with the [[Agriculture#History|adoption of agriculture]] and [[domestication]] of plants and animals. The [[Sumerians]] first began farming c. 9500 BC. By 7000 BC, agriculture had been developed in [[India]] and [[Peru]] separately; by 6000 BC, to Egypt; by 5000 BC, to China. About 2700 BC, agriculture had come to [[Mesoamerica]].

Although attention has tended to concentrate on the [[Middle East]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], archaeology in the [[Americas]], [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] indicates that agricultural systems, using different crops and animals, may in some cases have developed there nearly as early. The development of organised [[irrigation]], and the use of a specialised [[workforce]], by the [[Sumerians]], began about 5500 BC. Stone was supplanted by bronze and iron in implements of agriculture and warfare. Agricultural settlements had until then been almost completely dependent on [[Rock (geology)|stone]] tools. In [[Eurasia]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]] tools, decorations and weapons began to be commonplace about 3000 BC. After bronze, the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Middle East]] and [[China]] saw the introduction of [[iron]] tools and weapons.

{{legend|#FFFFFF|uninhabited}}]]
The Americas may not have had metal tools until the [[Chavín culture|Chavín]] horizon (900 BC). The [[Moche]] did have metal armor, knives and tableware. Even the metal-poor [[Inca]] had metal-tipped plows, at least after the conquest of [[Chimor]]. However, little archaeological research has so far been done in [[Peru]], and nearly all the ''[[khipus]]'' (recording devices, in the form of knots, used by the Incas) were burned in the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]].  As late as 2004, entire [[cities]] were still being unearthed.

The cradles of early [[civilization]]s were [[river]] [[valley]]s, such as the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] valleys in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile River|Nile]] valley in [[Egypt]], the [[Indus River|Indus]] valley in the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] valleys in [[China]]. Some nomadic peoples, such as the Indigenous Australians and the [[Bushmen]] of southern Africa, did not practice agriculture until relatively recent times.

Agriculture made possible complex societies — [[civilizations]]. States and markets emerged. Technologies enhanced people's ability to harness [[nature]] and to develop [[transport]] and [[communication]].&quot;The city represented a new degree of human concentration, a new magnitude in settlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. The City In History Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects. New York: A Harvest Book Harcourt, Inc, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities relied on agricultural surplus.&quot;since the inhabitants of a city do not produce their own food...cities cannot support themselves...thus exist only where agriculture is successful enough to produce agricultural surplus.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ziomkowski, Robert. The Best Test Preparation for the Western Civilization. New Jersey: Research &amp; Educational Association, 2006. E book.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalcolithic===
{{Main|Chalcolithic}}
In Old World archaeology, the &quot;Chalcolithic&quot;, &quot;Eneolithic&quot; or &quot;Copper Age&quot; refers to a transitional period where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the widespread use of stone tools.

== Bronze Age ==
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ox]]-drawn [[plow]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], ca. 1200 BC.]]
The term '''Bronze Age''' refers to a period in human cultural development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ores, and then combining them to cast [[bronze]]. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity.  Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before 3000 BC. The Bronze Age forms part of the [[three-age system]] for prehistoric societies. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic]] in some areas of the world.

The Bronze Age is the earliest period for which we have direct written accounts, since the invention of [[writing]] coincides with its early beginnings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Iron Age ==
{{Main|Iron Age|Classical antiquity}}

In [[archaeology]], the '''Iron Age''' refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. The adoption of [[iron]] coincided with other changes in some past cultures, often including more sophisticated agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, which makes the archaeological Iron Age coincide with the &quot;[[Axial Age]]&quot; in the history of philosophy.
