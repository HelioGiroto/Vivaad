[[File:Yerevan-sunset.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mount Ararat|Mt. Ararat]] view from [[Yerevan]]]]
[[File:Moses of Chorene.jpg|left|thumb|an Armenian manuscript]]

[[Armenia]] lies in the highlands surrounding the Biblical mountains of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]. The original [[Armenians|Armenian]] name for the country was [[Hayk]], later Hayastan ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայաստան), translated as the land of Haik, and consisting of the name of the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Hayasa-Azzi|Haya]]&lt;ref&gt;http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/haya/&lt;/ref&gt; (ha-ià) and the indoeuropean suffix '-stan' (land). The historical enemy of [[Hayk]] (the legendary ruler of Armenia), ''Hayastan'', was [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], or in other words [[Baal]] (Akkadian cognate [[Bel (mythology)|Bēlu]]). The word &quot;Bel&quot; is named in the Bible at Isaiah 46:1 and Jeremiah 50:2 and 51:44.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vahan Kurkjian, &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, ''The Beginnings of Armenia, Chapter VIII'' Michigan, 1968, [penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/8*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, and it is traditionally derived from Armenak or [[Aram (given name)|Aram]] (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all [[Armenians]]).
In the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600–1200 BC). Soon after the Hayasa-Azzi were the [[Nairi people|Nairi]] (1400–1000 BC) and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000–600 BC), who successively established their sovereignty over the [[Armenian Highland]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] people.&lt;ref&gt;Vahan Kurkjian, &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, Michigan, 1968, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html]; Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia, v. 12, Yerevan 1987; Artak Movsisyan, &quot;Sacred Highland: Armenia in the spiritual conception of the Near East&quot;, Yerevan, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yerevan]], the modern capital of Armenia, was founded in 782 BC by king [[Argishti I]].

The Iron Age kingdom of [[Urartu]] ([[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] for [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) was replaced by the [[Orontid dynasty]].
Following Persian and Macedonian rule, the [[Artaxias I|Artaxiad]] dynasty from 190 BC gave rise to the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] which rose to the peak of its influence under  [[Tigranes II]] before falling under Roman rule.

In 301, [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid Armenia]] was the first sovereign nation to accept Christianity as a state religion. The [[Armenians]] later fell under [[Byzantine]], [[Persian Empire|Persian]], and [[Islamic]] hegemony, but reinstated their independence with the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]] kingdom of Armenia. After the fall of the kingdom in 1045, and the subsequent Seljuk conquest of Armenia in 1064, the Armenians established a kingdom in [[Cilicia]], where they   prolonged their sovereignty to 1375.

Greater Armenia was later divided between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Russia]]. In the early 20th century Armenians suffered in the genocide inflicted on them by the Ottomans, in which 1.5 million Armenians  were killed and many more [[Armenian diaspora|dispersed]] throughout the world via [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Armenia, from then on corresponding to much of [[Eastern Armenia]], regained independence in 1918, with the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]], and in 1991, the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]].

==Prehistory==
{{main|Prehistoric Armenia}}

The [[Armenian Highland]] shows traces of settlement from the [[Neolithic]] era. Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 have resulted in the discovery of the world's earliest known leather shoe, skirt, and wine-making facility at the [[Areni-1 cave complex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN|title=The first leather shoe|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-09/world/armenia.old.shoe_1_shoe-cave-leather?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate =2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strawskirt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.am/eng/news/73915.html | title = 5,900-year-old women’s skirt discovered in Armenian cave | first =  | last =  | work = News Armenia | date = September 13, 2011 | accessdate = September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|title=National Geographic: the first wine-making facility in Armenia|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/110111-oldest-wine-press-making-winery-armenia-science-ucla/|accessdate =2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chalcolithic leather shoe from Areni-1 cave.jpg|left|thumb|A 5500 years old leather shoe, oldest found in the world, discovered in the Areni cave in [[Armenia]], see [[Areni-1 shoe]]]]

The [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture]] of the central [[Transcaucasus]] region is one of the earliest known prehistoric culture in the area, carbon-dated to roughly 6000 – 4000 BC.

===Bronze Age===
[[File:Zorats Karer 2008, part of the stone circle.jpg|right|thumb|Prehistoric observatory [[Zorats Karer]] (also known as [[Zorats Karer|Karahunj]]).]]

An early Bronze Age culture in the area is the [[Kura-Araxes culture]], assigned to the period of ca. 4000 – 2200 BC, succeeded by the [[Trialeti culture]] (ca. 2200 – 1500 BC), the latter which is related to [[Georgians]]. The name ''Armenian'' was firstly recorded on an inscription which mentions ''Armani'' together with [[Ibla]], from territories conquered by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] (2300 BC) identified with an [[Akkadian]] colony in the current region of [[Diyarbekir]]. To this day the [[Assyrians]] still refer to the Armenians by the name ''Armani''.&lt;ref&gt;Martiros Kavoukjian, &quot;The Genesis of Armenian People&quot;, Montreal, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also thought to be related to the [[Mannaeans]] and to the biblical [[Mannaeans|Minni]].

The earliest forms of the word ''[[Name of Armenia|Hayastan]]'', an [[ethonym]] the Armenians (''Hayer'') use to designate their country, come from Hittite sources of the Late Bronze Age, such as the kingdom of [[Hayasa-Azzi]]. Another record mentioned by pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in the 33rd year of his reign (1446 BC) as the people of ''[[Name of Armenia|Ermenen]]'', and says in their land &quot;heaven rests upon its four pillars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, 1915 [http://holycall.com/biblemaps/minni.htm]; Eric H. Cline and David O'Connor (eds.) ''Thutmose III'', University of Michigan, 2006, ISBN 978-0-472-11467-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1500 – 1200 BC, the [[Hayasa-Azzi]] existed in the western half of the Armenian Highland, often clashing with the Hittite Empire. Between 1200 – 800 BC, much of Armenia was united under a confederation of kingdoms, which Assyrian sources called [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] (&quot;Land of Rivers&quot; in Assyrian&quot;).

===Iron Age===
{{main|Urartu}}

[[File:Urartu 743-en.svg|thumb|Urartu in the time of [[Sarduri II|Sarduris II]], 743 BC|300px]]
The [[Urartu|Kingdom of Urartu]] flourished in the [[Caucasus]] and eastern [[Asia Minor]] between the 9th century BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gis.net/~pldr/anech.html | title=Ancient Near East Chronology | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 585 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Urartu/Armenia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.livius.org/arl-arz/armenia/armenia.html | title= Urartu/Armenia | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Armenian Highland]]. The founder of the Urartian Kingdom, [[Aramu|Aramé]], united all the principalities of the Armenian Highland and gave himself the title &quot;King of Kings&quot;, the traditional title of Urartian Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.transanatolie.com/English/Turkey/Anatolia/urartu.htm | title= Transanatolie – Kings of Urartu | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urartians established their sovereignty over all of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] and [[Vaspurakan]]. The main rival of Urartu was the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://arcimaging.org/ | title= ArcImaging (Archeological Imaging Research Consortum) | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Sarduri I]] ([[834 BC|834]]–828 BC), Urartu had become a strong and organized state, and imposed taxes to neighbouring tribes. Sarduri made [[Tushpa]] (modern [[Van, Turkey|Van]]) the capital of Urartu. His son, [[Ishpuinis of Urartu|Ishpuinis]], extended the borders of the state by conquering what would later be known as the [[Tigranocerta]] area and by reaching [[Urmia]]. [[Menuas of Urartu|Menuas]] (810–785 BC) extended the Urartian territory up north, by spreading towards the Araratian fields. He left more than 90 inscriptions by using the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] scriptures in the [[Urartian language]]. [[Argishtis I of Urartu]] conquered [[Latakia]] from the Hittites, and reached [[Byblos]], [[Phoenicia]], and he built Erebuni, modern-day [[Yerevan]], in 782 BC by using 6600 prisoners of war.

In 714 BC, the [[Assyrians]] under [[Sargon II]] defeated the Urartian King [[Rusa I]] at [[Lake Urmia]] and destroyed the holy Urartian temple at [[Musasir]]. At the same time, an [[Indo-European]] tribe called the [[Cimmerians]] attacked [[Urartu]] from the northwest region and destroyed the rest of his armies.

The [[Medes]] under [[Cyaxares]] invaded Assyria later on in 612 BC, and then took over the Urartian capital of [[Van (Turkey)|Van]] towards 585 BC, effectively ending the sovereignty of Urartu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I&quot;&gt;{{hy icon}} {{cite book | last = Kurdoghlian |first = Mihran | title = Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume I | publisher = Hradaragoutioun Azkayin Oussoumnagan Khorhourti |year= 1994 | pages = 46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Armenian tradition, the Medes helped the Armenians establish the [[Orontid]] dynasty.

==Antiquity==

{{main|Orontid Dynasty}}

After the fall of Urartu around 585 BC, the [[Satrapy of Armenia]] was ruled by the Armenian [[Orontid Dynasty]], which governed the state in 585 – 190 BC. Under Orontids, Armenia at times was an independent kingdom, and at other times a [[satrapy]] of the Persian Empire. [[Darius III]] was an Armenian satrap before he became the emperor of Persia.

===Artaxiad dynasty===
{{main|Artaxiad Dynasty}}
After the destruction of the [[Seleucid Empire]], a Hellenistic Armenian state was founded in 190 BC.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Anahit.png|150px|thumb|left|Goddess [[Anahit]] in [[Hellenistic]] style with the likeness of Aphrodite, the brass head bronze sculpture (2nd/1st century BC) was found in the 19th century in the district of Yerznka (Satala) and is currently kept at the British Museum (a replica can be seen at the State History Museum of Armenia in [[Yerevan]]).]] --&gt;

It was a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]] successor state of [[Alexander the Great]]'s short-lived empire, with Artaxias becoming its first king and the founder of the Artaxiad dynasty (190 BC – AD 1).

At the same time, a western portion of the kingdom split as a separate state under Zariadris, which became known as [[Lesser Armenia]] while the main kingdom acquired the name of [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Greater Armenia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Urartu/Armenia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.livius.org/arl-arz/armenia/armenia.html | title= Urartu/Armenia | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new kings began a program of expansion which was to reach its zenith a century later. Their acquisitions are summarized by Strabo. Zariadris acquired [[Acilisene]] and the &quot;country around the Antitaurus&quot;, possibly the district of Muzur or west of the [[Euphrates]].

Artaxias took lands from the Medes, Iberians, and Syrians. He then had confrontations with [[Pontus]], Seleucid Syria and Cappadocia, and was included in the treaty which followed the victory of a group of Anatolian kings over Pharnaces of Pontus in 181 BC. Pharnaces thus abandoned all of his gains in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redgate |first = Elizabeth | title = The Armenians | publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year= 1998 | pages = 65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its zenith, from 95 to 66 BC, Greater Armenia extended its rule over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now eastern and central [[Turkey]], northwestern [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], forming the second Armenian empire. For a time, Armenia was one of the most powerful states in the Roman East.

It eventually confronted the [[Roman Republic]] in a war, which it lost in 66 BC, but nonetheless preserved its sovereignty. Tigranes continued to rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Fuller |first = J.F.C. | title = Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1991 | pages = 45 | isbn = 0-306-80422-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed the [[third Mithridatic war]] defeat of the King of Pontus by Roman [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompeius]] resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome.

Later on, in 1 AD, Armenia came under full [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] control until the establishment of the Armenian Arsacid dynasty. The [[Armenian people]] then adopted a Western political, philosophical, and religious orientation. According to Strabo, around this time everyone in Armenia spoke &quot;the same language.&quot; (Strabo 11.14.4).

===Roman Province of Armenia===
{{main|Roman Armenia}}
[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|right|thumb|250px|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with the &quot;Roman Province of Armenia&quot;]]
From [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompeius]]' campaign [[Armenia]] was, in part or whole, subject to the [[Roman Empire]] for nearly four centuries. Roman emperor [[Trajan]] created even a short-lived Province of Armenia between 114 and 117 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.it/books?id=jbS5KHJ4uqcC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=provincia+romana+di+armenia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oWf-uL7G0v&amp;sig=wYHGAI6aX8qhKYpOBk6X0z6gSsg&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=AL4iTJTTB8KB8gbVyoWqBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=provincia%20romana%20di%20armenia&amp;f=false Google Book: Cassio Dione and the Trajan &quot;Province of Armenia&quot; (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed Roman supremacy was fully established by the [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63|campaigns]] of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/15*.html Vahan Kurkjian: Armenia and the Romans]&lt;/ref&gt; that ended with a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] line would henceforth sit on the Armenian throne, but his nomination had to be approved by the Roman emperor.

Because this agreement was not respected by the Parthian Empire, in 114 [[Trajan]] from [[Antioch]]ia in Syria marched on Armenia and conquered the capital [[Artaxata]]. Trajan then deposed the Armenian king Partamasiri (imposed by the Parthians) and ordered the annexation of Armenia to the Roman Empire as a new province.

The new province reached the shores of the [[Caspian sea]] and bordered to the north with [[Caucasian Iberia]] and [[Caucasian Albania]], two vassal states of Rome. As a Roman province Armenia was administered by Catilius Severus of the [[Gens Claudia]].

After Trajan's death however, his successor [[Hadrian]] decided not to maintain the province of Armenia. In 118 AD, Hadrian gave Armenia up, and installed [[Parthamaspates]] as its &quot;vassal&quot; king.

===Arsacid dynasty===
{{main|Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia}}
[[File:Armenian4thcenturies.gif|thumb|250px|Armenia in the 4th Century, 299–387 A. D.]]
Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and [[Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/parthian.html | title= The Parthian Period | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians forced Armenia into submission from 37 to 47, when the Romans retook control of the kingdom.

Under [[Nero]], the Romans fought a [[Roman-Parthian War of 58–63|campaign (55–63)]] against the [[Parthian Empire]], which had invaded the kingdom of Armenia, allied to the Romans. After gaining (60) and losing (62) Armenia, the Romans under [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], [[legatus|legate]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] entered (63) into an agreement of [[Vologases I of Parthia]], which confirmed [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]] as king of Armenia, thus founding the [[Arshakuni Dynasty]].

The Arsacid dynasty lost control of Armenia for a few years when emperor [[Trajan]] created the &quot;Roman Province of Armenia&quot;, fully included into the [[Roman Empire]] from 114 to 117 AD. His successor [[Hadrian]] reinstalled the Arsacid Dynasty when nominated  [[Parthamaspates]] as &quot;vassal&quot; king of Armenia in 118 AD.

Another campaign was led by Emperor [[Lucius Verus]] in 162–165, after [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Sohaemus]], a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new [[client king]].&lt;ref&gt;HA Marcus Antoninus 9.1, Verus 7.1; Dio Cass. 71.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sassanid]] Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287. In 384 the kingdom was split between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] or [[East Roman]] Empire and the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/arm/arm_history.htm | title= Armenia: History | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Armenia quickly became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] under the name of [[Armenia Minor]]; Eastern Armenia remained a kingdom within Persia until 428, when the local nobility overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a governor in his place.

According to tradition, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] was established by two of Jesus' twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s--[[Saint Jude|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]—who preached Christianity in Armenia in the 40's-60's AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/early/armen.html | title= Church of Armenia | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Armenian Church was headed by patriarchs.

====Christianized Arsacid dynasty====

In 301, Armenia became the first nation to adopt [[Christianity]] as a state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_armenia.html | title= Information about Armenia on nationalgeographic.com | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established a church that today exists independently of both the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, having become so in 451 after having rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Thebes/1089/christology.html | title= Armenian Church History and Doctrine | accessdate=February 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090730103921/http://geocities.com/Athens/Thebes/1089/christology.html|archivedate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] is a part of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] communion, not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion. The first [[Catholicos of Armenia|Catholicos]] of the Armenian church was Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/religion/h_see_p1.html | title= The Holy City and the Mother Church of St. Etchmiadzin | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his beliefs, he was persecuted by the pagan king of Armenia, and was &quot;punished&quot; by being thrown in [[Khor Virap]], in modern-day Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.world66.com/europe/armenia/khorvirap | title= Khor Virap Travel Guide | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired the title of Illuminator, because he illuminated the spirits of Armenians by introducing Christianity to them.

During its later political eclipses, Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity.

In 405/406, Armenia's political future seemed to be uncertain. With the help of the King of Armenia, [[Mesrop Mashtots]] thus invented a unique alphabet to suit the people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.omniglot.com/writing/armenian.htm | title= Armenian alphabet, pronunciation and language | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, he ushered a new [[Golden Age of Armenia|Golden Age]] and strengthened the Armenian national identity and belongingness.

After years of partial rule, the Arsacid dynasty fell in 428, with Eastern Armenia being subjugated to Persia and Western Armenia, to Rome. In the 5th century, the Sassanid Shah Yazdegerd II tried to tie his Christian Armenian subjects more closely to the Sassanid Empire by imposing the [[Zoroastrian]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/ch22c.htm | title= The Sassanids, to 500 CE | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenians greatly resented this, and as a result, a rebellion broke out with Vartan Mamikonian as the leader of the rebels. Yazdegerd thus massed his army and sent it to Armenia, where the [[Battle of Avarayr]] took place in 451.

==Middle Ages==
{{main|Medieval Armenia}}

===Byzantium and Bagratid Armenia===
In 591, the Byzantine Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] defeated the Persians and recovered much of the remaining territory of Armenia into the empire. The conquest was completed by the Emperor [[Heraclius]], himself ethnically Armenian, in 629.

In 645, the Muslim Arab armies of the [[Caliphate]] had [[Arab conquest of Armenia|attacked and conquered the country]]. Armenia, which once had its own rulers and was at other times under Persian and Byzantine control, passed largely into the power of the Caliphs.

Nonetheless, there were still parts of Armenia held within the Empire, containing many Armenians. This population held tremendous power within the empire. The Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610–641) was of Armenian descent, as was the Emperor [[Philippicus]] (711–713). The Emperor [[Basil I]], who took the Byzantine throne in 867, was the first of what is sometimes called the Armenian dynasty (see [[Macedonian Dynasty]]), reflecting the strong effect the Armenians had on the Eastern [[Roman Empire|Roman]] State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9013608/Basil-I | title= Basil I in Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenians were able and allowed to maintain a distinct culture.

Evolving as a feudal kingdom in the 9th century, Armenia experienced a brief cultural, political and economic renewal under the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]]. Bagratid Armenia was eventually recognized as a sovereign kingdom by the two major powers in the region: Baghdad in 885, and Constantinople in 886. [[Ani]], the new Armenian capital, was constructed at the Kingdom's apogee in 964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Louvre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.louvre.fr/media/repository/ressources/sources/pdf/src_document_52304_v2_m56577569831159973.pdf | title= Armenia Sacra | accessdate=February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal capital at Ani held approximately 200,000 inhabitants and a reported &quot;1001 churches&quot;. With the construction of Ani, Armenia became a populous and prosperous nation, exerting political and economic influence over surrounding states and nations. Yet Armenia was still a weak state, perched precariously between the rival Byzantine Empire and the Abbassid Caliphate. Its existence depended on both of these states desiring the continuation of Bagratid Armenia as a buffer state, and Armenia itself being strong enough to maintain this status.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}} [[File:Bagratuni Armenia 1000-en.svg|thumb|Armenian Feudal Kingdoms, 1000 AD|230px]]

===Seljuq Armenia===
{{main|Seljuq Armenia}}
{{seealso|Battle of Manzikert}}
Although the native [[Bagratuni Dynasty]] was founded under favourable circumstances, the feudal system gradually weakened the country by eroding loyalty to the central government. Thus internally enfeebled, Armenia proved an easy victim for the Byzantines, who captured Ani in 1045. The [[Seljuk Turks]] under [[Alp Arslan]] in turn took the city in 1064.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://historymedren.about.com/od/aentries/a/11_alparslan.htm | title= Alp Arslan | accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1071, after the defeat of the Byzantine forces by the Seljuk Turks at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], the Turks captured the rest of Greater Armenia and much of [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Byzantium/byz_6.html | title= Byzantium and Its Influence on Neighboring Peoples | accessdate=February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; So ended Christian leadership of Armenia for the next millennium with the exception of a period of the late 12th-early 13th centuries, when the Muslim power in Greater Armenia was seriously troubled by the resurgent [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monarchy. Many local nobles (''nakharars'') joined their efforts with the [[Georgians]], leading to liberation of several areas in northern Armenia, which was ruled, under the authority of the Georgian crown, by the Zacharids/Mkhargrdzeli, a prominent Armeno-Georgian noble family.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbedrosian.com/appa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia===
{{main|Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia}}

[[File:Cilician Armenia-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Kingdom of Cilician Armenia, 1199–1375.]]
To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II]], King of [[Ani]], an Armenian named [[Ruben I of Armenia|Roupen]] with some of his countrymen went into the gorges of the Taurus Mountains and then into Tarsus of Cilicia. Here the Byzantine governor of the place gave them shelter. Thus, from around 1080 to 1375, the focus of Armenian nationalism moved south, as the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].

After the members of the first Crusade appeared in Asia Minor, the Armenians developed close ties to European [[Crusader States]], flourished in southeastern [[Asia Minor]] until it was conquered by [[Muslim]] states. Count [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]], who with the rest of the Crusaders was passing through Asia Minor bound for Jerusalem, left the Crusader army and was adopted by [[Thoros of Edessa]], an Armenian ruler of Greek Orthodox faith.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cilicia: A Historical Overview&quot;/&gt; Hostile as they were to the [[Seljuks]], and unfriendly to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the Armenians took kindly to the crusader count, and when Thoros was assassinated, Baldwin was made ruler of the new crusader [[County of Edessa]]. It seems that the Armenians enjoyed the rule of Baldwin and the crusaders in general, and some number of them fought alongside the crusaders. When [[Antioch]] had been taken (1097), Constantine, the son of Roupen, received from the crusaders the title of baron.

The failed [[Third Crusade]] and other events elsewhere left Cilicia as the sole substantial Christian presence in the Middle East.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cilicia: A Historical Overview&quot;/&gt; World powers, such as Byzantium, the Holy Roman Empire, the Papacy and even the [[Abbassid]] Caliph competed and vied for influence over the state and each raced to be the first to recognise [[Leo II of Armenia|Leo II]], Prince of Lesser Armenia, as the rightful king. As a result, he had been given a crown by both German and Byzantine emperors. Representatives from across Christendom and a number of Muslim states attended the coronation, thus highlighting the important stature that Cilicia had gained over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cilicia: A Historical Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.accc.org.uk/News/CILICIA/Cilicia%20-%20Little%20Armenia%20-%20%20by%20Ara%20Iskenderian.pdf | title= Cilicia: A Historical Overview | accessdate=February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian authority was often in touch with the crusaders. No doubt the Armenians aided in some of the other crusades. Cilicia flourished greatly under Armenian rule, as it became the last remnant of Medieval Armenian statehood.  {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Cilcia acquired an Armenian identity, as the kings of Cilicia were called kings of Armenians, not of Cilicians. In Lesser Armenia, Armenian culture was intertwined with both the European culture of the Crusaders, and with the Hellenic culture of Cilicia. As the Catholic families extended their influence over Cilicia, the Pope wanted the Armenians to follow Catholicism. This situation divided the kingdom's inhabitants between pro-Catholic and pro-Apostolic camps. Armenian sovereignty lasted till 1375, when the Mamelukes of Egypt profited from the unstable situation of Lesser Armenia and destroyed it.

==Early Modern period==

===Persian Armenia===
{{Main|Armenians in the Persian Empire}}

Due to its strategic significance, Armenia was constantly fought over and passed back and forth between the dominion of Persia and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].  At the height of the [[Ottoman-Persian wars]], [[Yerevan]] changed hands fourteen times between 1513 and 1737.

In 1604, [[Shah Abbas I]] pursued a scorched-earth campaign against the Ottomans in the Ararat valley. The old Armenian town of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] in the province of [[Nakhichevan]] was taken early in the invasion. From there Abbas' army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces.

While laying siege to [[Kars]], he learned of the approach of a large Ottoman army, commanded by Djghazadé [[Sinan Pasha]]. The order to withdraw was given; but to deny the enemy the potential to resupply themselves from the land, he ordered the wholesale destruction of the Armenian towns and farms on the plain. As part of this the whole population was ordered to accompany the Persian army in its withdrawal. Some 300,0000 people were duly herded to the banks of the [[Araxes River]].  Those who attempted to resist the mass deportation were killed outright.  The Shah had previously ordered the destruction of the only bridge, so people were forced into the waters, where a great many drowned, carried away by the currents, before reaching the opposite bank.  This was only the beginning of their ordeal. One eye-witness, Father de Guyan, describes the predicament of the refugees thus:

::''It was not only the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The greatest suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.''

Unable to maintain his army on the desolate plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Armies sent in pursuit of the Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported it is calculated that under half survived the march to [[Isfahan]]. In the conquered territories Abbas established the [[Erivan khanate]], a [[Muslim]] principality under the dominion of the [[Safavid Empire]]. [[Armenians]] formed less than 20% of its population&lt;ref name=&quot;hewsen&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Hewsen | first = Robert H. | title = Armenia: a historical atlas | year = 2001 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | isbn = 0-226-33228-4 | pages = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas I]]'s deportation of much of the Armenian population from the Ararat valley and the surrounding region in 1605.&lt;ref name=&quot;vonhaxthausen &quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = von Haxthausen | first = Baron | title = Transcaucasia: Sketches of the Nations and Races between the Black Sea and the Caspian | year = 2000 | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | isbn = 1-4021-8367-4 | pages = 252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often-used policy by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] was the appointment of [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] as local rulers. These were counted as subordinate to the [[Persian Empire]], but most of them had a ''de facto'' independence. Examples include: the [[Khanate of Erevan]], [[Khanate of Nakhichevan]] and the [[Karabakh Khanate]].

===Russian Armenia===
[[File:ArmenianOblast.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the [[Armenian Oblast]] within the [[Russian Empire]].]]

{{Main|Russian Armenia}}

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828]], the parts of historic Armenia under Persian control, centering on [[Yerevan]] and [[Lake Sevan]], were incorporated into [[Russia]]. Under Russian rule, the area corresponding approximately to modern-day Armenian territory was called &quot;Province of Yerevan&quot;. The Armenian subjects of the [[Russian Empire]] lived in relative safety, compared to their Ottoman kin, albeit clashes with [[Azeris|Tatars]] and [[Kurds]] were frequent in the early 20th century.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the ambitious Russians sought out to continue their expansion into Armenian land in order to reach the warm waters of the [[Mediterranean]]. This caused conflict between the Russian and Ottoman Empires eventually culminating in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829]]. In the aftermath of the war, the Ottoman Empire ceded a small part of the traditional Armenian homeland to the Russian Empire, known as Eastern Armenia following the while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman sovereignty.

===Ottoman Armenia===
{{Main|Ottoman Armenia}}
{{See also|Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople}}

[[File:Constantinople(1878)-Armenian patriarch.png|thumb|200px|Patriarch [[Harutyun I]] of [[Constantinople]].]]
[[Mehmed II]] conquered [[Constantinople]] from the Byzantines in 1453, and made it the Ottoman Empire's capital. Mehmed and his successors used the religious systems of their subject nationalities as a method of population control, and so Ottoman Sultans invited an Armenian archbishop to establish the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Armenians of Constantinople grew in numbers, and became respected, if not full, members of Ottoman society.

The Ottoman Empire ruled in accordance to [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. As such, the [[People of the Book]] (the [[Christianity|Christians]] and the [[Judaism|Jews]]) had to pay an extra tax to fulfill their status as [[dhimmi]] and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy. While the [[Armenians]] of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] benefitted from the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan's]] support and grew to be a prospering community, the same could not be said about the ones inhabiting [[Armenian Highland|historic Armenia]]. During times of crisis the ones in the remote regions of mountainous [[eastern Anatolia]] were mistreated by local [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chiefs and feudal lords. They often also had to suffer (alongside the settled Muslim population) raids by nomadic Kurdish tribes.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Justin: ''The Ottoman Peoples and the end of Empire''; London, 1981; p.63&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenians]], like the other Ottoman Christians (though not to the same extent), had to transfer some of their healthy male children to the Sultan's government due to the [[devşirme]] policies in place. The boys were then forced to convert to Islam (by threat of death otherwise) and educated to be fierce warriors in times of war, as well as [[Bey]]s, [[Pasha]]s and even [[Grand Vizier]]s in times of peace.

The Armenian national liberation movement was the [[Armenians|Armenian]] effort to free the [[Armenian Highland|historic Armenian homeland]] of eastern [[Anatolia]] and [[Transcaucasus]] from [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination and re-establish the independent [[Armenia|Armenian state]]. The national liberation movement of the [[History of the Balkans#National Awakening in the Balkans|Balkan peoples]] and the immediate involvement of the European powers in the Eastern question had a powerful effect on the development of the national liberation ideology movement among the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians of the Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;British Diplomacy and the Armenian Question: From the 1830s to 1914 By Arman J. Kirakossian page 58&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian national movement, besides its individual heroes, was an organized activity represented around three parties of Armenian people, [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]], [[Armenakan Party|Armenakan]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], which ARF was the largest and most influential among the three. Those Armenians who did not support national liberation aspirations or who were neutral were called ''chezoks''.

In 1839, the situation of the Ottoman Armenians slightly improved after [[Abdul Mejid I]] carried out [[Tanzimat]] reforms in its territories. However, later Sultans, such as [[Abdul Hamid II]] stopped the reforms and carried out massacres, now known as the [[Hamidian massacres]] of 1895–96 after a failed Armenian attempt to assassinate him.

==Twentieth century==

===The Armenian Genocide(1915–1917)===
{{main|Armenian Genocide}}
[[File:Marcharmenians.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Armenian civilians, being deported during the [[Armenian Genocide]].]]
In 1915, the Ottoman Empire systematically carried out the [[Armenian Genocide]]. This was preceded by a wave of massacres in the years 1894 to 1896, and another one [[Adana massacre|in 1909 in Adana]]. In 1915, with [[World War I]] in progress, the Ottoman Turks accused the (Christian) Armenians as liable to ally with [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], and treated the entire Armenian population as an enemy within their empire.

The events of 1915 to 1923 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were the result of a [[civil war]] coupled with disease and [[famine]], with casualties incurred by both sides.

The exact numbers of deaths is hard to establish. It is estimated by many sources that close to a million and a half Armenians perished in camps, which excludes Armenians who may have died in other ways. Most estimates place the total number of deaths between 600,000 (by Turkish authorities) and 1,500,000 (by Western academics).These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on April 24, the Armenian Christian martyr day.

This horrific ethnic cleansing done by the [[İttihat ve Terakki]] were not only done to [[Armenians]], ethnic cleansing regimes were also carried on to the Greeks and Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;armenianhighland.com&lt;/ref&gt; This act of ethnic cleansing was done by the Ottoman Turks to &quot;turkify&quot; the Ottoman Empire completely. These acts were done not only from 1915 till 1918, but before and after as well.

===Democratic Republic of Armenia (1918–1922)===
{{main|Democratic Republic of Armenia}}

Between the 4th and 19th centuries, the traditional area of Armenia was conquered and ruled by [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Arab]]s, [[Mongolia|Mongols]], and [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], among others. Parts of historical Armenia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire after the collapse of these two empires in the wake of the [[First World War]].

==== Transcaucasian Federation (1917–1918) ====
{{See also|Caucasus Campaign}}
[[File:Flag of the Transcaucasian Federation.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]]]]
During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the provinces of the [[Caucasus]] seceded and formed their own federal state called the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]]. Competing national interests and war with [[Turkey]] led to the dissolution of the republic half a year later, in April 1918.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the takeover of the [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Stepan Shaumyan]] was placed in charge of Russian Armenia. In September 1917 the convention in Tiflis elected the [[Armenian National Council of Tiflis|Armenian National Council]], the first sovereign political body of Armenians since the collapse of Lesser Armenia in 1375. Meanwhile, both the Ittihad (Unionist) and the Nationalists moved to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] sent several delegations to Moscow in an attempt to win some support for his own post-Ottoman movement in what he saw as a modernised ethno-nationalist Turkey. This alliance proved disastrous for the Armenians. The signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (January 1, 1918), helped [[Vehib Pasha]] to attack the new Republic. Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Republic was forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum. In the end, the Republic had to evacuate Erzurum as well.

Further southeast, in Van, the Armenians resisted the Turkish army until April 1918, but eventually were forced to evacuate it and withdraw to Persia. Conditions deteriorated when Azerbaijani Tatars sided with the Turks and seized the Armenian's lines of communication, thus cutting off the Armenian National Councils in Baku and Yerevan from the National Council in Tiflis.

The [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA) was established in Erevan on May 28, 1918.

=== Georgian-Armenian War (1918) ===
{{main|Georgian-Armenian War 1918|Democratic Republic of Georgia|Democratic Republic of Armenia}}
[[File:D R Armenia.png|thumb|right|200px|Democratic Republic of Armenia in 1919]]
During the final stages of [[World War I]], the Armenians and Georgians had been defending against the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In June 1918, in order to forestall an Ottoman advance on [[Tiflis]], the Georgian troops had occupied  the [[Lori Province]] which at the time had a 75% Armenian majority. After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. Georgian [[Menshevik]] parlementarian [[Irakli Tsereteli]] offered that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference including Georgia, Armenia, [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] in order to resolve the issue which the Armenians rejected. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of [[Odzun|Uzunlar]] in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;Armenian the Survival of a Nation, Christopher Walker pg 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgian-Armenian War]] was a border war fought in 1918 between the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] over the parts of then disputed provinces of [[Lori]], [[Javakheti]] which had been historically bicultural Armenian-Georgian territories, but were largely populated by Armenians in the 19th century.

====Armenian-Azerbaijan War====
{{Main|Armenian–Azerbaijani War}}
A considerable degree of hostility existed between Armenia and its new neighbor to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]], stemming largely from to racial, religious, cultural and societal differences. The Azeris had close ethnic and religious ties to the Turks and had provided material support for them in their drive to [[Baku]] in 1918. Although the borders of the two countries were still undefined, Azerbaijan claimed most of the territory Armenia was sitting on, demanding all or most parts of the former Russian provinces of [[Elizavetpol]], [[Tiflis]], [[Yerevan]], [[Kars Oblast|Kars]] and [[Batum]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. II'', p. 192, map 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As diplomacy failed to accomplish compromise, even with the mediation of the commanders of a British expeditionary force that had installed itself in the Caucasus, territorial clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan took place throughout 1919 and 1920, most notably in the regions of [[Nakhichevan]], [[Karabakh]] and [[Syunik]] (Zangezur). Repeated attempts to bring these provinces under Azerbaijani jurisdiction were met with fierce resistance by their Armenian inhabitants. In May 1919, Dro led an expeditionary unit that was successful in establishing Armenian administrative control in [[Nakhichevan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. I'', pp. 243–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South West Caucasian Republic====
While problems with Azerbaijan continued, a new state headed by [[Fakhr al-Din Pirioghlu]] and centered in [[Kars]], the [[South West Caucasian Republic]] was established. It claimed the territory around the regions of Kars and [[Batum]], parts of the Yerevan district and the [[Akhaltsikhe]] and [[Akhalkalaki]] districts of the [[Tiflis]] province. It existed alongside with the British general governorship created during the Entente's intervention in Transcaucasia.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. I'', pp. 205–214.&lt;/ref&gt; It was abolished by British High Commissioner Admiral [[Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe]] in April 1919 and the region was assigned to the Armenian Republic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Treaty of Sèvres ====

The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] was signed between the Allied and Associated Powers and [[Ottoman Empire]] at [[Sèvres]], [[France]] on August 10, 1920. The treaty included a clause on Armenia: it made all parties signing the treaty recognize [[Armenia]] as a free and independent state. The drawing of definite borders was, however, left to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the United States State Department, and was only presented to Armenia on November 22. The new borders gave Armenia access to the Black Sea and awarded large portions of the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire to the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Turkish-Armenian War (1920) ====
[[File:Armenians fleeing Kars.jpg|right|thumb|Armenian civilians fleeing [[Kars]] after its capture by [[Kâzım Karabekir|Kazım Karabekir]]'s forces]]
{{details|Turkish-Armenian War}}
In 1920, Armenian border troops skirmished with Muslim warlords in the former Georgian region of [[Oltu]], on the border with the DRA. Turkish General [[Kazım Karabekir]] then led four Turkish battalions into the district on September 3 and drove the Armenians out.
The Turkish Revolutionaries alleged that the Turks inside DRA were being mistreated and oppressed by the Armenians. On September 20, 1920, the Turkish General [[Kazım Karabekir]] invaded the region of [[Sarıkamış|Sarikamish]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 184–197.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Armenia declared war on Turkey on September 24 and the [[Turkish invasion of Armenia (1920)]] began. In the regions of [[Oltu]], Sarikamish, [[Kars]], [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]] (Gyumri) Armenian forces clashed with those of Karabekir’s armies. [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] had sent several delegations to Moscow in search of an alliance, where he had found a receptive response by the Soviet government, which started sending gold and weapons to the [[Turkish revolutionaries]]. This proved disastrous for the Armenians. 

Armenia gave way to [[communism|communist]] power in late 1920. In November 1920, the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] captured Alexandropol and were poised to move in on the capital. A cease fire was concluded on November 18. Negotiations were then carried out between Karabekir and a peace delegation led by Alexander Khatisian in Alexandropol; although Karabekir’s terms were extremely harsh the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. The [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] was thus signed on December 2/3, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 394–396.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The consequences of the DRA's war with Turkey were severe. In the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]], the young Armenian republic was to disarm most of its military forces, cede more than 50% of its pre-war territory, and to give up all the territories granted to it at the Treaty of Sèvres.

[[File:11thRedArmyYerevan.jpg|thumb|240px|Members of the Soviet [[11th Red Army]] marching down Yerevan's Abovyan Boulevard, effectively ending Armenian self-rule.]]
However, as the terms of defeat were being negotiated, Bolshevik [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]] invaded the DRA from Azerbaijan in order to establish a new pro-Bolshevik government in the country.
The [[11th Red Army]] began its virtually unopposed advance into Armenia on November 29, 1920 at  [[Ijevan|Karavansarai]]. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in [[Yerevan]]. The Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum, presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary [[Boris Legran]]. Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, protect the Armenians and to not pursue non-communist Armenians, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (''[[Revkom]]'', made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan) also entered the city.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV'', pp. 373ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on the following day, December 6, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s [[Cheka]], entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending the existence of the Democratic Republic of Armenia.  At that point what was left of Armenia was under the influence of the [[Bolsheviks]].

Although the Bolsheviks succeeded in ousting the Turks from their positions in Armenia, they decided to establish peace with Turkey. In 1921, the Bolsheviks and the Turks signed the [[Treaty of Kars]], in which Turkey ceded [[Adjara]] to the USSR in exchange for the Kars territory (today the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Iğdır Province|Iğdır]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]). The land given to Turkey included the ancient city of [[Ani]] and [[Mount Ararat]], the spiritual Armenian homeland. In 1922, the newly-proclaimed [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], under the leadership of [[Aleksandr Myasnikyan|Alexander Miasnikyan]], became part of the [[Soviet Union]] as one of three republics comprising the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]].

===Armenia in the Soviet Union (1922–1991)===
{{Main|Armenian SSR}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Armenian SSR.png|thumb|right|The coat of arms of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] depicting [[Mount Ararat]] in the center.]]
The Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved in 1936 and as a result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the [[Armenian SSR|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The transition to [[communism]] was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no [[freedom of speech]], even less so under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing [[nationalist]] [[rhetoric]] or elements in their works were labeled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to [[Siberia]] during Stalinist rule. Even [[Zabel Yesayan|Zabel Yessayan]], a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the [[Armenian Genocide]], was quickly exiled to Siberia after repatriating to Armenia from [[France]].

Soviet Armenia participated in [[World War II]] by sending hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the frontline in order to defend the &quot;Soviet motherland.&quot;
Soviet rule also had some positive aspects.  Armenia benefited from the Soviet economy, especially when it was at its apex. Provincial villages gradually became towns and towns gradually became cities. Peace between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] was reached, albeit temporarily. During this time, Armenia had a sizeable Azeri minority, mostly centred in [[Yerevan]]. Likewise, Azerbaijan had an Armenian minority, concentrated in [[Baku]], [[Kirovabad]], and [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. This demographic would change dramatically during and after the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]].

Many Armenians still had nationalist sentiments, even though they were discouraged from expressing them publicly. On April 24, 1965, tens of thousands of Armenians flooded the streets of Yerevan to remind the world of the horrors that their parents and grandparents endured during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. This was the first public demonstration of such high numbers in the [[USSR]], which defended national interests rather than collective ones. In the late 1980s, Armenia was suffering from pollution. With [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s introduction of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], public demonstrations became more common. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan because of the USSR's inability to address simple ecological concerns. Later on, with the conflict in [[Karabakh]], the demonstrations obtained a more nationalistic flavour. Many Armenians began to demand statehood.

In 1988, the [[Spitak Earthquake]] killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed multiple towns in northern Armenia, such as [[Gyumri|Leninakan]] (modern-day [[Gyumri]]) and [[Spitak]]. Many families were left without electricity and running water. The harsh situation caused by the earthquake and subsequent events made many residents of Armenia leave and settle in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]] or [[Australia]].

On February 20, 1988, interethnic fighting between the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijanis broke out shortly after the parliament of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]] pitted Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by Armenia, against the [[Army of Azerbaijan]].

==Independent Armenia (1991-today)==
[[File:DistributionOfArmeniansInTheCaucasus.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of Armenians in the Caucasus]]
[[Armenia]] declared its sovereignty from the [[Soviet Union]] on August 23, 1990. In the wake of the [[August Coup]], a [[referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. Following an overwhelming vote in favor, full independence was declared on September 21, 1991. However, widespread recognition did not occur until the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991.

Armenia faced many challenges during its first years as a [[sovereign state]]. Several Armenian organizations from around the world quickly arrived to offer aid and to participate in the country's early years.  From Canada, a group of young students and volunteers under the [[CYMA - Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia]] banner arrived in Ararat Region and became the first youth organization to contribute to the newly independent Republic.  

Following the Armenian victory in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]], both [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]] closed their borders and imposed a blockade which they retain to this day, though in October 2009 Turkey and Armenia signed a treaty to normalize relations. These events severely affected the economy of the fledgling republic, and closed off its main routes to [[Europe]].

===Ter-Petrosyan Presidency (1991–1998)===
[[File:Levon Ter Petrossian.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]]]]
[[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] was popularly elected the first President of the newly-independent Republic of Armenia on October 16, 1991 and re-elected on September 22, 1996. His re-election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. His popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia's post-Soviet economy was in. He was also unpopular with one party in particular, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], which he banned and jailed its leadership, on the grounds that the party had a foreign-based leadership—something which was forbidden according to the Armenian Constitution.

Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating compromised settlement of the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan's key ministers, led by then-Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and [[Azerbaijan]], called for a &quot;phased&quot; settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh's status, the main stumbling block. That agreement was to accompany the return of most Armenian-controlled Azerbaijani territories around Karabakh and the lifting of the [[Azerbaijan]]i and [[Turkey|Turkish]] blockades of Armenia{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

===Kocharyan Presidency (1998–2008)===
[[File:Robert Kocharyan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Robert Kocharyan]]]]
After the  resignation of his predecessor [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], [[Robert Kocharyan]] was elected Armenia's second President on March 30, 1998, defeating his main rival, [[Karen Demirchyan]], in an [[Armenian presidential election, 1998|early presidential election marred by irregularities and violations]] by both sides as reported by international electoral observers. Complaints included that Kocharyan had not been an Armenian citizen for ten years as required by the constitution.,&lt;ref name=&quot;resign&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/s/w_asia/52898.stm Staff (February 4, 1998) &quot;Armenian president resigns&quot; ''BBC World Service'']&lt;/ref&gt; even though it would have been impossible for him to be a 10 year citizen of a republic that was less than 7 years old; however, the Armenian constitution recognized the Armenian SSR as it predecessor state.

During his presidency, several opposition leaders in the Armenian Parliament and the Prime Minister of Armenia were killed by gunmen in an episode known as the [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting]]. Kocharyan himself negotiated with terrorists to lease the MP hostages. It is widely believed by Armenians at large that Kocharyan is responsible for the parliament shooting{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

The [[Armenian presidential election, 2003|2003 Armenian Presidential election]] were held on February 19 and March 5, 2003. No candidate received a majority in the first round of the election with the [[incumbent]] President Kocharyan winning slightly under 50% of the vote. Therefore a second round was held and Kocharyan defeated [[Stepan Demirchyan]] with official results showed him winning just over 67% of the vote.
In both rounds, electoral observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] reported significant amounts of [[electoral fraud]] by Demirchyan's supporters and numerous supporters of Demirchyan were arrested before the second round took place.&lt;ref name=flawed&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Stern | title = Anger at 'flawed' poll in Armenia | publisher = [[Financial Times]] | page = 4 | date = March 7, 2003 | accessdate =May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Demirchyan described the election as having been rigged and called on his supporters to rally against the results.&lt;ref name=incumbent&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2820893.stm | title = Incumbent 'wins' Armenia vote | accessdate =May 23, 2009 | date = March 6, 2003 | publisher = ''[[BBC Online]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of Armenians protested in the days after the election against the results and called on President Kocharyan to step down.&lt;ref name=flawed/&gt; However Kocharyn was sworn in for a second term in early April and the [[constitutional court]] upheld the election, while recommending that a [[referendum]] be held within a year to confirm the election result.&lt;ref name=sworn&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/world/world-briefing-asia-armenia-president-sworn-in-amid-protests.html?fta=y | title = World Briefing | Asia: Armenia: President Sworn In Amid Protests | accessdate =May 23, 2009 | date = April 10, 2003 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=constitutional&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav042303.shtml | title = Constitutional court stirs Armenian politicial controversy | accessdate =May 23, 2009 | date = April 23, 2003 | publisher = ''Eurasianet.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As President, Kocharyan continued to negotiate a peaceful resolution with Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]] on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.  Talks between Aliyev and Kocharyan were held in September 2004 in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]], on the sidelines of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] summit.  Reportedly, one of the suggestions put forward was the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Azeri territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh, and holding [[referendum]]s (plebiscites) in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper regarding the future status of the region. On February 10–11, 2006, Kocharyan and Aliyev met in [[Rambouillet]], [[France]] to discuss the fundamental principles of a settlement to the conflict, including the withdrawal of troops, formation of international peace keeping troops, and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghazinyan&quot;&gt;[http://armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=1346&amp;CID=1511&amp;IID=&amp;lng=eng  Ghazinyan, Aris (February 10, 2006) &quot;Drawing the Line: Maps meet principles in the search for a settlement over Nagorno Karabakh&quot; ''Armenia Now'']&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the initial optimism, the Rambouillet talks did not produce any agreement, with key issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and whether Armenian troops would withdraw from [[Kalbajar]] still being contentious.

=== Sargsyan Presidency (2008) ===
[[File:Serzh Sargsyan cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Serzh Sargsyan]]]] [[Serzh Sargsyan]], then [[Prime Minister of Armenia]] and having President Kocharyan's backing, was viewed as the strongest contender for the post of the President of Armenia in the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|February 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=3 The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia (November 27, 2005), Chapter 3: The President of the Republic, Article 50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.am/en/politics/2007/09/14/teknatsu/ Robert Kocharyan To Support Serzh Sargsyan, Panorama.am]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ter-Petrosyan officially announced his candidacy in the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] in a speech in Yerevan on October 26, 2007. He accused Kocharyan's government of massive corruption, involving the theft of &quot;at least three to four billion dollars&quot; over the previous five years. He was critical of the government's claims of strong economic growth and argued that Kocharyan and his Prime Minister, [[Serge Sargsyan]], had come to accept a solution to the problem of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] that was effectively the same solution that he had proposed ten years earlier. A number of opposition parties have rallied behind him since his return to the political arena, including the [[People's Party of Armenia]] led by [[Stepan Demirchian]], Armenian Republic Party led by [[Aram Sargsyan]],&lt;ref&gt;Emil Danielian and Liz Fuller, [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/fc64b5fb-efac-4463-8e9f-13b3d6fd1714.html &quot;Armenian Ex-President Confirms Comeback Plans&quot;], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, November 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]], &quot;Azadakrum&quot; movement for [[Jirair Sefilian]], &quot;New Times&quot; Party and the [[Heritage (Armenia)|Heritage Party]], led by [[Raffi Hovannisian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payqar.org/am/1/ Payqar newspaper]; see also http://azadakrum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Final results from the election, which was held on February 19, 2008, officially showed Sargsyan winning about 53% of the vote, and Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 21.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/20/content_7637405.htm &quot;Sargsyan wins Armenian presidential race&quot;], Xinhua, February 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ter-Petrosyan and his supporters accused the government of rigging the election and claimed victory;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/19/europe/EU-POL-Armenia-Presidential-Election.php &quot;Armenian opposition candidate accuses prime minister of election violations&quot;], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), February 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning on February 20, he led [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|continuous protests]] involving tens of thousands of his supporters in Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/21/europe/EU-POL-Armenia-Presidential-Election.php &quot;Thousands challenge victory of Armenian PM in presidential vote in 2nd day of protests&quot;], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), February 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the early morning of March 1, reportedly acting on evidence of firearms in the camp, the authorities moved in to inspect the tents set up by demonstrators. Law enforcement agents then violently dispersed the hundreds of protestors camped in.  Ter-Petrosyan was placed under de facto house arrest, not being allowed to leave his home, though the authorities later denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/FFAB3C6D-A75D-4E48-B0D6-5D3A83069160.ASP Ter-Petrosyan ‘Under House Arrest,’ Rally Broken Up, ''Radio Liberty'']&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, tens of thousands of protestors or more gathered at Miyasnikyan Square to protest the government's act.  Police, overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd, pulled out.  A state of emergency was implemented by President Kocharyan at 5pm, allowing the army to be moved into the capital.  At night, a few thousand protestors barricaded themselves using commandeered municipal buses. As a result of skirmishes with the police, ten people died, including policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/03/7D25D2BD-9268-4233-A631-BF5F29FD5BCE.html &quot;Armenia: Eight Killed After Clashes Between Police, Protesters&quot;], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by mass arrests and purges of prominent members of the opposition, as well as a ''de facto ban'' on any further anti-government protests. Sargsyan was recognized as legitimate president &lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/02/armeni18189.htm &quot;Armenia: Police Beat Peaceful Protesters in Yerevan&quot;], [[Human Rights Watch]] (NY), March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLibMar1a&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/FFAB3C6D-A75D-4E48-B0D6-5D3A83069160.ASP Ter-Petrosyan ‘Under House Arrest,’ Rally Broken Up], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2009, the [[Turkish-Armenian protocols]] on the establishment of diplomatic relations constituted a novelty in Turkish-Armenian relations. Sargsyan accepted the proposal of studying the issue of the Armenian genocide through a commission, and recognized the current Turkish-Armenian border.

In 2009–2010, the [[Azerbaijan]]'s military buildup along with increasing war rhetoric and threats risked causing renewed problems in the [[South Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by President Serzh Sargsyan at the General Debate of the 63 rd session of the general assembly|url=http://www.president.am/events/statements/eng/?id=19|work=President.am|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[2011 Armenian protests|protests]] erupted in Armenia as part of the [[revolutionary wave]] [[arab Spring|sweeping]] through the [[Middle East]]. Protesters continue to demand an investigation into the 2008 violence, the release of political prisoners, an improvement in socioeconomic conditions, and the institution of democratic reforms. The [[Armenian National Congress]] and [[Heritage (Armenia)|Heritage]] have been influential in organizing and leading protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63098 Armenia: Opposition Bypasses Police, Stages Rally in Freedom Square]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary history==
{{further|History of Armenia (Moses of Chorene)}}
The legendary founder of [[Armenia]] was [[Hayk]], a chieftain who called on his kinsmen to unite into a single nation, thus forming Armenia. [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]] was the mountain around which was centered Urartu and subsequent kingdoms, and is still considered sacred by the Armenians.

The original Armenian name for the country was Hayq, later Hayastan, translated as the land of [[Hayk]], and consisting of the name Haik and the Iranian suffix '-stan' (land). According to legend, Haik was a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]] (son of Togarmah, who was a son of Gomer, a son of Noah's son, Yafet), and according to tradition, a forefather of all Armenians. Mount Ararat, a sacred mountain for the Armenian people, rising in the center of the [[Armenian Highland]] as its highest peak, is traditionally considered the landing place of [[Noah]]'s Ark.
