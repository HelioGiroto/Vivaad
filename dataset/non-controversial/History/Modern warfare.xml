{{history of war}}

'''Modern warfare''', although present in every [[historical period]] of [[military history]], is generally used to refer to the concepts, methods and [[military technology|technologies]] that have come into use during and after the [[Second World War]] and the [[Korean War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The concepts and methods have assumed more complex forms of the 19th- and early-20th-century antecedents, largely due to the widespread use of highly advanced [[information technology]], and modern armies must modernize constantly to preserve their battleworthiness.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Creveld | first1 = Martin Van | title = The Oxford History of Modern War | chapter = Technology and War I:To 1945| editors = Charles Townshend | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York, USA | pages = 206  | isbn = 0-19-285373-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[total war]] was thought to be the form of international conflicts from the experience of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] to the Second World War, the term no longer describes warfare in which countries or nations use all of their resources to destroy another country's or nation's organized ability to engage in war. The practice of total war which had been in use for over a century, as a form of war policy, has been changed dramatically with greater awareness of [[military tactics|tactical]], [[operational mobility|operational]] and [[military strategy|strategic]] battle information.


War in modern times has been the inclusion of [[civilian]]s and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying a country's ability to engage in war.  The targeting of civilians developed from two distinct [[theory|theories]].  The first theory was that if enough civilians were killed, factories could not function.  The second theory was that if civilians were killed, the country would be so demoralized that it would have no ability to wage further war. However
UNICEF reports that civilian fatalities are down from 20 percent prior to 1900 AD to less than 5 percent of fatalities in the wars beginning in the 1990s.

With the advent  of [[nuclear weapons]], the concept of full-scale war carries the prospect of [[global annihilation]], and as such conflicts since WWII have by definition been &quot;low intensity&quot; conflicts,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Creveld | first1 = Martin Van | title = The Oxford History of Modern War | chapter = Technology and War II:Postmodern War? | editors = Charles Townshend  | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically in the form of [[proxy war]]s fought within local regional confines, using what are now referred to as &quot;[[conventional weapons]],&quot; typically combined with the use of [[asymmetric warfare]] tactics and applied use of [[intelligence]].

More recently the US Department of Defense introduced a concept of [[Battlespace]] as the integrated information management of all significant factors that impact on combat operations by [[armed forces]] for the [[military]] [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of operations]], including [[Information warfare|information]], [[Aerial warfare|air]], [[Ground warfare|land]], [[Naval warfare|sea]] and [[Space warfare|space]]. It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly forces; facilities, weather and terrain within the operational areas and areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/b/00692.html US DOD dictionary - battlespace]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Some argue that the changing forms of three-dimensional warfare represents nothing more than an evolution of [[technology during World War I|earlier technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Asymmetric===
{{main|Asymmetric warfare}}
A military situation in which two belligerents of unequal strength interact and take advantage of their respective strengths and weaknesses. This interaction often involves strategies and tactics outside the bounds of conventional warfare, often referred to as
terrorism.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological warfare}}

Biological warfare, also known as germ warfare, is the use of any organism (bacteria, virus or other disease-causing organism) or toxin found in nature, as a weapon of war. It is meant to incapacitate or kill an adversary. It may also be defined as the employment of biological agents to produce casualties in man or animals and damage to plants or material; or defense against such employment.

===Chemical===
{{main|Chemical warfare}}

Chemical warfare is warfare (associated military operations) using the toxic properties of chemical substances to kill, injure or incapacitate an enemy.

===Electronic===
{{main|Electronic warfare}}

[[Electronic warfare]] refers to mainly non-violent practices used chiefly to support other areas of warfare. The term was originally coined to encompass the interception and [[Code|decoding]] of enemy [[radio communications]], and the communications technologies and [[cryptography]] methods used to counter such interception, as well as [[Radio jamming|jamming]], radio stealth and other related areas. Over the later years of the 20th century and early years of the 21st century this has expanded to cover a wide range of areas: the use of, detection of and avoidance of detection by [[radar]] and [[sonar]] systems, [[hack (technology slang)|computer hacking]], etc.

===Fourth generation===
{{main|Fourth generation warfare}}

[[Fourth generation warfare]] (4GW) is a concept defined by [[William S. Lind]] and expanded by [[Thomas X. Hammes]], used to describe the [[decentralized]] nature of modern warfare. The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent ideological network. Fourth Generation wars are characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics, soldier and civilian, conflict and peace, battlefield and safety.

While this term is similar to terrorism and asymmetric warfare, it is much narrower. Classical insurgencies and the Indian Wars are examples of Pre-Modern War, not 4GW. Fourth generation warfare usually has the insurgency group or non-state side trying to implement their own government or reestablish an old government over the one currently running the territory.  The blurring of lines between state and non-state is further complicated in a democracy by the power of the [[News media|media]].

===Ground===
{{main|Land warfare}}

[[Ground warfare]] involves three types of combat units, [[Infantry]], [[Armoured warfare|Armor]] and [[Artillery]].

[[Infantry]] in modern times would consist of [[Mechanized infantry]] and [[Airborne forces]]. Usually having a type of rifle or sub-machine gun, an infantryman is the basic unit of an army.

[[Armored warfare]] in modern times involves a variety of [[Armored fighting vehicle]]s for the purpose of battle and support. Tanks or other armored vehicles (such as armored personnel carriers or tank destroyers) are slower, yet stronger hunks of metal. They are invulnerable to enemy machine gun fire but prone to rocket infantry, mines, and aircraft so are usually accompanied by infantry. In urban areas, because of smaller space, an armored vehicle is exposed to hidden enemy infantry but as the so called &quot;Thunder Run&quot; at Baghdad in 2003 showed, armored vehicles can play a critical role in urban combat. In rural areas, an armored vehicle does not have to worry about hidden units though muddy and damp terrain have always been a factor of weakness for Armored tanks and vehicles.

[[Artillery]] in contemporary times, is distinguished by its large calibre, firing an [[explosive]] [[shell (projectile)|shell]] or [[rocket]], and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized mount for firing and transport. Weapons covered by this term include &quot;tube&quot; artillery such as the [[howitzer]], [[cannon]], [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and [[field gun]] and [[rocket artillery|&quot;rocket&quot; artillery]].  The term &quot;artillery&quot; has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal [[guidance systems]], even though some artillery units employ surface-to-surface [[missile]]s. Recent advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large calibre shells to be fitted with precision guidance fuses, blurring this distinction.

===Guerrilla===
{{main|Guerrilla warfare}}
[[Guerrilla warfare]] is defined as fighting by groups of [[irregular military|irregular]] troops (guerrillas) within areas occupied by the enemy. When guerrillas obey the laws of conventional warfare they are entitled, if captured, to be treated as ordinary prisoners of war; however, they are often executed by their captors. The tactics of guerrilla warfare stress deception and ambush, as opposed to mass confrontation, and succeed best in an irregular, rugged, terrain and with a sympathetic populace, whom guerrillas often seek to win over or dominate by propaganda, reform, and [[terrorism]]. Guerrilla warfare has played a significant role in modern history, especially when waged by Communist liberation movements in Southeast Asia (most notably in the [[Vietnam War]]) and elsewhere.

Guerrilla fighters gravitate toward weapons which are easily accessible, low in technology and low in cost.  A typical arsenal of the modern guerrilla would include the [[AK-47]], [[Rocket propelled grenade|RPG]]s and [[Improvised explosive device]]s. The guerrilla doctrines' main disadvantage is the inability to access more advanced equipment due to economic, influence, and accessibility issues.  They must rely on small unit tactics involving hit and run.  This situation leads to low intensity warfare, [[asymmetrical warfare]] and [[war among the people]]. The rules of Guerrilla warfare are to fight a little and then to retreat.

===Intelligence===
'''Propaganda'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is an ancient form of disinformation concerted with sending a set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of large numbers of people. Instead of impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience. The most effective propaganda is often completely truthful, but some propaganda presents facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis, or gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience.

'''Psychological'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Psychological warfare}}
[[Psychological warfare]] had its beginnings during the campaigns of Genghis Khan through the allowance of certain civilians of the nations, cities, and villages to flee said place, spreading terror and fear to neighboring principalities. [[Psychological]] actions have the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives.

'''Information'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{main|Information warfare}}
Made possible by the widespread use of the electronic media during the [[Second World War]], [[Information warfare]] is a kind of warfare where [[information]] and attacks on information and its system are used as a tool of [[war]]fare. Some examples of this type of warfare are electronic &quot;sniffers&quot; which disrupt international fund-transfer networks as well as the signals of [[television]] and [[radio]] stations. Jamming such signals can allow participants in the war to use the stations for a misinformation [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].

===Naval===
{{main|Naval warfare|Modern naval tactics}}

[[Naval warfare]] takes place on the high seas (blue water navy). Usually, only large, powerful nations have competent blue water or deep water navies. Modern navies primarily use [[aircraft carriers]], [[submarines]], [[frigates]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]] for combat. This provides a versatile array of attacks, capable of hitting ground targets, air targets, or other seafaring vessels. Most modern navies also have a large air support contingent, deployed from [[aircraft carriers]].  In [[World War II]], small craft ([[motor torpedo boats]] variously called PT boats, MTBs, MGBs, ''Schnellbooten'', or MAS-boats) fought near shore.  This developed in the [[Vietnam War]] into riverine warfare ([[brown water navy]]), in intertidal and river areas.  [[Irregular warfare]] makes this sort of combat more likely in the future.

===Network-centric===
{{main|Network-centric warfare}}
[[Network-centric warfare]] is essentially a new [[military doctrine]] made possible by the [[Information Age]]. [[Weapons platform]]s, [[sensor]]s and [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] centers are being connected through high-speed communication networks. The doctrine is related to the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] debate.
The overall network which enables this strategy in the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] is called the [[Global Information Grid]].

===Nuclear===
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}

[[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear war]] is a type of warfare which relies on nuclear weapons. There are two types of warfare in this category. In a limited nuclear war, a small number of weapons are used in a tactical exchange aimed primarily at opposing military forces. In a full-scale nuclear war, large numbers of weapons are used in an attack aimed at entire countries. This type of warfare would target both military bases and civilians.

===Space===
{{main|Space warfare}}

[[Space warfare]] is warfare that occurs outside the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. No wars have been fought here yet. The weapons would include [[Orbital weaponry]] and [[Space weapon]]s.  High value [[outer space]] targets would include [[satellite]]s and [[weapon platform]]s. Notably no real weapons exist in space yet, though ground-to-space missiles have been successfully tested against target satellites.
