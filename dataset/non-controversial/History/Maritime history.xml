{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
'''Maritime history''' is the study of human activity at sea. It covers a broad thematic element of [[history]] that often uses a global approach, although national and regional histories remain predominant. As an academic subject, it often crosses the boundaries of standard [[Academic discipline|discipline]]s, focusing on understanding humankind's various relationships to the [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and major [[waterway]]s of the globe. [[Nautical]] history records and interprets past events involving ships, shipping, navigation, and seafarers.

Maritime history is the broad overarching subject that includes [[fishing]], [[whaling]], international [[maritime law]], [[naval history]], the history of [[ship]]s, ship design, [[shipbuilding]], the history of [[navigation]], the history of the various maritime-related sciences ([[oceanography]], [[cartography]], [[hydrography]], etc.), sea exploration, maritime economics and trade, [[shipping]], [[yachting]], [[seaside resort]]s, the history of [[lighthouse]]s and aids to navigation, maritime themes in literature, maritime themes in art, the social history of [[sailor]]s and passengers and sea-related communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[John B. Hattendorf]], editor in chief, ''[[Oxford Encyclopedia of Maritime History]]'', (Oxford, 2007), volume 1, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, studies of merchant shipping and of defensive navies are seen as separate fields. Similarly studies of inland waterways are usually seen as not appropriately included within 'maritime history.' 

A dominant approach to maritime history writing has been nicknamed 'rivet counting' because of a focus on the minutiae of the vessel. But revisionist scholars are creating new turns in the study of maritime history. This includes a post-1980s turn towards the study of human users of ships (which involves sociology, cultural geography, gender studies and narrative studies);&lt;ref&gt;This began with the Maritime History Group,''[[Working men who got wet: Proceedings of the fourth conference of the Atlantic Canada Shipping Project, July 24-July 26, 1980]]'', (Memorial University of Newfoundland, St John, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and post-2000 turn towards seeing sea travel as part of the wider history of transport and mobilities. This move is sometimes associated with [[Marcus Rediker]] and [[Black Atlantic]] studies, but most recently has emerged from the International Association for the History of Transport, Traffic and Mobilities (T2M)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;&lt; see Yearbooks for 2009-2012, especially in the 2009 volume, article by Gijs Mom, Colin Divall and Peter Lyth, Towards a Paradigm Shift? A Decade of Transport and Mobility History, http://t2m.org/publications/yearbook/(ref).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient times==
{{main|Ancient maritime history}}
Throughout history sailing has been instrumental in the development of civilization, affording humanity greater mobility than travel over land, whether for trade, transport or warfare, and the capacity for fishing. The earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on a painted disc found in Kuwait dating to the late 5th millennium BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing#History&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient maritime history]], the first boats are presumed to have been [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoes]], developed independently by various stone age populations, and used for coastal fishing and travel. The [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Indigenous]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] are very skilled at crafting wood. Best known for [[totem poles]] up to {{convert|80|ft|m|0}} tall, they also construct dugout canoes over {{convert|60|ft|m}} long for everyday use and ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mle.matsuk12.us/american-natives/nw/nw.html Pacific Northwest Coastal Indians website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dugout canoe manner boats de bry.jpg|thumb|left|Indigenous Americans making a dugout canoe, a practice which they had done for centuries]]

The earliest seaworthy boats may have been developed as early as 45,000 years ago, according to one hypothesis explaining the habitation of [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]]. 

The earliest known reference to an organization devoted to ships in ancient India is to the [[Mauryan Empire]] from the 4th century BC. It is believed that the navigation as a science originated on the river [[Indus]] some [[Indus Valley Civilisation|5000 years ago]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians had knowledge of [[sail]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hatshepsut]] oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and ''with several sails''. Various others exist, also.&lt;/ref&gt; This is governed by the [[science]] of [[aerodynamics]]. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Some current historians believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.

[[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] refers to hypothesised interactions between the Natives populations of the Americas and peoples of other continents [[pre-Columbian|before]] the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492. Many such events have been proposed at various times, based on historical reports, archaeological finds, and cultural comparisons.

==Age of Navigation==
{{main|History of navigation}}
In early modern [[India]] and [[Arabia]] the [[lateen]]-sail ship known as the [[dhow]] was used on the waters of the [[Red Sea]], Indian Ocean, and [[Persian Gulf]]. There were also Southeast Asian [[Seafarers]] and [[Polynesian culture|Polynesians]], and the Northern European [[Vikings]], developed oceangoing vessels and depended heavily upon them for travel and population movements prior to 1000 AD. China's ships in the medieval period were particularly massive; multi-mast sailing [[junk (ship)|junks]] were carrying over 200 people as early as 200 AD. The [[Astrolabe]] was the chief tool of [[Celestial navigation]] in early maritime history. It was invented in [[ancient Greece]] and developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Islamic astronomers]]. In [[ancient China]], the engineer [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200-265 AD) invented the [[South Pointing Chariot]], a wheeled device employing a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear that allowed a fixed [[figurine]] to always point in the southern [[cardinal direction]].

The [[magnetic]] needle [[compass]] for [[navigation]] was not written of until the ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088 AD by the author [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), who was also the first to discover the concept of [[true north]] (to discern against a compass' magnetic declination towards the [[North Pole]]). By at least 1117 AD, the Chinese used a magnetic needle that was submersed in a bowl of water, and would point in the southern cardinal direction. The first use of a magnetized needle for seafaring navigation in Europe was written of by [[Alexander Neckham]], circa 1190 AD. Around 1300 AD, the pivot-needle dry-box compass was invented in Europe, its cardinal direction pointed north, similar to the modern-day mariners compass. There was also the addition of the compass-card in Europe, which was later adopted by the Chinese through contact with [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] in the 16th century.

===Ships and vessels===
{{Main|Medieval ships|Medieval European maritime culture}}

Various ships were in use during the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[longship]] was a type of ship that was developed over a period of centuries and perfected by its most famous user, the [[Vikings]], in approximately the 9th century.  The ships were [[clinker-built]], utilizing overlapping wooden strakes. The [[knaar]], a relative of the longship, was a type of cargo vessel.  It differed from the longship in that it was larger and relied solely on its [[square rigged]] sail for propulsion. The [[Cog (ship)|cog]] was a design which is believed to have evolved from (or at least been influenced by) the longship, and was in wide use by the 12th century.  It too used the clinker method of construction. The [[caravel]] was a ship invented in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]] and used in the Mediterranean from the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;John M. Hobson (2004), ''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation'', p. 141, [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-54724-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[longship]] and [[Cog (ship)|cog]], it used a [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel]] method of construction.  It could be either [[square rigged]] (''Caravela Redonda'') or [[lateen rigged]] (''Caravela Latina''). The [[carrack]] was another type of ship invented in the Mediterranean in the 15th century.  It was a larger vessel than the caravel. Columbus’s ship, the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]] was a famous example of a carrack.

===Arab age of discovery===
{{main|Islamic geography}}

The [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] maintained and expanded a wide trade network across parts of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. This helped establish the Arab Empire (including the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad]], [[Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid caliphate]]s) as the world's leading extensive economic power throughout the 7th-13th centuries.&lt;ref name=Hobson-29-30&gt;John M. Hobson (2004), ''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation'', p. 29-30, [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-54724-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers in the Islamic regions were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. [[Islamic geography]] and navigational sciences were highly developed,  making use of a magnetic [[compass]] and a rudimentary instrument known as a [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], used for [[celestial navigation]] and for measuring the [[altitude]]s and [[latitude]]s of the [[star]]s. When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across [[ocean]]s rather than skirt along the coast. According to the political scientist Hobson,  the origins of the [[caravel]] ship, used for long-distance travel by the Spanish and Portuguese since the 15th century, date back to the ''qarib'' used by [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] explorers by the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobson&quot;/&gt;

===Hanseatic League===
{{Main| Hanseatic League}}
The [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the Baltic Sea, to a certain extent the North Sea, and most of Northern Europe for a time in the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, between the 13th and 17th centuries. Historians generally trace the origins of the League to the foundation of the Northern German town of [[Lübeck]], established in 1158/1159 after the capture of the area from the Count of Schauenburg and Holstein by [[Henry the Lion]], the [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]. Exploratory trading adventures, [[Raid (military)|raid]]s and [[piracy]] had occurred earlier throughout the Baltic (see [[Viking]]s) — the [[sailor]]s of [[Gotland]] sailed up rivers as far away as [[Novgorod]], for example — but the scale of international [[economic system|economy]] in the Baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the Hanseatic League. German cities achieved domination of trade in the Baltic with striking speed over the next century, and Lübeck became a central node in all the seaborne trade that linked the areas around the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic Sea.

The 15th century saw the climax of Lübeck's hegemony. ([[Visby]], one of the midwives of the Hanseatic league in 1358, declined to become a member. Visby dominated trade in the Baltic before the Hanseatic league, and with its monopolistic ideology, suppressed the [[Gotland]]ic free-trade competition.) By the late 16th century, the League imploded and could no longer deal with its own internal struggles, the social and political changes that accompanied the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the rise of Dutch and English merchants, and the incursion of the [[Ottoman Turks]] upon its trade routes and upon the Holy Roman Empire itself. Only nine members attended the last formal meeting in 1669 and only three (Lübeck, Hamburg and Bremen) remained as members until its final demise in 1862.

===Somali maritime enterprise===
{{Main|Somali maritime history}}
[[File:Somali Enterprise.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Historical [[Somali maritime history|Somali commercial enterprise]] in the [[Red Sea]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[straits of Malacca]].]]

During the [[Ajuuraan State|Age of the Ajuuraan]], the Somali [[sultanates]] and [[republics]] of [[Merca]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Barawa]], [[Hobyo]] and their respective ports flourished. They had a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from [[Arabia]], [[India]], [[Venetian Republic|Venetia]],&lt;ref&gt;Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persia]],  [[Egypt]], [[Portugal]] and as far away as [[China]]. In the 16th century, [[Duarte Barbosa]] noted that many ships from the [[Khambhat|Kingdom of Cambaya]] in what is modern-day [[India]] sailed to Mogadishu with [[cloths]] and [[spices]], for which they in return received [[gold]], [[wax]] and [[ivory]]. Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of [[meat]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[horses]], and [[fruit]] on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants.&lt;ref&gt;East Africa and its Invaders pg.38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[early modern]] period, successor states of the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] and [[Ajuuraan State|Ajuuraan]] [[empire]]s began to flourish in Somalia who continued the  seaborne trade established by previous Somali empires. The rise of the 19th century [[Gobroon Dynasty]] in particular saw a rebirth in Somali maritime enterprise. During this period, the Somali agricultural output to [[Arabia]]n markets was so great that the coast of Somalia came to be known as the ''Grain Coast'' of [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;East Africa and the Indian Ocean By Edward A. Alpers pg 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Discovery==
{{main|Age of Discovery}}

The Age of Discovery was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which [[Europe]]an ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning [[capitalism]] in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them.

[[Christopher Columbus]] was a [[navigator]] and [[List of maritime explorers|maritime explorer]] who is one of several historical figures credited as the [[discoverer of the Americas]]. It is generally believed that he was born in [[Genoa]], although other theories and possibilities exist. Columbus' voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] began a [[Europe]]an effort at [[exploration]] and [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. While history places great significance on his first voyage of 1492, he did not actually reach the [[South America|mainland]] until his third voyage in 1498. Likewise, he was not the earliest European explorer to reach the Americas, as there are accounts of [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|European transatlantic contact]] prior to 1492. Nevertheless, Columbus's voyage came at a critical time of growing [[Imperialism|national imperialism]] and [[Competition|economic competition]] between [[History of Europe|developing nation states]] seeking wealth from the establishment of [[trade route]]s and [[Colonialism|colonies]]. Therefore, the period before 1492 is known as [[Pre-Columbian]].

[[John Cabot]] was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[navigator]] and [[exploration|explorer]] commonly credited as one of the first [[early modern Europe]]ans to land on the [[North America]]n mainland aboard the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]]'' in 1497. [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] and may have sailed with his father John Cabot in May 1497.  John Cabot and perhaps Sebastian, sailing from [[Bristol]], took their small fleet along the coasts of a [[Newfoundland (island)|&quot;New Found Land&quot;]].  There is much controversy over where exactly Cabot landed, but two likely locations that are often suggested are [[Nova Scotia]] and Newfoundland.  Cabot and his crew (including perhaps Sebastian) mistook this place for China, without finding the passage to the east they were looking for.  Some scholars maintain that the name America comes from [[Richard Amerik]], a Bristol merchant and customs officer, who is claimed on very slender evidence to have helped finance the Cabot voyages.

[[Jacques Cartier]] was a [[French people|French]] [[navigator]] who first explored and described the Gulf of St-Lawrence and the shores of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], which he named [[Canada]]. [[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernández]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer and navigator. Probably between 1563 and 1574 he discovered the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] west of [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]]. He also discovered the [[Pacific]] islands of [[San Félix]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2011}} and [[San Ambrosio]] (1574). Among the other famous [[exploration|explorer]]s of the period were [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]], [[Juan Ponce de León]], [[Francisco Coronado]], [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], [[Bartolomeu Dias]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], [[Willem Barentsz]], [[Abel Tasman]], [[Jean Alfonse]], [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[Willem Jansz]], Captain [[James Cook]], [[Henry Hudson]], and [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]].

[[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[historian]] of [[Spain]] and of the discoveries of her representatives during the [[Age of Exploration]]. He wrote the first accounts of explorations in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in a series of letters and reports, grouped in the original [[Latin]] publications of 1511-1530 into sets of ten chapters called &quot;decades.&quot;  His ''Decades'' are thus of great value in the history of geography and discovery.  His ''De Orbe Novo'' (published 1530; &quot;On the New World&quot;) describes the first contacts of Europeans and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]] and contains, for example, the first [[Europe]]an reference to [[India rubber]].

[[Richard Hakluyt]] was an [[England|English]] writer, and is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of [[North America]] by the [[English people|English]] through his works, notably ''Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America'' (1582) and ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1598–1600).

===European expansion===
{{main|Maritime history of Europe}}
The [[maritime history of Europe]] is a term used to describe significant past events relating to the northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] in areas concerning [[shipping]] and [[shipbuilding]], [[shipwrecks]], [[naval battle]]s, and [[military]] installations and [[lighthouses]] constructed to protect or aid [[navigation]] and the development of [[Europe]]. Although Europe is the world's second-smallest [[continent]] in terms of area, is has a very long coastline, and has arguably been influenced more by its ''maritime history'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable [[sea]]s and intersected by navigable [[river]]s running into them in a way which greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce.

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] that European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.  The [[Silk Road|eastern trade routes]] were controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[Turkish people|Turk]]s took control of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, and they barred Europeans from those trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New York: the World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |chapter=Chapter 1 |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to their survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbours.  The carrack and caravel both incorporated the Mediterranean [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more manoeuvrable. It was also through the Arabs that [[History of geography#Ancient Greek geography|Ancient Greek geography]] was rediscovered, for the first time giving European sailors some idea of the shape of Africa and Asia.

===European colonization===
{{main|History of colonialism|Chronology of colonialism}}

In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the [[Americas]], after which European exploration and colonization rapidly expanding. The post-1492 era is known as the [[Columbian Exchange]] period. The first conquests were made by the [[Spain|Spanish]], who quickly conquered most of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] and large parts of [[North America]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] took [[Brazil]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conquered islands in the [[Caribbean Sea]], many of which had already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease. Early European colonies in North America included [[Spanish Florida]], the British settlements in [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[New England]], French settlements in [[New France|Quebec]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], and Dutch settlements in [[New Netherlands]]. [[Denmark-Norway]] revived its former colonies in Greenland from the 18th until the 20th century, and also colonised a few of the Virgin Islands.
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|600px|World Colonization 1492-2007]]
From its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture.  Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight reign on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special [[Spanish treasure fleet|convoys]]), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade [[monopolies]] to [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] such as the [[British East India Company|East India Companies]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].

In the [[exploration of Africa]], there was the proliferation of conflicting [[Europe]]an claims to [[Africa]]n territory. By the 15th century, [[Europe]]ans explored the [[Africa]]n coast in search of a water route to [[India]]. These expeditions were mostly conducted by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who had been given papal authority to exploit all non-[[Christian]] lands of the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. The Europeans set up coastal colonies to prosecute &lt;!-- QUESTION: is this really the right word?  History suggests that the right word might be &quot;perpetuate&quot; --&gt; the [[slave trade]], but the interior of the continent remained unexplored until the 19th century. This was a cumulative period that resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and altered the future of the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Collins, ''Historical Problems of Imperial Africa,'' (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imperialism in Asia]] traces its roots back to the late 15th century with a series of voyages that sought a sea passage to India in the hope of establishing direct trade between Europe and Asia in spices. Before 1500 European economies were largely self-sufficient, only supplemented by minor trade with Asia and Africa. Within the next century, however, European and Asian economies were slowly becoming integrated through the rise of new global trade routes; and the early thrust of European political power, commerce, and culture in Asia gave rise to a growing trade in lucrative commodities—a key development in the rise of today's modern world capitalist economy. [[European colonies in India]] were set up by several European nations beginning at the beginning of the 16th century. Rivalry between reigning European powers saw the entry of the Dutch, British and French among others.

===Clipper route===
{{main|Clipper route}}
[[File:ClipperRoute.png|thumb|250px|The ''[[Clipper route]]'' followed by ships sailing between England and Australia/New Zealand]]
During this time, the [[clipper route]] was established by [[clipper|clipper ships]] between [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].  The route ran from west to east through the [[Southern Ocean]], in order to make use of the strong westerly winds of the [[Roaring Forties]].  Many ships and sailors were lost in the heavy conditions along the route, particularly at [[Cape Horn]], which the clippers had to round on their return to Europe. In September 1578, Sir [[Francis Drake]], in the course of his circumnavigation of the world, discovered Cape Horn. This discovery went unused for some time, as ships continued to use the known passage through the Strait of Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenhind.co.uk/education/worksheets/voyage.html ''Voyage of the Golden Hind''], from The Golden Hind.  Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 17th century, the Dutch merchant [[Jacob le Maire]], together with navigator [[Willem Schouten]], set off to investigate Drake's suggestion of a route to the south of Tierra del Fuego.  At the time it was discovered, the Horn was believed to be the southernmost point of Tierra del Fuego; the unpredictable violence of weather and sea conditions in the Drake Passage made exploration difficult, and it was only in 1624 that the Horn was discovered to be an island.  It is an interesting testament to the difficulty of conditions there that Antarctica, only 650 kilometres (400&amp;nbsp;mi) away across the Drake Passage, was discovered as recently as 1820, despite the passage having been used as a major shipping route for 200 years. The clipper route fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of [[steamboat|steam ships]], and the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s.

===End of exploration===
The age of exploration is generally said to have ended in the early 17th century.  By this time European vessels were well enough built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet.  Exploration, of course, continued. The Arctic and Antarctic seas were not explored until the 19th century.

==Age of Sail==
{{Main|Age of Sail}}
The '''Age of Sail''' originates from ancient seafaring exploration, during the rise of ancient civilizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_history#Age_of_Navigation&lt;/ref&gt;  Including [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Far East]] and the [[Cradle of Civilization]], the [[Arabian Sea]] has been an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] since the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the [[3rd millennium BCE]], certainly the late [[2nd millennium BCE]] up to and including the later days of [[Age of Sail]]. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north. These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravans, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates. Southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea#Trade_routes&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the modern western countries, the European &quot;Age of Sail&quot; is the period in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were both dominated by [[sailing ship]]s. The age of [[sail]] mostly coincided with the [[age of discovery]], from the 15th to the 18th century. After the 17th century, English naval maps stopped using the term of [[British Sea]] for the [[English Channel]].  From 15th to the 18th centuries, the period saw [[square rig]]ged sailing ships&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-xwEAAAAMAAJ The History of a ship from her cradle to her grave, with a short account of modern steamships &amp; torpedoes]. (1882). London: G. Routledge &amp; son.&lt;/ref&gt; carry [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlers to many parts of the world in one of the most important [[human migration]]s in recorded history. This period was marked by extensive exploration and colonization efforts on the part of European kingdoms.  The [[sextant]], developed in the 18th century, made more accurate charting of nautical position possible.

===Notable individuals===
[[Juan of Austria]] was a military leader whose most famous victory was in the naval [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571. Philip had appointed Juan to command the [[navy|naval forces]] of the [[Holy League (Mediterranean)|Holy League]] which was pitted against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Juan, by dint of leadership ability and charisma, was able to unite this disparate coalition and inflict a historic defeat upon the Ottomans and their [[Privateer|corsair]] allies in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]]. His role in the battle is commemorated in the poem &quot;[[s:Lepanto|Lepanto]]&quot; by [[G. K. Chesterton]].

[[Maarten Tromp]] was an officer and later [[admiral]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[navy]]. In 1639, during the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch struggle for independence from Spain]], Tromp defeated a large [[Spain|Spanish]] fleet bound for [[Flanders]] at the [[Battle of the Downs]], marking the end of Spanish naval power. In a preliminary battle, the [[Action of 18 September 1639]], Tromp was the first fleet commander known to deliberately use [[line of battle]] tactics. His flagship in this period was the ''Aemilia''. In the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] of 1652&amp;ndash;1653 Tromp commanded the Dutch fleet in the battles of [[Battle of Dungeness|Dungeness]], [[Battle of Portland|Portland]], [[Battle of the Gabbard|the Gabbard]] and [[Battle of Scheveningen|Scheveningen]].  In the last of these, he was killed by a sharpshooter in the rigging of [[William Penn (admiral)|William Penn]]'s ship. His acting flag captain, [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]], on the ''[[Dutch ship Brederode|Brederode]]'' kept up fleet morale by not lowering Tromp's standard, pretending Tromp was still alive.

[[Cornelis Tromp]] was a Commander in chief of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] and Danish navy. In 1656 he participated in the relief of [[Gdańsk]] ([[Danzig]]). In 1658 it was discovered he had used his ships to trade in luxury goods; as a result he was fined and not allowed to have an active command until 1662. Just before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] he was promoted to [[Vice-Admiral]] on 29 January 1665; at the [[Battle of Lowestoft]] he prevented total catastrophe by taking over fleet command to allow the escape of the larger part of the fleet. In 1676 he became Admiral-General of the Danish navy and Knight in the [[Order of the Elephant]]. He defeated the Swedish navy in the [[Battle of Öland]], his only victory as a fleet commander.

[[Charles Hardy]] was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[naval]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[governor]]. He was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the [[British Empire|British colony]] of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1744. In 1758, he and [[James Wolfe]] attacked French posts around the mouth of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and destroyed all of the French fishing stations along the northern shores of what is now [[New Brunswick]] and along the [[Gaspé peninsula]].

[[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel]] was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[admiral]] who held sea commands during the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[War of American Independence]].  During the final years of the latter conflict he served as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. During the Seven Years' War he saw constant service. He was in North America in 1755, on the coast of France in 1756, was detached on a cruise to reduce the French settlements on the west coast of Africa in 1758, and his ship the ''Torbay'' (74) was the first to get into action in the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759. In 1757 he had formed part of the court martial which had condemned Admiral [[John Byng|Byng]], but was active among those who endeavoured to secure a pardon for him; but neither he nor those who had acted with him could produce any serious reason why the sentence should not be carried out. When [[Spain]] joined [[France]] in 1762 he was sent as second in command with Sir [[George Pocock]] in the expedition which took [[Havana]]. His health suffered from the fever which carried off an immense proportion of the soldiers and sailors, but the £25,000 of prize money which he received freed him from the unpleasant position of younger son of a family ruined by the extravagance of his father.

[[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke]] was a naval officer of the [[Royal Navy]]. During the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] he was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]]. In the [[Seven Years' War]], Hawke replaced Admiral [[John Byng]] as commander in the [[Mediterranean]] in 1756.

[[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe]] was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[admiral]]. During the rebellion in North America, Howe was known to be sympathetic to the colonists - he had in prior years sought the acquaintance of [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was a friend of Howe's sister, a popular lady in London society. During his career, Howe displayed a tactical uncommon originality.  His performance was unexcelled even by [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]], who, like Howe's other successors, was served by more highly trained squadrons and benefitted from Howe's example.

[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[admiral]] famous for his participation in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], most notably in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a decisive British victory in the war, where he lost his life.&lt;ref name='nelsocchron'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelson-society.org.uk/html/chronology.html |title=Chronology |author=The Nelson Society |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson was noted for his considerable ability to inspire and bring out the best in his men, to the point that it gained a name: &quot;The Nelson Touch&quot;. His actions during these wars meant that before and after his death he was revered like few military figures have been throughout British history. [[Alexander Davison]] was a contemporary and close friend of Horatio Nelson. Davison is responsible for several acts that glorified Nelson's public image.  These included the creation of a medal commemorating the victory at the [[Battle of the Nile]] and the creation of the [[Nelson Memorial, Swarland|Nelson Memorial]] at his estate at [[Swarland]], Northumberland.  As a close friend of the Admiral he acted as an intermediary when Nelson's marriage to his wife, [[Frances Nisbet|Frances Nelson]] fell apart due in large part to his affair with [[Emma Hamilton]].

[[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Hyde Parker]] in 1778 was engaged in the [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] expedition, and in the following year his ship was wrecked on the hostile [[Cuba]]n coast. His men, however, entrenched themselves, and were in the end brought off safely. Parker was with his father at the Dogger Bank, and with [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] in the two actions in the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]. In 1793, having just become [[Rear Admiral]], he served under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] at [[Toulon]] and in [[Corsica]], and two years later, now a [[Vice Admiral]], he took part, under [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|The Lord Hotham]], in the indecisive fleet actions on 1795-03-13 and the 1795-07-13. From 1796 to 1800 he was in command at [[Jamaica]] and ably conducted the operations in the [[West Indies]].

[[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] naval officer who fought during the [[American War of Independence]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]], and the [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleonic]] Wars. Pellew is remembered as an officer and a gentleman of great courage and leadership, earning his land and titles through courage, leadership and skill - serving as a paradigm of the versatility and determination of Naval Officers during the Napoleonic Wars.

[[Antoine de Sartine]], a French statesman, was the [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Secretary of State for the Navy]] under King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Sartine inherited a strong [[French Navy]], resurrected by [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] after the disasters of the [[Seven Years' War]] when France lost [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], and [[French India|India]], and which would later defeat the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] in the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|War of American Independence]].

[[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez]] was an [[admiral]] of the British [[Royal Navy]], notable for his victory at the [[Algeciras Campaign|Battle of Algeciras]]. In 1801 he was raised to the rank of [[Rear Admiral of the Blue]], was created a baronet, and received the command of a small squadron which was destined to watch the movements of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz. Between 6 and 12 July he performed a brilliant piece of service, in which after a first repulse at Algeciras he routed a much superior combined force of French and Spanish ships at the [[Algeciras Campaign|Battle of Algeciras]]. For his services Saumarez received the [[order of the Bath]] and the [[freedom of the City of London]].

[[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] during the [[Barbary Wars]] (1801–07) was 1st lieutenant of [[USS Enterprise (1799)|''Enterprise'']], [[USS New York (1800)|''New York'']] and [[USS Philadelphia (1799)|''Philadelphia'']] and was taken prisoner when ''Philadelphia'' ran aground in [[Tripoli]] harbor 31 October 1803. After his release 3 June 1805 he remained in the [[Mediterranean]] as acting captain of [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] and later captain of ''Enterprise''. He was in charge of the naval forces at [[New Orleans]] 1808–10. As commander of [[USS Essex (1799)|USS ''Essex'']] in the [[War of 1812]], Captain Porter achieved fame by capturing the first British warship of the conflict, [[HMS Alert (1804)|''Alert'']], 13 August 1812 as well as several merchantmen. In 1813 he sailed ''Essex'' around [[Cape Horn]] and cruised in the [[Pacific]] warring on British whalers. On 28 March 1814 Porter was forced to surrender off [[Valparaiso]] after an unequal contest with the frigates [[HMS Phoebe (1795)|HMS ''Phoebe'']] and [[HMS Cherub (1806)|''Cherub'']] and only when his ship was too disabled to offer any resistance.

===Spanish and English Armadas===
{{main|Spanish Armada|English Armada}}
The [[Spanish Armada]] was the [[Spain|Spanish]] fleet that sailed against [[England]] under the command of the [[Alonso de Guzmán El Bueno, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidona]] in 1588. The Spanish Armada was sent by King [[Philip II of Spain]], who had been king consort of England until the death of his wife [[Mary I of England]] thirty years earlier. The purpose of the expedition was to escort the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma's]] army of [[tercio]]s from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] across the [[North Sea]] for a landing in south-east England. Once the army had suppressed English support for the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] &amp;mdash; part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] &amp;mdash; it was intended to cut off attacks against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish possessions]] in the [[New World]] and the Atlantic [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure fleet]]s. It was also hoped to reverse the Protestant revolution in England, and to this end the expedition was supported by [[Pope Sixtus V]], with the promise of a subsidy should it make land.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/The_Spanish_Armada|title=The Spanish Armada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The command of the fleet was originally entrusted to Alvaro de Bazan, a highly experienced naval commander who died a few months before the fleet sailed from Lisbon in May 1588.

The Spanish Armada consisted of about 130 warships and converted merchant ships. After forcing its way up the [[English Channel]], it was attacked by a fleet of 200 [[Royal Navy|English ships]], assisted by the Dutch navy, in the North Sea at [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Gravelines]] off the coastal border between [[France]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. A [[fire ship|fire-ship]] attack drove the Armada ships from their safe anchorage, and in the ensuing battle the Spanish abandoned their rendezvous with Parma's army.

The Spanish Armada was blown north up the east coast of England and in a hasty strategic move, attempted a return to Spain by sailing around Scotland and out into the Atlantic, past Ireland. But very severe weather destroyed a portion of the fleet, and more than 24 vessels were wrecked on the north and western coasts of Ireland, with the survivors having to seek refuge in Scotland. Of the Spanish Armada's initial complement of vessels, about 50 did not return to Spain. However, the loss to Philip's Royal Navy was comparatively small: only seven ships failed to return, and of these only three were lost to enemy action.

The [[English Armada]] was a fleet of warships sent to the Iberian coast by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1589, during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1585&amp;ndash;1604). It was led by Sir [[Francis Drake]] as admiral and Sir [[John Norreys]] as general, and failed in its attempt to drive home the advantage England had won upon the defeat and dispersal of the [[Spanish Armada]] in the previous year. With the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against the weakened Spanish lost, the failure of the expedition further depleted the crown treasury that had been so carefully restored during the long reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish war]] was very costly to both sides, and Spain itself, also fighting [[France]] and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], had to default on its debt repayments in 1596, following another raid on Cadiz. But the failure of the English Armada was a turning point, and the fortunes of the various parties to this complicated conflict fluctuated until the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]] in 1604, when a peace was agreed.

Spain's rebuilt navy had quickly recovered and exceeded its pre-Armada dominance of the sea, until defeats by the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch]] fifty years later marked the beginning of its decline. With the peace, the English were able to consolidate their hold on Ireland and make a concerted effort to establish colonies in North America.

===North American maritime===
The ''[[maritime history of the United States]]'' starts in the modern sense with the first successful English colony  established in 1607, on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. It languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and set up commercial agriculture based on tobacco. The connection between the American colonies and Europe, with shipping as its cornerstone, would continue to grow unhindered for almost two hundred years.

The ''[[Continental Navy]]'' was formed during the [[American Revolution]] in 1774-1775.  Through the efforts of the Continental Navy's apparent patron, [[John Adams]] and vigorous congressional support in the face of stiff opposition, the fleet cumulatively became relatively substantial when considering the limitations imposed upon the Patriot supply poole. The &quot;''[[Six original United States frigates]]'''&quot; were the first [[United States]] [[frigate]]s of the [[United States Navy]], first authorized by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] with the [[Naval Act of 1794]] on March 27, 1794 at a cost of $688,888.82.

[[John Paul Jones]] was [[USA|America's]] first well-known [[US Navy|naval]] hero in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. John Paul adopted the alias ''John Jones'' when he fled to his brother's home in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] in 1773 in order to avoid the hangman's noose in [[Tobago]] after an incident when he was accused of murdering a sailor under his command. He began using the name ''John Paul Jones'' as his brother suggested during the start of the [[American Revolution]]. Though his naval career never rose above the rank of Captain in the [[Continental Navy]] after his victory over the ''[[HMS Serapis (1779)|Serapis]]'' with the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]'', John Paul Jones remains the first genuine American Naval hero, and a highly regarded battle commander.

[[Jonathan Haraden]] was a [[privateer]] during the [[American Revolution]], being the [[First Lieutenant]] of the [[sloop-of-war]] [[Tyrannicide (ship)|''Tyrannicide'']], fourteen guns. On board for two years, he captured many prizes, becoming her commander in 1777.

[[George H. Preble]] was an [[United States|American]] [[naval officer]] and [[writer]], notable for his history of the [[flag of the United States]] and for taking the first photograph of the [[Fort McHenry]] flag that inspired ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''. George entered the [[United States Navy|Navy]] as a [[midshipman]] on 10 December 1835, serving on the [[USS United States (1797)|''United States'']] until 1838.

[[Edward Preble]] was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] naval officer. Following his Revolutionary War service, he was appointed [[1st Lieutenant]] in the U.S. Navy. In January 1799, he assumed command of the 14 gun brig [[USS Pickering (1798)|''Pickering'']] and took her to the [[West Indies]] to protect American commerce during the [[Quasi-War]] with [[France]]. Commissioned [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] 7 June 1799, he took command of [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']] in December and sailed in January 1800 for the Pacific to provide similar protective services for Americans engaged in the [[East Indies]] trade. Given command of the 3rd Squadron, with [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] as his [[flagship]], in 1803, he sailed for the [[Barbary coast]] and by October had promoted a treaty with [[Morocco]] and established a blockade off [[Tripoli]] in the [[First Barbary War]].

===War of 1812===
{{Main|War of 1812}}
[[Stephen Decatur]] was an [[United States Navy|American naval]] officer notable for his heroism in the [[Barbary Wars]] and in the [[War of 1812]]. He was the youngest man to reach the rank of captain in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]], and the first American celebrated as a national military hero who had not played a role in the [[American Revolution]].

[[James Lawrence]] was an [[United States|American]] [[United States Navy|naval]] hero. During the War of 1812, he commanded the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] in a [[single-ship action]] against the [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] (commanded by [[Philip Broke]]). He is probably best known today for his [[q:Last words|dying command]] &quot;Don't give up the ship!&quot;, which is still a popular naval [[battle cry]].

[[John H. Aulick]] was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] whose service extended from the [[War of 1812]] to the end of the [[antebellum era]]. During the War of 1812, he served in [[USS Enterprise (1799)|''Enterprise'']] and took part in her battle with [[HMS Boxer (1812)|HMS ''Boxer'']] on 4 September 1813. After that engagement ended in an American victory, Aulick served as [[prize master]] of the prize.

[[Thomas Macdonough]] was an early 19th century American naval officer, most notably as commander of American naval forces on [[Lake Champlain]] during the War of 1812. One of the leading members of &quot;Preble's Boys&quot;, a small group of naval officers who served during the [[First Barbary War]], Macdonough's actions during the decisive [[Battle of Lake Champlain]] are often cited as a model of tactical preparation and execution.

=== Challenger expedition ===
The [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], built in 1858, undertook the first global marine research expedition called the [[Challenger expedition]] in 1872. To enable her to probe the depths, all but two of the ''Challenger''{{'}}s guns had been removed and her spars reduced to make more space available. Laboratories, extra cabins and a special dredging platform were installed. She was loaded with specimen jars, alcohol for preservation of samples, microscopes and chemical apparatus, trawls and dredges, thermometers and water sampling bottles, sounding leads and devices to collect sediment from the sea bed and great lengths of rope with which to suspend the equipment into the ocean depths. In all she was supplied with 181 miles (291&amp;nbsp;km) of Italian hemp for sounding, trawling and dredging. As the first true oceanographic cruise, the Challenger expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline.

===End of the sail===
Like most [[history by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact and close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], finally culminating with the advance of [[steam power]], rendering sail power obsolete.

==Submarines==
The ''[[history of submarines]]'' covers the [[historical]] [[chronology]] and facts related to ''[[submarines]]'', the ships and boats which operate underwater. The modern underwater boat proposal was made by the Englishman [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] who designed a prototype submarine in 1578. Unfortunately for him these ideas never got beyond the planning stage. The first submersible proper to be actually built in modern times was built in 1620 by [[Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel]], a Dutchman in the service of [[James I of England|James I]]: it was based on Bourne's design. It was propelled by means of oars. The precise nature of the submarine type is a matter of some controversy; some claim that it was merely a bell towed by a boat. Two improved types were tested in the [[Thames]] between 1620 and 1624.

==Age of Steam==
Steam was first applied to boats in the 1770s. With the advent of economical [[steam engine]]s, efficient [[External combustion engine|external combustion]] [[heat engine]]s that makes use of the heat [[energy]] that exists in [[steam]] and converting it to [[mechanical work]], the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] was steam for ships. The technology only became relevant to trans-oceanic travel after 1815, the year Pierre Andriel crossed the [[English Channel]] aboard the steam ship Élise.

===Rise of the steam vessels===
A [[steamboat]], sometimes called a steamer, became the primary method of propulsion is the age of steam power, typically driving a propeller or [[paddlewheel]]. Small and large steamboats and riverboats worked on lakes and rivers. Steamships gradually replaced sailing ships for commercial shipping through the 19th century. From 1815 on, steamships increased significantly in speed and size.

[[Ironclad]]s are [[steam engine|steam-propelled]] [[warship]]s of the later 19th century, protected by [[iron]] or [[steel]] armor plates.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Richard. ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'' ISBN 0-304-35273-X; p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. The first ironclad battleship, ''[[French battleship La Gloire|La Gloire]]'', was launched by the [[French Navy]] in 1859;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, Lawrence. ''Naval Warfare 1815&amp;ndash;1914'' ISBN 0-415-21478-5. pp73–4&lt;/ref&gt; she prompted the British [[Royal Navy]] to start building ironclads. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first clashes of ironclads]] took place during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the [[Ship of the line|unarmored line-of-battle ship]] as the most powerful warship afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
{{main|Greek revolution}}
[[File:Lytras-nikiforos-pyrpolisi-tourkikis-navarhidas-apo-kanari.jpeg|thumb|upright|The destruction of the Turkish flagship at Chios by Kanaris]]
Greek War of Independence was a successful war waged by the Greeks to win independence for Greece from the Ottoman Empire. Success at sea was vital for the Greeks. If they failed to counter the Ottoman Navy, it would be able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s Asian provinces at will, crushing the rebellion. The Greeks decided to use [[fireships]] and found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. Conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]], [[Nikolis Apostolis]], [[Iakovos Tombazis]] and [[Antonios Kriezis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at [[Naval Battle of Patras|Patras]] and [[Naval Battle of Spetsai|Spetsai]] gave the crews confidence, and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese. Despite victories at [[Naval Battle of Samos|Samos]] and [[Naval Battle of Gerontas|Gerontas]], the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827. The Ottoman fleet was decisively defeated by the combined fleets of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[July Monarchy|France]] and the [[Russian Empire]], effectively securing the independence of Greece.

===1850 to the End of the Century===
Most warships used steam propulsion until the advent of the gas turbine. Steamships were superseded by diesel-driven ships in the second half of the 20th century.

The ''[[Confederate States Navy]]'' (''CSN'') was the [[Navy|naval branch]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] [[armed forces]] established by an act of the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] on February 21, 1861. It was responsible for Confederate naval operations during the [[American Civil War]].  The two major tasks of the Confederate Navy during the whole of its existence were the protection of [[Southern United States|Southern]] harbors and coastlines from outside invasion, and making the war costly for the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] by attacking merchant ships and breaking the [[Union blockade|Union Blockade]].

[[David Farragut]] was the first  senior officer of the [[U.S. Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He was the first [[rear admiral]], [[vice admiral]], and full [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] of the Navy. He is remembered in popular culture for his possibly apocryphal order at the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]], usually paraphrased: &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 682. The [http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/qyd/media.asp ''Reuters'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franklin Buchanan]] was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] who became an [[admiral]] in the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]], and commanded the ironclad [[CSS Virginia]]. He was the captain of the [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] (formerly the [[USS Merrimack (1855)|USS ''Merrimack'']]) during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in Virginia. He climbed to the top deck of the ''Virginia'' and began furiously firing toward shore with a [[carbine]] as the [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']] was shelled. He soon was brought down by a [[sharpshooter]]'s [[minie ball]] to the thigh. He would eventually recover from his leg wound. He never did get to command the ''Virginia'' against the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]. That honor went to [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]]. But Buchanan had handed the [[US Navy]] the worst defeat it would take until [[Pearl Harbor]].

[[Raphael Semmes]] was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] from 1826 to 1860 and the [[Confederate States Navy]] from 1860 to 1865.  During the [[American Civil War]] he was captain of the famous commerce raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], taking a record fifty-five [[prize]]s. Late in the war he was promoted to [[admiral]] and also served briefly as a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]].

In Italy, [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]] was an [[Italy|Italian]] admiral and commander of the [[Regia Marina]] fleet at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]]. He commanded the fleet from 1860 to 1861, and saw action in the struggle for [[Risorgimento|Italian unification]].
After unification he was elected to the legislature; he became Minister of Marine in 1862 and in 1865 he was nominated a Senator. However, his career was marred during the [[Seven Weeks War|war with Austria]] when he commanded the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]]. After the defeat, he was condemned for incapacity, and discharged.

Again in America, [[Charles Edgar Clark]] was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Spanish-American War]]. He commanded the [[battleship]] [[USS Oregon (BB-3)|''Oregon'']] at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], [[San Francisco]], and when war with [[Spain]] was deemed inevitable, he received orders to proceed to [[Key West, Florida]], with all haste. After a most remarkable voyage of over {{convert|14000|mi|km}}, around [[Cape Horn]], he joined the American fleet in [[Cuba]]n waters on May 26, and on July 3 commanded his ship at the destruction of [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Cervera]]'s squadron.

[[George Dewey]] was an [[admiral]] of the  [[United States Navy]], best known for his victory (without the loss of a single life of his own forces due to combat; one man died of a heart attack) at the [[Battle of Manila Bay (1898)|Battle of Manila Bay]] during the [[Spanish-American War]]. He was also the only person in the history of the United States to have attained the rank of [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]], the most senior rank in the United States Navy.

[[Garrett J. Pendergrast]] was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He commanded [[USS Boston|''Boston'']] during the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846.  In 1856, he commissioned [[USS Merrimack (1855)|''Merrimack'']], the ship that would later become the ''Virginia''.

[[Lewis Nixon (naval architect)|Lewis Nixon]] was a shipbuilding executive, [[naval architecture|naval architect]], and political activist. Nixon graduated first in his class from the Naval Academy in 1882 and was sent to study naval architecture at the Royal Naval College where, again, he graduated first in the class in 1885. In 1890 with help from assistant naval constructor [[David W. Taylor]] he designed the Indiana class battleships which included [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|USS ''Indiana'']], [[USS Massachusetts (BB-2)|USS ''Massachusetts'']] and [[USS Oregon (BB-3)|USS ''Oregon'']].

[[Patricio Montojo]] was the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Admiral|naval commander]] at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] (May 1, 1898), a decisive battle of the [[Spanish-American War]]. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Montojo was in command of the Spanish Squadron that was destroyed by the U.S. Asiatic Squadron in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898.  Montojo was wounded during this battle, as was also one of his two sons who were participating in this battle.  [[United States Navy|United States naval forces]] under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] decisively defeated Spain's Pacific fleet, at anchor in Manila Bay, the Philippines. Most of the seven Spanish vessels sank or surrendered.

==20th century==
In the 20th century, the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[gas turbine]] came to replace the steam engine in most ship applications.  Trans-oceanic travel, [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] and [[transpacific]], was a particularly important application, with steam powered [[Ocean liner]]s replacing sailing ships, then culminating in the massive [[Superliner (passenger ship)|Superliners]] which included the [[RMS Titanic]]. The event with the Titanic lead to the [[Maritime Distress Safety System]].

At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe. Some of them were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping. The British [[Royal Navy]] systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect allied shipping. For example, the detached light cruiser Emden, part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the bulk of the German East-Asia squadron – consisting of the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, light cruisers Nürnberg and Leipzig and two transport ships – did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it was lost at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Taylor, &quot;Audacious Cruise of the Emden&quot;, The Quarterly Journal of Military History, Volume 19, Number 4, Summer 2007, pp. 39-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a Naval [[Blockade]] of Germany, preventing supplies from reaching its ports. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by international agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;LondonDeclaration&quot;&gt;[[London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lance Edwin Davis, Stanley L.

In 1916 the United States launched a protest over a cross-channel passenger ferry sinking, [[Sussex pledge|Germany modified its rules of engagement]]. Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], realizing the Americans would eventually enter the war. Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas.

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships&lt;ref&gt;Britain armed its merchant ships.&lt;/ref&gt; entered [[convoy]]s escorted by destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7IrOezel0GYC The Crisis of the Naval War] by [[Jellicoe of Scapa]]&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets. The accompanying destroyers might sink a submerged submarine with [[depth charges]]. The losses to submarine attacks were reduced significantly. But the convoy system slowed the flow of supplies. The solution to the delays was a massive program to build new freighters. Various troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not have to travel the North Atlantic in convoys.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Baer, One Hundred Years of Sea Power: The U. S. Navy, 1890-1990. Page 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World War also saw the first use of [[aircraft carriers]] in combat, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern]] in July 1918.

===Maritime events of World War II===

====Battle of the Atlantic====
[[File:Pennsylvania Sun.jpg|thumb|The tanker MS ''Pennsylvania Sun'', torpedoed by [[Unterseeboot 571|''U 571'']] on 15 July 1942]]
[[File:Submarine attack (AWM 304949).jpg|thumb|A U-Boat under attack by Allied aircraft in 1943]]
{{main|Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)}}
In the [[North Atlantic]], German [[U-boat]]s attempted to cut supply lines to the United Kingdom by sinking merchant ships. In the first four months of the war they sank more than 110 vessels. In addition to supply ships, the U-boats occasionally attacked British and Canadian warships. One U-boat sank the British [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] [[HMS Courageous (50)|HMS ''Courageous'']], while another managed to sink the [[battleship]] [[HMS Royal Oak (1914)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] in her home anchorage of [[Scapa Flow]].

In the summer of 1941, the Soviet Union entered the war on the side of the Allies. Although the Soviets had tremendous reserves in manpower, they had lost much of their equipment and manufacturing base in the first few weeks following the German invasion. The Western Allies attempted to remedy this by sending [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]], which travelled from the United Kingdom and the United States to the northern ports of the Soviet Union - [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] and [[Murmansk]]. The treacherous route around the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] of Norway was the site of many battles as the Germans continually tried to disrupt the convoys using U-boats, bombers, and surface ships.

Following the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, U-boats sank shipping along the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Canada]], the waters around [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], the [[Battle of the Caribbean|Caribbean Sea]], and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They were initially so successful that this became known among U-boat crews as the [[second happy time]]. Eventually, the institution of shore [[Blackout (wartime)|blackouts]] and an interlocking convoy system resulted in a drop in attacks and U-boats shifted their operations back to the mid-Atlantic.

The turning point of the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] took place in early 1943 as the Allies refined their [[naval tactics]], effectively making use of new technology to counter the U-Boats. The Allies produced ships faster than they were sunk, and lost fewer ships by adopting the [[convoy]] system. Improved [[anti-submarine warfare]] meant that the [[life expectancy]] of a typical U-boat crew would be measured in months. The vastly improved [[German Type XXI submarine|Type 21 U-boat]] appeared as the war was ending, but too late to affect the outcome. In December 1943, the last major sea battle between the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] took place. At the [[Battle of North Cape]], the German battleship [[German battleship Scharnhorst (1936)|''Scharnhorst'']], was sunk by [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']], [[HMS Belfast|HMS ''Belfast'']], and several destroyers.

====Pacific War====
[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]
{{main|Pacific War}}
The [[Pacific War]] was the part of [[World War II]]—and preceding conflicts—that took place in the [[Pacific Ocean]], its islands, and in [[East Asia]], between July 7, 1937, and August 14, 1945.  The most decisive actions took place after the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked various countries, later known as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (or Allied powers), on or after December 7, 1941, including an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on United States forces at Pearl Harbor]]. The attack on Pearl Harbor (called the ''Hawaii Operation'' or ''Operation Z'' by the [[Japan]]ese [[Imperial General Headquarters]], and the ''Battle of Pearl Harbor'' by some Americans)&lt;ref&gt;Fukudome, Shigeru, &quot;Hawaii Operation&quot;. United States Naval Institute, ''Proceedings'', 81 (December 1955), pp.1315-1331&lt;/ref&gt; was a surprise [[military strike]] conducted by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] against the [[United States]] [[naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]] on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack was intended as a [[preventive war|preventive]] action in order to keep the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from influencing the war that the [[Empire of Japan]] was planning in [[Southeast Asia]], against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]], as well as the U.S. in the [[Philippines]]. The base was attacked by 353 Japanese aircraft in two waves, launched from six [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;parillo288&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Parillo|2006|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the United States entry into [[World War II]] in both the Pacific and European theaters. Despite numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action, the lack of any formal warning by Japan, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led to [[List of Presidents of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proclaiming December 7, 1941, &quot;[[Infamy Speech|a date which will live in infamy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiochemistry.org/history/video/fdr_infamy.html Recording of the Infamy Speech]. radiochemistry.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufoUtoQLGQY Franklin D. Roosevelt] - Declaration of War. youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1942 and 1945, there were four main [[theater (military)|theatres]] in the Pacific War, corresponding with and defined by the major Allied [[Unified Combatant Command|command]]s in the war against Japan. U.S. sources refer to two theaters within the Pacific War: the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]] (PTO) and the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] (CBI). However these were not operational commands. In the PTO, the Allies divided operational control of their forces between two supreme commands, known as [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]].

[[File:Japanese battleships Yamashiro, Fuso and Haruna.jpg|thumb|Japanese battleships [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']], [[Japanese battleship Fuso|''Fuso'']] and [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']] (more distant).]]

[[Leapfrogging (strategy)|Island hopping]] was an important military strategy in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]]. The strategy employed by the [[Allies|Allies of World War II]] [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]], beginning with [[Operation Cartwheel]], was to bypass heavily fortified [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] positions and instead concentrate the limited Allied resources on strategically important [[island]]s that were not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of [[Japan]]. This strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to [[blockade]] and isolate Japanese bases, weakening their garrisons and reducing the Japanese ability to resupply and reinforce. Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at [[Rabaul]], were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to &quot;wither on the vine.&quot;

Hard-fought battles on the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese home islands]] of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]], and others resulted in horrific casualties on both sides, but finally produced a Japanese retreat. Faced with the loss of most of their experienced pilots, the Japanese increased their use of [[kamikaze]] tactics in an attempt to create unacceptably high casualties for the [[Allies]]. After  ''the turning point of the Pacific'' where a third of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] fleet was hit in the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[United States Department of the Navy]] recommended various positions for and against an [[invasion of Japan]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;The use of force: military power and international politics By Robert J.

===Latter half of the 20th century===
In the latter half of the 20th century, various vessels, notably [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[nuclear submarine]]s, and [[Nuclear powered icebreaker]]s, made use of [[Nuclear marine propulsion]]. [[Sonar]] and [[radio]] augmented existing navigational technology.

Various [[blockade]]s were set up in international action. The [[Egypt]]ian set up blockades of the [[Straits of Tiran]] prior to the 1956 [[Suez War]] and the [[1967 Arab-Israeli War]]. The [[United States]] set up a blockade of [[Cuba]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]] in 1962. The [[Israel]]is set up a sea blockade of the [[Gaza Strip]] since the outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]] (2000) and up to the present. The [[Israel]]i blockades of some or all the shores of [[Lebanon]] at various times during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975&amp;ndash;1990), the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and the [[1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict]] -  resumed during the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
[[File:Location of Navy and Soviet ships during the Cuban Missile Crisis.jpg|thumb|The image is a recently declassified map used by the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet shows the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis.]]
The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] was a confrontation during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States government|Government of the United States]], the [[Government of the Soviet Union]], and the [[Government of Cuba]]. After the U.S. started deploying 15 Jupiter IRBM near İzmir, Turkey, U.S. [[reconnaissance]] imagery revealed similar installations being installed in Cuba, as a response to the American threat. The event coincided with the [[Sino-Indian War]], which began on the same date that the US declared its blockade on Cuba. Historians speculate the [[China|Chinese]] attack on disputed territory in [[India]] was timed to occur at the same time as the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.frontierindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=53 Frontier India India-China Section] Note alleged connections to Cuban Missile Crisis&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, the [[Organization of American States]] unanimously supported the decision to quarantine Cuba and, by the end of the day, 180 U.S. Navy ships were prepared for the blockade. Nikita Khrushchev claimed that the blockade was illegal, and ordered ships to bypass the quarantine.

The blockade went into effect at 10 a.m. on October 24. At the time, nineteen ships were en-route to Cuba from the Soviet Union. Sixteen of these were clearly identified as reversing course, and only the tanker ''Bucharest'' continued towards the U.S. lines. The other two, the ''Gagarin'' and ''Komiles'' were later discovered only a few miles from the U.S. lines, and that they were being escorted by a Soviet submarine positioned between the two ships. The [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']] was instructed to block the progress of the submarine, including the use of &quot;small explosives&quot; if need be. At 10:25 a.m. [[John McCone]] received an intelligence message and announced that the ships had gone dead in the water. [[Dean Rusk]] leaned over to [[McGeorge Bundy]] and noted &quot;We're eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked.&quot; After secret negotiations and after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy agreed to remove all missiles set in place on the border of the Soviet Union because of NATO in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles on Cuba.

====Gulf of Tonkin Incident====
{{Main|Gulf of Tonkin Incident|Vietnam War}}
[[File:Tonkingunboats.jpg|thumb|Photograph taken from the USS ''Maddox'' August 2, 1964 showing North Vietnamese patrol boats.]]
The [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]] was an alleged pair of attacks by naval forces of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (commonly referred to as North Vietnam) against two American [[destroyer]]s, the [[USS Maddox (DD-731)|USS ''Maddox'']] and the [[USS Turner Joy (DD-951)|USS ''Turner Joy'']]. The attacks were alleged to have occurred on 2 August and 4 August 1964 in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. Later research, including a report released in 2005 by the [[National Security Agency]], indicated that the second attack most likely did not occur, but also attempted to dispel the long-standing assumption that members of the administration of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had knowingly lied about the nature of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/vietnam/ Gulf of Tonkin - 11/30/2005 and 05/30/2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the incident was the passage by [[United States Congress|Congress]] of the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]]), which granted Johnson the authority to assist any [[Southeast Asia]]n country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by &quot;[[communism|communist]] aggression&quot;. The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for escalating American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].

====Falklands War====
{{Main|Falklands War}}
The [[Falklands War]] was fought in 1982 between [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] over the disputed [[Falkland Islands]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. Britain was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, but launched a naval [[task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]], and retake the islands by [[amphibious assault]]. The British eventually prevailed and the islands remained under British control.

====Panama canal handover====
{{Main|Panama canal}}
Though controversial within the United States, a process of handing the [[Panama canal]] lead to [[Panama]]nian control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] by the [[Panama Canal Authority|Panama Canal Authority (ACP)]]. It was effective at noon on December 31, 1999. Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the Canal's container shipping ports (chiefly two facilities at the Atlantic and Pacific outlets), which was won by the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] firm [[Hutchison Whampoa]], a [[Hong Kong]]-based shipping concern whose owner [[Li Ka Shing]] is the wealthiest man in Asia. One of the conditions on the handover to the Panama Canal Authority by the United States was the permanent neutrality of the Canal and the explicit statements that allowed the United States to come back at any time.

==21st century==
[[File:HMS Helsingborg 2.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Helsingborg]], one of the [[Swedish Navy|Swedish Navy's]] [[Visby class corvette]]s]]
Since the turn of the millennium, the construction of [[stealth ship]]s have occurred. These are ships which employs [[stealth technology]] construction techniques in an effort to ensure that it is harder to detect by one or more of [[radar]], visual, [[sonar]], and infrared methods. These techniques borrow from [[stealth aircraft]] technology, although some aspects such as wake reduction are unique to stealth ships' design.

Some of the major social changes of this period include women becoming admirals in defensive navies, being allowed to work on submarines, and being appointed captains of cruise ships. On Cunard, Royal Caribbean and P&amp;O they include Liz Lauritzen, Karin Stahre-Janson, Inger Olsen and Sarah Breton &lt;ref&gt;(http://www.reuters.com/.../us-travel-ship-captain-idUSTRE73E1OL201104&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of cruise ship crime - including murder, rape, theft and passengers disappearing overboard - has brought a new focus on ships as sites of aberrant social activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cruisejunkie.com/events.html&lt;/ref&gt;
