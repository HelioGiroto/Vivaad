{{History of China}}

The '''Zhou Dynasty''' (1046–256 BC) ({{zh|c=周朝|p=Zhōu Cháo|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|tʂóʊ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ|}}) was a [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]] that followed the [[Shang Dynasty]] and preceded the [[Qin Dynasty]]. Although the Zhou Dynasty lasted longer than any other dynasty in [[History of China|Chinese history]], the actual political and military control of [[China]] by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] ({{zh|c=姬}}) family lasted only until 771 BC, a period known as the Western Zhou.

During the Zhou Dynasty, the [[Iron Age China|use of iron]] was introduced to China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/EARFE/EARFE.html|title = The earliest use of iron in China, in Metals in Antiquity|editor=Suzanne M. M. Young, A. Mark Pollard, Paul Budd and Robert A. Ixer (BAR international series,792)|publisher= Oxford: Archaeopress|year= 1999|pages= 1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this period of Chinese history produced what many consider the zenith of Chinese [[bronze]]-ware making. The dynasty also spans the period in which the written script evolved into its modern form with the use of an archaic clerical script that emerged during the late [[Warring States period]].

==History==
===Foundation===
{{see also|Duchy of Zhou}}
According to [[Chinese mythology#Shang Dynasty|Chinese mythology]], the Zhou lineage began when [[Jiang Yuan|a consort]] of the legendary [[Emperor Ku]] [[miraculous births|miraculously conceived]] [[Ji Qi|Qi]] (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; &quot;the Abandoned One&quot;) after stepping into a [[Shangdi|divine footprint]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ode2ji&quot;&gt;[[Shijing]], [[s:Shih_King,_the_Book_of_Odes/Part_III/The_Second_Decade/Ode_245|Ode 245]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;&quot;Hou Ji&quot;. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Qi was a [[culture hero]] credited with surviving three abandonments by his mother and with greatly improving Xia agriculture,&lt;ref name=&quot;ode2ji&quot;/&gt; to the point where he was granted lordship over [[Tai (city)|Tai]] and the [[Chinese ancestral name|ancestral name]] [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] by his own Xia king and a later [[posthumous name]] ([[Houji]], &quot;Lord of [[Millet]]&quot;) by the Shang king [[Tang of Shang|Tang]]. He even received sacrifice as a [[Agriculture (Chinese mythology)|harvest god]].

Qi's son [[Buzhu]] abandoned his position at court and either he or his son [[Ji Ju|Ju]] abandoned agriculture entirely, living a nomadic life in the manner of their [[Xirong|Rong]] and [[Beidi|Di]] [[Hua-Yi distinction|barbarian]] neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]]. ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=4579&amp;remap=gb Annals of Zhou, §3].&lt;/ref&gt; Ju's son [[Gongliu of Zhou|Duke Liu]],{{sfnp|Wu|1982|p=235}} however, led his people to prosperity by restoring agriculture and settling them at a place called [[Bin (city)|Bin]],{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The exact location of Bin remains obscure, but it may have been close to [[Linfen]] on the [[Fen River]] in present-day [[Shanxi]].{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|p=303}}{{sfnp|Wu|1982|p=273}}}} which his descendants ruled [[ancestry of the Zhou dynasty|for generations]]. [[Gugong Danfu|Old Duke Danfu]] later led the clan from Bin to Zhou, an area in the [[Wei River]] valley of modern-day [[Qishan County]]. 

The duke passed over his two elder sons [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]] and [[Zhongyong of Wu|Zhongyong]] to favor [[King Ji of Zhou|Jili]], a warrior who conquered several [[Xirong (people)|Rong]] tribes as a vassal of the Shang kings [[Wu Yi]] and [[Wen Ding]] before being treacherously killed. Taibo and Zhongyong had supposedly already fled to the Yangtze delta, where they established the [[state of Wu]] among the tribes there. Jili's son [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] bribed his way out of imprisonment and moved the Zhou capital to [[Fengjing (Zhou)|Feng]] (within present-day [[Xi'an]]). Around 1046 BC, King Wen's son [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] and his ally [[Jiang Ziya]] led an army of 45,000 men and 300 [[Chinese chariot|chariots]] across the [[Yellow River]] and defeated [[King Zhou of Shang]] at the [[Battle of Muye]], marking the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sima Qian was only able to establish historical dates after the time of the [[Gonghe Regency]]. Earlier dates, like that of 1046 BC for the Battle of Muye, are given in this article according to the official PRC [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]], but they remain contentious. Various historians have offered dates for the battle ranging between 1122 and 1027 BC.}}

===Western Zhou===
{{main|Western Zhou}}
[[File:EN-WesternZhouStates.jpg|thumb|left|States of the Western Zhou Dynasty]]
King Wu maintained the old capital for ceremonial purposes but constructed a new one for his palace and administration nearby at [[Haojing|Hao]]. Although Wu's early death left a young and inexperienced heir, the [[Duke of Zhou]] assisted his nephew [[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] in consolidating royal power. He quelled rebellious Zhou princes, feudal rulers, and Shang partisans;{{sfnp|Chinn|2007|p=43}}{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=32}} countered Zhou's crisis of legitimacy by expounding the doctrine of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] while accommodating important Shang rituals at [[ancient Chinese urban planning#Chengzhou|Chengzhou]];{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=33}} and set up the ''[[fengjian]]'' system to maintain Zhou authority over its greatly-expanded territory.{{sfnp|Chinn|2007|p=43}}

Over time, this decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasts thinned over the generations. Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige on par with that of the Zhou.{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} When [[King You of Zhou|King You]] demoted and exiled his [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] queen in favor of the beautiful but common [[Bao Si]], the disgraced queen's father the [[Marquis of Shen]] joined with Zeng and the [[Quanrong]] [[Hua-Yi distinction|barbarians]] to sack [[Haojing|Hao]] in 771 BC. With King You dead, a conclave of nobles met at [[state of Shen|Shen]] and declared the Marquis's grandson [[King Ping of Zhou|King Ping]]. The capital was moved eastward to [[Chengzhou]], marking the end of the &quot;Western Zhou&quot; ({{lang|zh|西周}}, &lt;small&gt;p&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Xī Zhōu'') and the beginning of the &quot;Eastern Zhou&quot; dynasty ({{lang|zh|東周}}, &lt;small&gt;p&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Dōng Zhōu'').

===Eastern Zhou===
The Eastern Zhou was characterized by an accelerating collapse of royal authority, although the king's ritual importance allowed over five more centuries of rule. The [[Spring and Autumn Annals|Confucian chronicle]] of the early years of this process led to its title of the [[Spring and Autumn Period|&quot;Spring and Autumn&quot; Period]]. The [[partition of Jin]] in the mid-5th century BC initiated a second phase, the [[Warring States Period|&quot;Warring States&quot;]].{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} In 403 BC, the Zhou court recognized [[state of Han|Han]], [[state of Zhao|Zhao]], and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] as fully independent states; in 344 BC, the first {{ndash}} [[King Hui of Wei|Duke Hui]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] {{ndash}} claimed the royal title of [[wang (title)|king]] for himself. A series of states rose to prominence before each falling in turn, but Zhou was a minor player in these conflicts. 

The last Zhou king is traditionally taken to be [[King Nan of Zhou|Nan]], who was killed when [[Qin state|Qin]] captured the capital [[Chengzhou]] in 256 BC. A &quot;[[Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou|King Hui]]&quot; was declared, but his splinter state was fully removed by 249 BC. Qin's [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] concluded in 221 BC with [[Qin Shihuang]]'s annexation of [[Qi (state)|Qi]].

The Eastern Zhou, however, is also remembered as the golden age of Chinese philosophy: the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] which flourished as rival lords patronized itinerant ''[[Four_occupations#The_shi_.28.E5.A3.AB.29|shi]]'' scholars is led by the example of [[Qi (state)|Qi]]'s [[Jixia Academy]]. The [[Nine Schools of Thought]] which came to dominate the others were [[Confucianism]] (as interpreted by [[Mencius]] and others), [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], the utopian communalist [[Agriculturalism]], two strains of [[school of Diplomacy|Diplomatists]], the sophistic [[School of Names|Logicians]], [[Sun-tzu]]'s [[School of the Military|Militarists]], and the [[School of Naturalists|Naturalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chiphi&quot;&gt;.Carr, Brian &amp; al. ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=osxPipnXeN0C&amp;pg=PA466 Companion Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy],'' p. 466. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2012. ISBN: 041503535X, 9780415035354.&lt;/ref&gt; Although only the first three of these went on to receive imperial patronage in later dynasties, doctrines from each influenced the others and Chinese society in sometimes unusual ways. The [[Mohism|Mohists]], for instance, found little interest in their praise of meritocracy but much acceptance for their mastery of siege warfare; much later, however, their arguments against nepotism were used in favor of establishing the [[imperial exam]]ination system.

==Culture and society==
===Feudalism and the rise of Confucian bureaucracy===

[[Image:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze gui.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Western Zhou ceremonial bronze of cooking-vessel form inscribed to record that the King of Zhou gave a fiefdom to Shi You, ordering that he inherit the title as well as the land and people living there]]
Western writers often describe the Zhou period as &quot;[[Feudalism|feudal]]&quot; because the Zhou's ''[[fēngjiàn]]'' (封建) system invites comparison with [[Middle Ages|medieval rule in Europe]].

There were many similarities between the decentralized systems. When the dynasty was established, the conquered land was divided into hereditary fiefs ({{lang|zh|諸侯}}, ''zhūhóu'') that eventually became powerful in their own right.  The fiefs or states themselves tended to become feudally subdivided. There were [[Chinese_nobility#Peer_ranks_of_the_Zhou_Dynasty|five peerage ranks]] below the royal ranks, in descending order with common English translations: ''gōng'' 公 &quot;duke&quot;, ''hóu'' 侯 &quot;marquis&quot;, ''bó'' 伯 &quot;count&quot;, ''zǐ'' 子 &quot;viscount&quot;, and ''nán'' 男 &quot;baron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ChinaKnowledge.de encyclopedia, http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a vigorous duke would take power from his nobles and centralize the state. Centralization became more necessary as the states began to war among themselves and decentralization encouraged more war. If a duke took power from his nobles, the state would have to be administered bureaucratically by appointed officials.

Despite these similarities, there are a number of important differences from medieval Europe. One obvious difference is that the Zhou ruled from walled cities rather than castles. Another was China's distinct class system, which lacked an organized clergy but saw the Shang [[Zi (surname)|Zi]]-clan yeomen become masters of ritual and ceremony known as ''Shi'' (士). When a dukedom was centralized these people would find employment as government officials or officers. These hereditary classes were similar to Western knights in status and breeding, but like Western clergy were expected to be something of a scholar instead of a warrior. Being appointed, they could move from one state to another. Some would travel from state to state peddling schemes of administrative or military reform. Those who could not find employment would often end up teaching young men who aspired to official status. The most famous of these was [[Confucius]], who taught a system of mutual duty between superiors and inferiors. In contrast, the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] had no time for Confucian virtue and advocated a system of strict laws and harsh punishments. The wars of the Warring States were finally ended by the most legalist state of all, Qin. When the [[Qin Dynasty]] fell and was replaced by the [[Han Dynasty]], many Chinese were relieved to return to the more humane virtues of Confucius.

===Military===
The early Western Zhou supported a strong army, split into two major units: &quot;the Six Armies of the west&quot; and &quot;the Eight Armies of Chengzhou&quot;. The armies campaigned in the northern [[Loess Plateau]], modern [[Ningxia]] and the [[Yellow River]] floodplain. The military prowess of Zhou peaked during the 19th year of [[King Zhao of Zhou|King Zhao]]'s reign, when the six armies were wiped out along with King Zhao on a campaign around the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]].  Early Zhou kings were true commanders-in-chief. They were in constant wars with barbarians on behalf of the fiefs called ''guo'', meaning &quot;statelet&quot; or &quot;principality.&quot;

King Zhao was famous for repeated campaigns in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] areas and died in his last action. Later kings' campaigns were less effective. [[King Li of Zhou|King Li]] led 14 armies against [[barbarians]] in the south, but failed to achieve any victory. [[King Xuan of Zhou|King Xuan]] fought the [[Quanrong]] nomads in vain. [[King You of Zhou|King You]] was killed by the Quanrong when Haojing was sacked. Although [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariots]] had been introduced to China during the Shang Dynasty from Central Asia, the Zhou period saw the first major use of chariots in battle.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988}}

===Mandate of Heaven===
[[Image:Western Zhou Gui Vessel.jpg|thumb|200px|A Western Zhou bronze gui vessel, c. 1000 BC]]

In the Chinese historical tradition, the Zhou defeated the Shang and oriented the Shang system of [[ancestor worship]] towards a universalized worship, away from the worship of [[Shangdi]] and to that of [[Tian]] or &quot;heaven&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Phillip|title=The Mandate of Heaven|url=http://china.mrdonn.org/mandateofheaven.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They legitimized their rule by invoking the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]],&quot; the notion that the ruler (the &quot;[[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]&quot;) governed by divine right and that his dethronement would prove that he had lost the Mandate. [[Disaster]]s and successful rebellions would thus show that the ruling family had lost this Mandate.

The doctrine explained and justified the demise of the [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] and Shang dynasties and, at the same time, supported the legitimacy of present and future rulers. Before conquering Shang, Zhou was a state in [[Shaanxi]].  {{Harvcoltxt|Gernet|1996|p=51}} describes the Zhou state as a &quot;city&quot; which was in contact with the barbarian peoples of the western regions and more warlike than the Shang. The Zhou dynasty was founded by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] family and operated from four capitals throughout its history.{{sfnp|Khayutina|2003}} Sharing the language and culture of the Shang, the early Zhou rulers, through conquest and colonization, established a large imperial territory wherein states as far as [[Shandong]] acknowledged Zhou rulership and took part in elite culture. The spread of Zhou bronzes, though, was concurrent with the continued use of Shang-style pottery in the distant regions, and these states were the last to recede during the late Western war. The mandate of heaven was based on rules. The emperor was granted the right to rule by heaven.

===Philosophy===
During the Zhou Dynasty, the origins of native [[Chinese philosophy]] developed, its initial stages beginning in the 6th century BC. The greatest Chinese philosophers, those who made the greatest impact on later generations of Chinese, were [[Confucius]], founder of [[Confucianism]], and [[Laozi]], founder of [[Taoism]]. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were [[Mozi]], founder of [[Mohism]]; [[Mencius]], a famous Confucian who expanded upon Confucius' legacy; [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], responsible for the development of ancient Chinese [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (the core philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]]); and [[Xun Zi]], who was arguably the center of ancient Chinese intellectual life during his time, even more so than iconic intellectual figures such as Mencius.{{sfnp|Schirokauer|Brown|2006|pp=25–47}}

===Li===
{{Main|Li (Confucian)}}
Established during the Western period, the ''Li'' {{CJKV|t=禮|s=礼|p=lǐ}}) ritual system
encoded an understanding of manners as an expression of the social hierarchy, ethics, and regulation concerning material life; the corresponding social practices became idealized within Confucian ideology.

The system was canonized in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', [[Zhou li|''Zhouli'']], and [[Yili (text)|''Yili'']] compendiums of the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD), thus becoming the heart of the Chinese imperial ideology. While the system was initially a respected body of concrete regulations, the fragmentation of the Western Zhou period led the ritual to drift towards moralization and formalization in regard to:

* The five orders of [[Chinese nobility]].
* Ancestral temples (size, legitimate number of pavilions)
* Ceremonial regulations (number of [[Ding (vessel)|ritual vessels]], musical instruments, people in the dancing troupe)

===Agriculture===
[[Image:ZhouVase.JPG|thumb|200px|Zhou vase with glass inlays, 4th-3rd century BC, [[British Museum]].]]
Agriculture in the Zhou Dynasty was very intensive and, in many cases, directed by the government. All farming lands were owned by nobles, who then gave their land to their serfs, a situation similar to European [[feudalism]]. For example, a piece of land was divided into nine squares in the [[well-field system]], with the grain from the middle square taken by the government and that of surrounding squares kept by individual farmers. This way, the government was able to store surplus food and distribute it in times of famine or bad harvest. Some important manufacturing sectors during this period included bronze smelting, which was integral to making weapons and farming tools. Again, these industries were dominated by the nobility who directed the production of such materials.

China's first projects of [[hydraulic engineering]] were initiated during the Zhou Dynasty, ultimately as a means to aid agricultural [[irrigation]]. The [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Sunshu Ao]], who served [[King Zhuang of Chu]], dammed a river to create an enormous irrigation [[reservoir]] in modern-day northern [[Anhui]] province. For this, Sunshu is credited as China's first hydraulic engineer. The later Wei statesman [[Ximen Bao]], who served [[Marquis Wen of Wei]] (445-396 BC), was the first hydraulic engineer of China to have created a large irrigation canal system. As the main focus of his grandiose project, his canal work eventually diverted the waters of the entire [[Zhang River]] to a spot further up the [[Yellow River]].

==Kings==
{{anchor|kings|list of kings|list of rulers}}
The rulers of the Zhou dynasty were titled ''[[wang (title)|Wang]]'' ({{lang|zh|王}}) like the [[Shang_Dynasty#Kings|Shang rulers]] before them. The position is normally translated into English as &quot;king&quot;, although sometimes the later title of &quot;[[emperor of China|emperor]]&quot; is also used. In addition to these rulers, King Wu's immediate ancestors {{ndash}} [[Gugong Danfu|Danfu]], [[Ji Jili|Jili]], and [[King Wen of Zhou|Wen]] {{ndash}} are also referred to as &quot;Kings of Zhou&quot;, despite having been nominal vassals of the Shang kings under the titles &quot;[[gong (title)|Duke]]&quot; ({{lang|zh|公}}) or &quot;Count of the West&quot; ({{lang|zh|西伯}}).

NB: Dates in Chinese history before the first year of the [[Gonghe Regency]] in 841 BC are contentious and vary by source. Those below are those published by the PRC's official [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]].

The remaining Ji family ruled [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wei]] until 209 BC.
