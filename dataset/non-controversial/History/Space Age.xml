The '''Space Age''' is a time period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age is generally considered to have begun with [[Sputnik]] (1957). Furthermore it is argued that this age brought a new dimension to the [[Cold War]].

==Beginning==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated on October&amp;nbsp;4, 1957, with the launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik&amp;nbsp;1]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83&amp;nbsp;kg. The launch of Sputnik&amp;nbsp;1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. 

The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the US and the Soviet Union. Rapid advances were made in [[rocket]]ry, [[materials science]], [[computer]]s and other areas. Much of the technology originally developed for space applications has been [[Government spin-off|spun off]] and found other uses.

The Space Age reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]], that captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11|Apollo&amp;nbsp;11]] was watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then, public attention has largely moved to other areas. Public perception of the dangers and cost of [[space exploration]] in the US was greatly affected by the [[Challenger disaster]] in 1986. Public interest in space exploration further faded when the space race came to an end due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

During the 1990s funding for space related programs fell sharply as the remaining structures of the Soviet Union disintegrated and NASA no longer had any direct competition. 

Since then participation in space launches has increasingly widened to more governments and commercial interests. Since the 1990s, the current period has more often been referred to as the [[Information Age]] rather than the Space Age, since space exploration and space-related technologies gained a perception by many people of being commonplace.

==Current period==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
In the early 21st century, the [[Ansari X Prize]] competition was set up to help jump start [[private spaceflight]], which was won by [[Space Ship One]] in 2004, becoming the first spaceship not funded by a government agency.

Several countries now have space programs; from related technology ventures to full fledged space programs with launch facilities. There are many scientific and commercial satellites in use today, with a total of hundreds of [[satellite]]s in orbit, and several countries have plans to send humans into space.

==Earlier spaceflights==
The Space Age might also be considered to have begun much earlier than October 4, 1957, because on October 3, 1942, a German [[Aggregate series|A4]] rocket, a prototype version of the [[V-2 rocket]] program, reached space. It thus became the first man-made object to enter [[outer space|space]], albeit only briefly.  Since this flight was undertaken in secrecy, it was not public knowledge for many years afterwards.  Further, the German launch, as well as the subsequent [[sounding rocket]] tests performed in both the United States and the Soviet Union during the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not considered significant enough to start a new age because they did not reach orbit.  Having a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit meant that a nation had the ability to place a payload anywhere on the planet, or to use another term, possessed an [[inter-continental ballistic missile]].  The fact that after such a development nowhere on the planet was safe from a nuclear warhead is why the orbit standard is used to define when the space age started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
