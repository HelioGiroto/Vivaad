{{History of Serbia}}

The '''history of [[Serbia]]''', as a country, begins with the [[Slavs#Slavic migrations|Slavic settlements]] in the [[Balkans]], established in the 6th century in territories governed by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Through the centuries, the Serbian realm evolved into a Kingdom (1217), then an Empire (1345), before the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] annexed it in 1540. Several minor or unsuccessful revolts took place against Ottoman rule, with brief independence gained in the northern regions in the 18th century. In 1804 the [[Serbian Revolution]] began, resulting in the liberation of Serbia. In 1918, Yugoslavia was established as a confederation of South Slavic nations. In 1991, Yugoslavia was dissolved, with [[Serbia and Montenegro]] continuing the federation. As of 2006, Serbia exists under the name of &quot;Republic of Serbia&quot;.

In prehistoric times, the [[Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] and [[Vinča culture]]s existed in or near [[Belgrade]] and dominated the [[Balkans]] (as well as parts of Central Europe and [[Asia Minor]]) in 6200–4500 BC. The [[Paleo-Balkan]] tribes evolved in the 2nd and 1st millennia BC. The northernmost [[Ancient Macedonians|Ancient Macedonian]] city was in south Serbia ([[Kale-Krševica]]). The Celtic [[Scordisci]] tribe conquered most of Serbia in 279 BC, building many forts throughout the region. The Roman Empire conquered the region in the span of 2nd century BC-1st century AD. The Romans continued the expansion of [[Singidunum]] (modern capital Belgrade), [[Sirmium]] ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) and [[Naissus]] (Niš), among other centres, and a few notable remnants of monuments survive, such as [[Via Militaris]], [[Trajan's Bridge]], [[Diana Fortress|Diana]], [[Felix Romuliana]] ([[World Heritage sites in Serbia|UNESCO]]), etc.

Slavs formed ''[[Sklavinia]]'' beginning in the 6th century, out of which the [[First Serbian Principality]] of the [[Vlastimirović dynasty|Vlastimirovići]] emerged. It evolved into [[Serbian Grand Principality|a Grand Principality]] by the 11th century, and in 1217, the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and national church ([[Serbian Orthodox Church]]) were established, under the [[Nemanjić dynasty|Nemanjići]]. In 1345, the [[Serbian Empire]] was established: it spanned a large part of the Balkans. In 1540 the [[Ottoman Empire]] annexed Serbia.

The Serbian realms disappeared by the mid-16th century, torn by domestic feuds, and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest. The success of the [[Serbian revolution]] against [[Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]] in 1817 marked the birth of the [[Principality of Serbia]], which achieved ''de facto'' independence in 1867 and  finally gained recognition by the Great Powers in the [[Berlin Congress|Berlin Congress of 1878]]. As a victor in the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1913, Serbia regained [[Vardar Macedonia]], Kosovo and [[Raška (region)|Raška]] (''[[Old Serbia]]''). In 1918, the region of [[Vojvodina]] proclaimed its [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja|secession]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] to unite with the pan-Slavic [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union on 1 December 1918, and the country was named [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. In 1918, Serbia was recognized as a state by the world for the first time.

Serbia achieved its current borders after World War II, when it became a federal unit within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. After the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] in [[Yugoslav wars|a series of wars]] in the 1990s, Serbia once again became an independent state on 5 June 2006, following the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|breakup]] of a [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|short-lived union]] with Montenegro.

==Prehistory==
{{main|Prehistoric Serbia}}

The [[Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] and [[Vinča culture]]s existed in or near Belgrade and dominated the [[Balkans]] (as well as parts of Central Europe and [[Asia Minor]]) about 8,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vinca&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Nikola Tasić |coauthors=Dragoslav Srejović, Bratislav Stojanović |editor=Vladislav Popović | other = Smiljka Kjurin (translator) |title=Vinča: Centre of the Neolithic culture of the Danubian region |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vinca/vinca_eng.html |accessdate=2006-10-28 |year=1990 |location=Belgrade |chapter=Vinča and its Culture | chapterurl = http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vinca/vinca_eng.html#_Toc504111710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ancient&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201172|title=History (Ancient Period)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the prehistoric [[Vinča signs]] represent one of the earliest known forms of [[writing system]]s (dating to 6000–4000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iWlpqkVMX2YC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5|title=Year's Work in English Studies Volume 77|last=Kitson|first=Peter|page=5|isbn=978-0-631-21293-5|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbia's strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples. [[Greeks]] colonized its south in the 11th century BC, the northernmost point of the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] being the town of [[Kale-Krsevica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blic.rs&quot;&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/kultura.php?id=53049 Blic Online Kultura | Najseverniji grad Aleksandrovog carstva]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Thracians]] dominated Serbia before the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] migration in the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;IWilkes, J.

==Roman era==
{{main|Roman era Serbia}}
{{Further|Moesia|Pannonia|Dalmatia|Dacia|Macedonia (region)}}

The Romans conquered parts of Serbia in the 2nd century BC, in 167 BC when conquering the West, establishing the province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and the rest of Central Serbia in 75 BC, establishing the province of [[Moesia]]. [[Srem]] was conquered by 9 BC and [[Bačka]] and [[Banat]] in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]].

Contemporary Serbia comprises the [[Classical Greece|classical]] regions of [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], parts of [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonia region&quot;&gt;[[Macedonia (region)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The northern Serbian city of [[Sirmium]] (''Sremska Mitrovica'') was among the top 4 cities of the late [[Roman Empire]], serving as its capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hrcak.srce.hr&quot;&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=14662 Hrčak – Scrinia Slavonica, Vol.2 No.1 Listopad 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] were: [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), [[Viminacium]] (sometimes called municipium Aelium; modern [[Kostolac]]), Remesiana ([[Bela Palanka]])

==Byzantine era==
{{expand section|date=January 2012}}
Around the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] appeared on the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] borders in great numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/mango.html Cyril Mango. Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome. Scribner's, 1980.]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic people have been under nominal [[Serbs|Serbian rule]] since the 7th century. They were allowed to settle in the Byzantine Empire by its emperor [[Heraclius]] after their victory over the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/1_3_l.html |title=Istorija srpskog naroda: Sloveni naseljavaju Balkan |author=Vladimir Corovic |publisher=Projekat Rastko: Biblioteka srpske kulture |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages (768–1459)==
{{main|Serbia in the Middle Ages}}
{{See also|List of Serbian monarchs}}

===Serbia under the Vlastimirović dynasty===
{{main|Principality of Serbia (medieval)}}
The Serbs, a [[Slavic people]], specifically of the [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] subgroup, have their origins in the 6th and 7th century communities developed in Southeastern Europe (see [[great migration of the Slavs|Great Migration]]). Slav raids on Eastern Roman territory are mentioned in 518, and by the 580s they had conquered large areas referred to as ''[[Sclavinia]]'' (&lt;small&gt;transl.&lt;/small&gt; ''Slavdom'', from ''[[Sklavenoi]]'' – Σκλαυηνοι, the early South Slavic tribe which is eponymous to the current ethnic and linguistic Indo-European people).&lt;ref name=SLAVY&gt;&quot;Slavyane v rannem srednevekovie&quot; Valentin V. Sedov (Russian language), Archaeological institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Balkans850.png|thumb|right|200px|The Serb Archonty c. 850.]]

[[Višeslav of Serbia|Prince Višeslav]] (fl. 768–814), the first known Serbian monarch by name, ruled the hereditary lands ([[Župa]]nias, ''counties'') of ''[[Neretva]], [[Tara Mountain|Tara]], [[Piva, Montenegro|Piva]], [[Lim River|Lim]]''. He managed to unite several more provinces and tribes into what is subsequently known as ''Rascia'' (the future crownland of the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]]). Višeslav was succeeded by his son [[Radoslav of Serbia|Radoslav]] and then [[Prosigoj]], during which time &quot;the Serbs inhabit the greater part of [[Dalmatia]]&quot; ([[Royal Frankish Annals]], 822). At this time, there was peace with the eastern neighbours the [[Bulgars]], who had begun to expand their territory significantly. Prosigoj's son, [[Vlastimir of Serbia|Prince Vlastimir]], further expanded the realm, which prompted the Bulgars, who had already taken parts of Macedonia, to invade in 839. The invasion led to a three-year-war, which ended in 842, with a decisive Serbian victory. The Bulgars were driven out and Vlastimir expanded to the west and south; meanwhile, the Bulgars had taken most of modern Serbia's east. [[Mutimir of Serbia|Prince Mutimir]] (r. 851–891),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.rs/sr-l/1998/03/article-06.html Srpsko Nasledje]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Vlastimir, managed to defeat the Bulgars once again in 834–835, also capturing the son of the Bulgar Khan. The Serbs and Bulgars concluded peace, and the Christianization of the Slavs began; by the 870s the Serbs were baptized and had established the [[Eparchy of Ras]], on the order of Emperor [[Basil I]]. The remaining years well into the 920s are characterized by civil wars; these were succession wars between the branches of the [[Vlastimirović Dynasty]].

[[Petar Gojniković]] managed to defeat his cousin, the reigning Prince [[Pribislav Mutimirović]], in 892. Petar was recognized by the Bulgars, now the greatest power in the Balkans, although the peace was not to last; the Byzantines had sent an envoy to Serbia promising greater independence in return for Petar leading an army against the Bulgars. A Bulgarian ally, [[Michael Višević]], who had seen a threat in Petar during the latter's conquering of Bosnia and Neretva, heard of the possible alliance and warned the Bulgarian Khan, who later sent a protege, [[Pavle Branović]], to rule Serbia. In the meantime, [[Zaharija Pribislavljević]] was sent by the Byzantines to take the Serbian throne. He was, however, captured by Pavle and sent to Bulgaria. Pavle was now approached by the Byzantines, thus Zaharija was indoctrinated by the Bulgars. Pavle planned an attack on Bulgaria, but Khan Simeon was warned, and dispatched Zaharija with an army, promising him the throne if he defeats Pavle, which he did. Zaharija soon resumed his Byzantine alliance, also uniting several Slavic tribes along the common border to revolt against the Bulgars, several Bulgarian generals were beheaded, their heads sent to Constantinople by Zaharija as a symbol of alleigance. In 924 a large army led by [[Časlav Klonimirović]], the second cousin, was sent by the Bulgars which ravaged Serbia, forcing Zaharija to exile. Instead of instating Časlav, the Bulgars annexed Serbia 924–927. 

Časlav took the throne in 927, with the death of the Bulgar Khan, and immediately put himself under Byzantine overlordship. Eastern Christian (Orthodox) influence greatly increaseds and the two maintained close ties throughout his regn. He enlarged Serbia, uniting the tribes of Bosnia, [[Herzegovina]], [[Old Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] (incorporated [[Pagania]], [[Zahumlje]], [[Travunia]],&lt;ref name=SC209&gt;The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konavle]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Rascia]] into [[Serbia]], '''ι Σερβλια''').&lt;ref name=EB160&gt;The early medieval Balkans, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; He took over regions previously held by Michael Višević, who disappeared from sources in 925.&lt;ref name=SC209/&gt; The [[De Administrando Imperio]] describes his realm: the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], the [[Sava river]] and the [[Morava river|Morava valley]] as well as today's northern [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snaga.org.yu/Ilustrovana_istorija_srba/tekst/engleski/01/01-06-doseljavanje-slovena.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After Časlav's death, the realm crumbled; local nobles restored the control of each province. Soon the [[Croats]], [[Bulgarians]] and Byzantines annexed the Serbian territories. The written information about the first dynasty ends with the death of Časlav.&lt;ref name=SVHB1&gt;Srbi između Vizantije, Hrvatske i Bugarske;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catepanate of Ras]] was established between 971–976, during the rule of [[John Tzimiskes]] (r. 969–976).&lt;ref&gt;GK, Abstract: ''&quot;the establishment of catepanate in Ras between 971 and 976&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; A seal of a ''[[strategos]]'' of Ras has been dated to Tzimiskes' reign, making it possible for Tzimiskes' predecessor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] to have enjoyed recognition in Rascia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Stephenson | first = Paul | title = The Legend of Basil the Bulgar-slayer | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Z0PmrXKnczUC&amp;pg=PA42 | page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Magdalino, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CSZQ-VPFKoMC&amp;pg=PA122 Byzantium in the year 1000], p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The ''protospatharios and katepano of Ras'' was a Byzantine governor named John.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=kw4rAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tzimiskes+ras&lt;/ref&gt; Data on the ''katepano'' of Ras during Tzimiskes' reign is missing.&lt;ref&gt;Bojana Krsmanović, Ljubomir Maksimović, Taxiarchis G. Kolias (2008), [http://books.google.com/books?id=kjsjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tzimiskes+ras ''The Byzantine province in change: on the threshold between the 10th and the 11th century''], p. 189, Institute for Byzantine Studies, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts,&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine military presence ended soon thereafter with the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|wars with Bulgaria]], and was re-established only ca. 1018 with the short-lived [[Theme of Sirmium]], which however did not extend much into Rascia proper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;/&gt;

In the 990s, [[Jovan Vladimir]] emerged at the most powerful Serbian noble. With his court centered in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] on the Adriatic coast, he had much of the Serbian ''Pomorje'' ('maritime') under his control including [[Travunia]] and [[Zachlumia]]. His realm may have stretched west- and northwards to include some parts of the ''Zagorje'' (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir's pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil II approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Emperor Basil required allies for his war against [[Tsar Samuel]], who had much of [[Macedionia (region)|Macedonia]]. In retaliation, Samuel invaded Duklja in 997, and pushed through [[Dalmatia]] up to the city of [[Zadar]], incorporating [[Bosnia]] and [[Serbia]] into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a [[vassal]] Prince. Following Basil's conquest of Bulgaria in 1018, Serbia passed under Byzantine rule again.

===Serbia under the Vojislavljević dynasty===
{{main|Duklja}}
{{expand section|date=January 2012}}
Around 1040 A.D. a Byzantine army sent by Constantine Monomachus was destroyed by the Serbian army led by Vojislav, which resulted in liberation of [[Duklja]] (Overthrowing of Byzantine supremacy). Duklja then assumed domination over the Serbian lands between the 11th and 12th centuries under the [[Vojislavljević dynasty]]. In 1077 AD,  Duklja became the first Serbian Kingdom, under [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Michael I]], the &quot;ruler of Tribals and Serbs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njegos.org/medieval/mihailo.htm Fresco of King Mihailo]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2012}}

===Serbia under the Nemanjić dynasty===
From late 12th century onwards, a new state called [[Raška (state)|Raska]], centred in present-day southern Serbia, rose to become the paramount Serb state. Over the 13th and 14th centuries, it ruled over the other Serb lands (the [[Hum (Pešter)|Hum]], [[Travunia]] and [[Duklja]]/[[Zeta]]. During this time, Serbia began to expand eastward (toward [[Niš]]), southward into [[Kosovo]] and northern [[Region of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and northward toward [[Srem]] and [[Macva]] for the first time. This shift away from the Adriatic coast brought Serbia increasingly under the influence of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], although a substantial proportion of Catholics were found in the coastal regions. Although Europe had already experience the [[East-West Schism]] by this time, such a split was far less concrete than it is today, and Catholic Slavs in Bosnia and the Dalmatian coast practiced Christianity in a similar way to Orthodox Slavs – priests married, wore beards and gave liturgy in Slavic rather than Latin. By the beginning of the 14th century Serbs lived in three distinctly independent kingdoms- [[Duklja|Dioclea]], [[Raška (state)|Rascia]] and [[Syrmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.njegos.org/medieval/mihailo.htm |title=Fresco of King Mihailo |publisher=Serb Land of Montenegro }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serbianunity.net/culture/history/Serb_History/nemanjici.html |title=Serbian Medieval History |year=2006 |publisher=Serbian Unity Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko-bo/istorija/srednjivek/nserovic-tvrtko_l.html |title=Stefan Tvrtko I Kotromanić |author=Nenad Šerović |publisher=Projekat Rastko: Biblioteka srpske kulture |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nemanja StefanP Sebia200.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nemanjić's Serbia, 1150–1220, during the rules of [[Stefan Nemanja]] and [[Stefan Prvovenčani]].]]

Led by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], medieval Serbia reached its military, economic and legal climax. The [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]] was proclaimed in 1217. Direct result of this was the establishment of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1219. In the same year [[Saint Sava]] published the first constitution in Serbia – [[Zakonopravilo]] (St. Sava's Nomocanon).

[[Tsar Dušan|Stefan Dušan]] proclaimed the [[Serbian Empire]] in 1346. During Dušan's rule, Serbia reached its territorial, political and economical peak, proclaiming itself as the successor of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and indeed was the most powerful Balkan state of that time. [[Dušan's Code|Tsar Dušan enacted the known ''Dušan's Code'', an extensive constitution]], and opened new trade routes and strengthened the state's economy. Serbia flourished, becoming one of the most developed countries and cultures in Europe. Medieval Serbia had a high political, economic, and cultural reputation in Europe. The Serbian identity has been profoundly shaped by the rule of this dynasty and its accomplishments, with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] who assumed the role of the national spiritual guardian.

[[File:Byzantine empire 1355.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Serbian Empire]], 1355 A.D.]]

Before his sudden death, Stefan Dušan tried to organize a Crusade with the Pope against the threatening Turks. He died in December 1355 at the age 47. He was succeeded by his son [[Stefan Uros V|Uroš]], called ''the Weak'', a term that might also apply to the state of the empire which slowly slided into a feudal anarchy. This was a period marked by the rise of a new threat: the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk sultanate]] which spread from Asia to Europe. They conquered [[Byzantium]] and then the other states in the [[Balkans]].

===Fall of Serbia===
[[File:Central balkans 1373 1395.png|thumb|right|200px|Serbian realms 1373–1395.]]

Two Barons in the Serbian region, Mrnjavčević brothers, gathered a large army to repel the Ottomans. They marched into Ottoman territory in 1371 to attack the Turks, but they were too self-confident. They built an overnight camp near the river [[Maritsa]] at Chernomen in today's [[Bulgaria]], and started celebrating the victory in advance, and eventually got drunk. During the night, a detachment of Ottoman forces attacked the drunk Serbian knights and pushed them to the river. Most of the knights were either killed or drowned. This battle became known as the [[Battle of Maritsa]]. The result of this battle was that Serbs lost control over the south half of their former empire.

In [[Battle of Plocnik|Battle of Pločnik]] in 1386, Serbian forces defeated the Ottoman army. But, the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 was the turning point of the war between the Serbs and the Turks. Serbian armoured horseman, commanded by [[Prince Lazar]] – the strongest regional nobleman in Serbia at the time, had the advantage in the battle. Lazar's vassal Obilić killed the Ottoman sultan [[Murad I]]. Eventually, Murad's son [[Bayezid I]] retreated the rest of his troops from the battlefield, so it was the Serbian victory. But, the Serbian losses were so heavy and the result of this battle was a catastrophe for the Serbs. The Battle of Kosovo defined the fate of the medieval Serbia. After the battle there was no force in the [[Balkans]] capable of standing up to the Ottoman Turks. Kosovo was taken by the Ottomans in the following years and the Serbian realm was moved northwards. That unstable period was marked by the rule of Prince Lazar's son, despot [[Stefan Lazarević]], a true European-style knight and a poet; and his cousin [[Đurađ Branković]], who moved the capital north to the newly built fortified town of [[Smederevo]]. The Ottomans continued their conquest until they finally seized the entire northern medieval Serbia in 1459, when Smederevo fell into their hands.

==Ottoman Occupation 1459–1878==
{{Main|History of Ottoman Serbia}}
Medieval Bosnia and Zeta lasted until 1496. A Serbian principality was restored a few years after the fall of the Serbian despotate by the Brankovics and existed as a Hungarian dependency situated in what is now Vojvodina and the northern Hungary/Romania. It was ruled by exiled Serbian nobles and existed until 1540 when it fell to the Ottomans.

From the 14th century onward an increasing number of Serbs began migrating to the north to the region today known as [[Vojvodina]], which was under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in that time. The Hungarian kings encouraged the immigration of Serbs to the kingdom, and hired many of them as soldiers and border guards. During the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and Hungary, this Serb population performed an attempt of the restoration of the Serbian state. In the [[Battle of Mohács]] on 29 August 1526, [[Ottoman Empire]] destroyed the army of [[Hungary|Hungarian]]&amp;ndash;[[Czech Republic|Czech]] king [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis Jagellion]], who was killed on the battlefield. After this battle [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] ceased to be independent state and much of its former territory became part of the Ottoman Empire. Soon after the Battle of Mohács, leader of Serbian mercenaries in Hungary, [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]] established his rule in [[Bačka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Srem (region)|Srem]] (These three regions are now parts of [[Vojvodina]]). He created an ephemeral independent state, with city of [[Subotica]] as its capital. At the peak of his career, Jovan Nenad crowned himself in Subotica for Serb emperor. King [[János Szapolyai|John of Hungary]] forces defeated his rebellion in the summer of 1527. Jovan Nenad was killed and his 'state' collapsed.

European powers, and Austria in particular, fought many wars against the Ottoman Empire, sometimes with assistance from Serbs. During the Austrian–Ottoman War (1593–1606), in 1594, some Serbs participated an uprising in Banat—the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian]] part of the Ottoman Empire, and Sultan [[Murad III]] retaliated by burning the relics of St. Sava. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Austria established troops in [[Herzegovina]] but when peace was signed by Ottoman Empire and Austria, Austria abandoned to Ottoman vengeance. This sequence of events became customary for the centuries that followed.

During the Great War (1683–90) between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Holy League (Great Ottoman war)|Holy League]]—created with the sponsorship of the Pope and including Austria, Poland and [[Venice]]—these three powers as means of divide and conquer strategy, incited including Serbs to rebel against the Ottoman authorities and soon uprisings and terrorism spread throughout the western Balkans: from [[Montenegro]] and the [[Dalmatian Coast]] to the [[Danube]] basin and Old Serbia (Macedonia, Raška, Kosovo and Metohija). However, when the Austrians started to pull out of the Ottoman region, they invited Austrian-loyal people to come north with them into Hungarian territories. Having to choose between Ottoman reprisal or living in Hungary, some Serbs abandoned their homesteads and headed north led by [[patriarch]] [[Arsenije Čarnojević]].

Another important episode in the history of the region took place in 1716–18, when the territories ranging from Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to Belgrade and the Danube basin became the battleground for a new Austria-Ottoman war launched by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. Some Serbs sided once again with Austria. After a peace treaty was signed in Požarevac, the Ottomans lost all its possessions in the Danube basin, as well as today's northern Serbia and northern Bosnia, parts of Dalmatia and the [[Peloponnesus]].

The last Austrian-Ottoman war was the so-called [[Dubica war]] (1788–91), when the Austrians urged the Christians in Bosnia to rebel. No wars were fought afterwards until the 20th century that marked the fall of both Austrian and Ottoman empires, staged together by the European powers/imperialism just after World War I.

===Serbian Revolution 1804–1817===
{{Main|History of Serbia 1804-1918}}
{{see also|Serbian revolution}}

[[File:Karađorđe Petrović, by Vladimir Borovikovsky, 1816.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Leader of first Serbian uprising, [[Karađorđe Petrović]] circa 1810.]]

Serbia gained its autonomy from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in two uprisings in [[First Serbian Uprising|1804]] (led by [[Đorđe Petrović]] – Karađorđe) and [[Second Serbian Uprising|1815]] (led by [[Miloš Obrenović]]), although Turkish troops continued to garrison the capital, [[Belgrade]], until 1867. The Turkish Empire was already faced with a deep internal crisis without any hope of recuperating. This had a particularly hard effect on the orthodox nations living under its rule. The Serbs launched not only a national revolution but a social one as well.

===Autonomous Principality 1817–1878===

In 1817 Principality of Serbia was granted de facto independence from the Ottoman Empire.

==Independent Serbia 1878–1918==
[[File:SouthEast Europe 1878.jpg|thumb|220px|Serbian gains from the treaty of Berlin, in 1878]]
The Autonomous Principality became an internationally recognized independent country following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1878. Serbia remained a [[principality]] or ''kneževina'' (''knjaževina''), until 1882 when it became a Kingdom, during which the internal politics revolved largely around dynastic rivalry between the [[Obrenović]] and [[Karađorđević]] families.

This period was marked by the alternation of two dynasties descending from [[Đorđe Petrović]]—Karađorđe, leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] and [[Miloš Obrenović]], leader of the [[Second Serbian Uprising]]. Further development of Serbia was characterized by general progress in economy, culture and arts, primarily due to a wise state policy of sending young people to European capitals to get an education. They all brought back a new spirit and a new system of values.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} One of the external manifestations of the transformation that the former Turkish province was going through was the proclamation of the Province of Serbia in 1882.

[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|220px|Southern and Northern Serbia ([[Vojvodina]]) in 1848.]]
[[File:Serbia02.png|thumb|220px|Southern and Northern Serbia (Vojvodina) in 1849.]]

During the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the Serbs in the [[Austrian Empire]] proclaimed Serbian autonomous province known as [[Serbian Vojvodina]]. By a decision of the Austrian emperor, in November 1849, this province was transformed into the Austrian crown land known as the [[Vojvodina of Serbia and Tamiš Banat]] (Dukedom of Serbia and Tamiš Banat). Against the will of the Serbs, the province was abolished in 1860, but the Serbs from the region gained another opportunity to achieve their political demands in 1918. Today, this region is known as [[Vojvodina]].

In 1885, Serbia was against the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern [[Rumelia]] and attacked Bulgaria. This is also known as [[Serbo-Bulgarian war]]. Despite better weapons and skilled commanders, Serbia lost the war.

In the second half of 19th century, Serbia gained statehood as the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. It thus became part of the constellation of European states and the first political parties were founded, thus giving new momentum to political life. The [[May Overthrow]] in 1903, bringing Karađorđe's grandson to the throne with the title of King [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar I]] opened the way for parliamentary democracy in Serbia. Having received a European education, this liberal king translated &quot;[[On Liberty]]&quot; by [[John Stuart Mill]] and gave his country a democratic constitution. It initiated a period of parliamentary government and political freedom interrupted by the outbreak of the liberation wars. The [[Balkan wars]] 1912–13, terminated the Turkish domination in the Balkans. Turkey was pushed back towards the Bosporus, and national Balkan states were created in the territories it withdrew from. Even though Serbia at the beginning was part of a united alliance of Balkan powers against the Ottomans the initial victory led to squabbles about the division of the spoils and in the second of the two wars it was Bulgaria who was Serbia's main enemy.

===Serbia in World War I===
{{Main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Home front during World War I}}
Despite its small size and population of 4.6 million, Serbia had the most effective manpower mobilization of the war, and had a highly professional officer corps. It called 350,000 men to arms, of whom 185,000 were in combat units.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Cataclysm'' p 59&lt;/ref&gt;  However the casualties and expenditure of munitions in the Balkan Wars left Serbia depleted and dependent on France for supplies. Austria invaded twice in 1914 and was turned back. 

The 28 June 1914 [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Austrian Crown Prince [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital [[Sarajevo]], by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of [[Young Bosnia]] and one of seven assassins, served as a pretext for the Austrian declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, marking the beginning of World War I, despite Serbia's acceptance three days earlier of nearly all of [[Austria-Hungary]]'s demands . The Austro-Hungarian army invaded Serbia capturing the capial Belgrade on 2 December 1914, however the Serbian Army successfully defended the country, won several victories, and on 15 December 1914 recaptured Belgrade. 

In late 1915, however, German generals were given control and invaded Serbia with Austrian and Bulgarian forces. The Serbian army retreated across the [[Albania]]n mountain ranges to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by January 1916. Only 70,000 made it through to be evacuated to Greece by French and British naval forces.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Mitrovic, ''Serbia's Great War 1914-1918'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Serbia became an occupied land.  Disease was rampant but the Austrians were pragmatic and paid well for food supplies, so conditions were not harsh. Instead Austria tried to depoliticize Serbia, to minimize violence, and to integrate the country into the Empire.  Nevertheless Serbian nationalism remained defiant and many young men slipped out to help rebuild the Serbian army in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan E. Gumz, ''The Resurrection and Collapse of Empire in Habsburg Serbia, 1914-1918'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] promised the territories of Srem, Bačka, Baranja, eastern Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and eastern Dalmatia to Serbia as a reward after the war. Having recuperated on [[Corfu]] the Serbian Army returned to combat on the [[Thessaloniki]] front together with other [[Triple Entente|Entente]] forces. Serbia suffered 1,264,000 casualties—28% of its population of 4.6&amp;nbsp;million, which also represented 58% of its male population—a loss from which it never fully recovered.

==Royal Yugoslavia 1918–1941==
{{Main|History of Serbia after 1918|History of Yugoslavia}}

A successful Allied offensive in September 1918 secured first Bulgaria's surrender and then the liberation of the occupied Serbian territories (November 1918). On 25 November, the Assembly of [[Serbs]], [[Bunjevci]], and other nations of [[Vojvodina]] in [[Novi Sad]] voted to join the region to Serbia. Also, on 29 November the [[Podgorica Assembly|National Assembly of Montenegro]] voted for union with Serbia, and two days later an assembly of leaders of Austria–Hungary's southern Slav regions voted to join the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]].

[[File:Serbia1918.png|thumb|Short-lived borders of Serbia on 30 November 1918]]

With the end of World War I and the collapse of both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires the conditions were met for proclaiming the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in December 1918. The Yugoslav ideal had long been cultivated by the intellectual circles of the three nations that gave the name to the country, but the international constellation of political forces and interests did not permit its implementation until then. However, after the war, idealist intellectuals gave way to politicians, and the most influential Croatian politicians opposed the new state right from the start.

In the early 1920s the Yugoslav government of Serbian prime minister [[Nikola Pasic]] used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846181,00.html Balkan Politics], ''Time'', 31 March 1923&lt;/ref&gt; and other measures of [[rigged election|election rigging]] to keep the opposition, and mainly the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,719894,00.html Elections], ''Time'', 23 February 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Pasic believed that Yugoslavia should be as centralized as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a [[Greater Serbia]]n national concept of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720153,00.html The Opposition], ''Time'', 6 April 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

However, what pushed the Kingdom into crisis was when a Serb representative opened fire on the opposition benches in the Parliament, killing two outright and mortally wounding  the leader of the Croatian Peasants Party, [[Stjepan Radić]] in 1928.

Taking advantage of the resulting crisis, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] banned national political parties in 1929, assumed executive power, and renamed the country [[Yugoslavia]]. He hoped to curb separatist tendencies and mitigate nationalist passions. However, the balance of power changed in international relations: in Italy and Germany, [[Italian fascism|Fascists]] and [[Nazis]] rose to power, and [[Joseph Stalin]] became the absolute ruler in the Soviet Union. None of these three states favored the policy pursued by Alexander I. The first two wanted to revise the international treaties signed after World War I, and the Soviets were determined to regain their positions in Europe and pursue a more active international policy. Yugoslavia was an obstacle for these plans, and King Aleksandar I was the pillar of the Yugoslav policy.

During an official visit to France in 1934, the king was assassinated in [[Marseille]] by a member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] – an extreme nationalist organization in Bulgaria that had plans to annex territories along the eastern and southern Yugoslav border—with the cooperation of the [[Ustaše]] – a Croatian fascist separatist organization. The international political scene in the late 1930s was marked by growing intolerance between the principal figures, by the aggressive attitude of the totalitarian regimes. Croatian leader Vlatko Maček and his party managed to extort the creation of the Croatian banovina (administrative province) in 1939.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The agreement specified that Croatia was to remain part of Yugoslavia, but it was hurriedly building an independent political identity in international relations.

==Serbia in World War II 1941–1944==
{{Main|Occupation of Serbia in World War II|Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Banat (1941–1944)|Commissioner Government|Government of National Salvation|Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941–1944|Hungarian occupation of Bačka and Baranja, 1941–1944|Republic of Užice}}
In the run up to World War II, Prince Regent Paul signed a treaty with Hitler (as did Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary). However, a popular uprising amongst the people rejected this agreement and Prince Regent Paul was sent to exile. King Peter II assumed full royal duty.

Thus the beginning of the 1940s, Yugoslavia found itself surrounded by hostile countries. Except for Greece, all other neighboring countries had signed agreements with either Germany or Italy. [[Adolf Hitler]] was strongly pressuring Yugoslavia to join the Axis powers. The government was even prepared to reach a compromise with him, but the spirit in the country was completely different. Public demonstrations against Nazism prompted a brutal reaction.

On 6 April 1941 Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria invaded Yugoslavia, and the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombed Belgrade]] for 3 days killing 17,000 people. Belgrade was captured  by German forces on 13 April 1941, and four days later on 17 April 1941 the Royal Yugosavian Army surrendered unconditionally. Acting upon advice and with a heavy heart,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} King Peter II left the country to seek Allied support. He was greeted as the hero who dared oppose Hitler.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Royal Yugoslav Government, the only legal body of Yugoslavia, continued to work in London. The occupying Axis powers then divided Yugoslavia up. The western parts of the country together with Bosnia and Herzegovina were turned into a Nazi puppet state called the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) and ruled by the [[Ustashe]]. Most of the territory of modern Serbia was occupied by the German army and was governed by the German [[Military Administration in Serbia]]. The governed territory was called Serbia or the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]],{{#tag:ref|Official name of the occupied territory&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hehn_1971|Hehn (1971)]], pp. 344-373&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} and, besides German military administrators, it was also governed by the Serbian puppet governments first under [[Milan Aćimović]] and then under Serbian army general [[Milan Nedić]]. The northern territories were annexed by Hungary, and eastern and southern territories by Bulgaria. Kosovo and Metohija were mostly annexed by Albania which was under the sponsorship of fascist Italy. Montenegro also lost territories to Albania and was then occupied by Italian troops. [[Slovenia]] was divided between Germany and Italy, which also seized the islands in the Adriatic.

In Serbia, the German occupation authorities organized several concentration camps for Jews and members of the communist Partisan resistance movement, while Chetniks were helping fascist and nacists in their plans. 

The biggest concentration camps were [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica]] and [[Sajmište concentration camp|Sajmište]] near [[Belgrade]], where, according to the most conservative estimates, around 40,000 Jews were killed. In all those camps, some 90 percent of the Serbian Jewish population perished. In the [[Bačka]] region annexed by Hungary, numerous Serbs and Jews were killed in 1942 raid by the Hungarian authorities. The persecutions against ethnic Serb population also occurred in the region of [[Syrmia]], which was controlled by the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and in the region of [[Banat]], which was under direct German control.

The ruthless attitude of the German occupation forces and the [[genocide|genocidal]] policy of the Croatian [[Ustaša]] regime, aimed at Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-Ustaša Croats, created a strong anti-fascist resistance in the NDH.  Many Croats and other nationalities stood up against the genocide and the Nazis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Many joined the Partisan forces created by the Communist Party (National Liberation Army headed by [[Josip Broz Tito]]) in the liberation and the revolutionary war against Nazis and all the others who were against communism. 

During this war and after it, the Partisans killed many civilians who did not support their Communist ideals. The Communists shot people without trials, or following politically and ideologically motivated courts.  The Agricultural Reform conducted after the war meant that peasants had to give away most of their wheat, grain, and cattle to the state, or face serious imprisonment. Land and property were confiscated on a massive scale. Many people also lost civil rights and their names were smeared. Also, a censorship was enforced on all levels of the society and media, and a cult of Tito was created in the media.

On 20 October 1944 the Soviet Red Army liberated Belgrade and by the end of 1944 all Serbia was free from German control. Yugoslavia was among the countries that had the greatest losses in the war: 1,700,000 (10.8% of the population) people were killed and national damages were estimated at US $9.1&amp;nbsp;billion according to the prices of that period.

==Communist Yugoslavia 1945–1992==
===Tito's Rule 1945–1980===
{{Main|History of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia.svg|thumb|right|100px|Coat of arms of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], [[constituent country]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]]]]

After the war, [[Josip Broz Tito]] became the first president of the new—socialist—[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which he ruled through the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. Once a predominantly agricultural country, Yugoslavia was transformed into a mid-range industrial country, and acquired an international political reputation by supporting the [[decolonization]] process and by assuming a leading role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Socialist Yugoslavia was established as a federal state comprising six republics, from north to south: [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and two [[autonomous region]]s within Serbia – [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]]. 

The basic motto of Tito's Yugoslavia was &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot;, workers' self-management, state-owned property with minimal privately owned property. In the beginning, the country copied the Soviet model, but after the 1948 split with the Soviet Union, it turned more towards the West. Eventually, it created its own brand of socialism, with a hint of a market economy, and milked both the East and the West for significant financial loans.

The 1974 constitution produced a significantly less centralized federation, increasing the [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] of Yugoslavia's republics as well as the autonomous provinces of Serbia.

===Decline and Fall 1980–1992 ===

{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}
{{Main|Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars}}

[[File:Slobodan Milosevic.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Slobodan Milošević]].]]

When Tito died on 4 May 1980, he was succeeded by a [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|presidency]] that rotated annually between the six Republics and two Autonomous  Regions. This led to a fatal weakening of central power and ties between the republics. During the 1980s the republics pursued significantly different economic policies, with Western-oriented Slovenia and Croatia allowing significant market-based reforms, while Serbia kept to its existing program of state ownership. This, too, was a cause of tension between north and south, as Slovenia in particular experienced a period of strong growth. Prior to the war, inflation skyrocketed. Then, under Prime Minister [[Ante Markovic]], things began to improve.  Economic reforms had opened up the country, the living standard was at its peak, capitalism seemed to have entered the country and nobody thought that just a year later the first gunshots would be fired.

Within a year of Tito`s death the first cracks began to show when in the spring of 1981 when on 11 March,  26 March, and 31 March to 2 April an escalating series of increasingly large protests spread from the campus of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] to the streets of several cities in [[Kosovo]] demanding the upgrading of the Autonomous Region to the status of full Republic – these protests were violently suppressed by the Police with many deaths, and a state of emergency was declared. Serbian concerns about the treatment of Serb minorities in other republics and particularly in Kosovo were exacerbated by the [[SANU Memorandum]], drawn up by the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and published in Sep 1986 by''[[Večernje novosti]]'', which claimed that Serbs were suffering a genocide at the hands of the Kosovo Albanian majority.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=KfbI4e1q1yEC&amp;pg=PA322&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slobodan Milošević]] leader of the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] since May 1986, became the champion of the Serbian Nationalists when on 24 Apr 1987 he visited [[Kosovo Polje]] and, after local Serbs had clashed with the Police declared, 'No one has the right to beat you'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/biography/slobodan-milosevic/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slobodan Milošević]] became the most powerful politician in Serbia on 25 Sep 1987 when he defeated and humiliated his former mentor Serbian President [[Ivan Stambolic]], during the televised [[8th Session of the League of Communists of Serbia]]. Milosevic governed Serbia from his position as Chairman of the Central Committee of the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] until 8 May 1989 when he assumed the Presidency of Serbia. Milosevic supporters gained control of three other constituent parts of Yugolslavia in what became known as the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]], [[Vojvodina]] on 6 Oct 1988, [[Kosovo]] on 17 Nov 1988, and [[Montenegro]] on 11 Jan 1989.  On 25 Nov 1988 the Yugoslav National Assembly granted Serbia the right to change its constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=kosovar_self-determination_tmln_151#kosovar_self-determination_tmln_151.  Milosevic&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1989 this was done, removing autonomy from [[Vojvodina]] and Kosovo, which caused great unrest in [[Kosovo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=kosovar_self-determination_tmln_154#kosovar_self-determination_tmln_154&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1989 [[Slobodan Milošević]] made what became known as the [[Gazimestan Speech]] which was the centrepiece of a day-long event, attended by an estimated one million Serbs, to mark the 600th anniversary of the Serbian defeat at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]].  In this speech Milošević's reference to the possibility of &quot;armed battles&quot; in the future of Serbia's national development was seen by many as presaging the collapse of Yugoslavia and the bloodshed of the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

On 23 Jan 1990 at its 14th Congress the Communist League of Yugoslavia voted to remove its monopoly on political power, but the same day effectively ceased to exist as a national party when the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] walked out after [[Slobodan Milošević]] blocked all their reformist proposals. On 27 July 1990 Milošević merged the League of Communists of Serbia with several smaller communist front parties to form the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]].  A new Constitution was drawn up and came into force on 28 Sep 1990 transforming the one-party [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] into a multi-party [[Republic of Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/untc/unpan019071.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first multi-party elections were held on [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|9 and 23 December 1990]] and in what became the pattern for the next several elections the Socialist Party of Serbia won, as Milošević maintained firm control over the state media and opposition parties had little access.  On [[March 9, 1991 protest|9 March 1991]] a mass rally on the streets of [[Belgrade]] turned into a riot with vicious clashes between the protesters and police. It was organized by [[Vuk Drašković]]'s [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO). Two people died in the ensuing violence.

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up in 1991/1992 in a series of wars following the independence declarations of [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] on 25 Jun 1991, and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 5 Mar 1992. [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] left the federation peacefully on 25 Sep 1991.  The [[Yugoslav Peoples Army]](JNA) tried and failed to prevent the secession of [[Slovenia]] in the [[Ten Day War]] 26 Jun – 6 Jul 1991 and completely withdrew by 26 Oct 1991.  The JNA attempted and failed to prevent the secession of [[Croatia]] during the first phase of the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from 27 Jun 1991 until the truce of Jan 1992, but did successfully enable the Croatian Serb minority to establish the [[Republic of Serb Krajina]] which looked to Serbia for support. The biggest battle of this war was the [[Siege of Vukovar]]. Following the start of the [[Bosnian War]] on 1 April 1992 the JNA officially withdrew all its forces from Croatia and Bosnia in May 1992 and was formally dissolved on 20 May 1992 – its remnant forces being taken over by the new [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

==Rump Yugoslavia 1992–2003==
The two remaining republics of Yugoslavia, [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]]  and [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]], formed on 28 April 1992 a new federation named [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

===The Milošević Years 1992–2000===
{{see also|1996–1997 protests in Serbia|1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia}}

[[File:Student protest 96.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Student [[1996–1997 protests in Serbia|protests]] against Milosevic.]]

Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the ''[[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]'' (FRY) was established in 1992 as a federation. In 2003, it was reconstituted as a [[political union]] called the ''[[State Union]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'' (SCG).

After June 1999, [[Kosovo]] was made a United Nations [[protectorate]], under the [[UN Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) based in [[Priština]]. From early 2001, UNMIK has been working with representatives of the Serbian and union governments to reestablish stable relations in the region. A new assembly of the province was elected in November 2001, which formed a government and chose a president in February 2002. In spring 2002, UNMIK announced its plan to repatriate ethnic Serb [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs).

Although threatened by Milošević throughout the last years of his rule, Montenegro's democratization efforts have continued. In January 1998, [[Milo Đukanović]] became Montenegro's president, following bitterly contested elections in November 1997, which were declared free and fair by international monitors. His coalition followed up with parliamentary elections in May. Having weathered Milošević's campaign to undermine his government, Đukanović has struggled to balance the pro-independence stance of his coalition with the changed domestic and international environment of the post-5 October Balkans. In December 2002, Đukanović resigned as president and was appointed Prime Minister. The new President of Montenegro is [[Filip Vujanović]].

[[Image:Balkans05.png|thumb|left|Central Balkans including FR Yugoslavia and Serbia in 1998]]
Before 5 October, even as opposition grew, Milošević continued to dominate the organs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Government. And although his political party, the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS) (in electoral cartel with [[Mirjana Markovic]]' [[Yugoslav United Left]]), did not enjoy a majority in either the federal or Serbian parliaments, it dominated the governing coalitions and held all the key administrative posts. An essential element of Milošević's grasp on power was his control of the Serbian police, a heavily armed force of some 100,000 that was responsible for internal security and which committed serious human rights abuses. Routine federal elections in September 2000 resulted in [[Vojislav Koštunica|Kostunica]] receiving less than a majority, requiring a second round. Immediately, street protests and rallies filled cities across the country as Serbs rallied around [[Vojislav Koštunica]], the recently formed [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS, a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties) candidate for FRY president. There had been widespread fear that the second round would be cancelled on the basis of foreign interference in the elections.  Cries of fraud and calls for Milošević's removal echoed across city squares from [[Subotica]] to [[Niš]].

{{main|Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Otpor!}}

On 5 October 2000, Slobodan Milošević was forced to concede defeat after days of mass protests all across Serbia.

===Democratic Serbia 2000–2003===
The new FRY President [[Vojislav Koštunica]] was soon joined at the top of the domestic Serbian political scene by the Democratic Party's (DS) [[Zoran Đinđić]], who was elected Prime Minister of Serbia at the head of the DOS ticket in December's republican elections. After an initial honeymoon period in the wake of 5 October, DSS and the rest of DOS, led by Đinđić and his DS, found themselves increasingly at odds over the nature and pace of the governments' reform programs. Although initial reform efforts were highly successful, especially in the economic and fiscal sectors, by the middle of 2002, the nationalist Koštunica and the pragmatic Đinđić were openly at odds. Koštunica's party, having informally withdrawn from all DOS decision-making bodies, was agitating for early elections to the Serbian Parliament in an effort to force Đinđić from the scene. After the initial euphoria of replacing Milošević's autocratic regime, the Serbian population, in reaction to this political maneuvering, was sliding into apathy and disillusionment with its leading politicians by mid-2002. This political stalemate continued for much of 2002, and reform initiatives stalled.

==Serbia &amp; Montenegro 2003–2006==

In February 2003, the Constitutional Charter was finally ratified by both republics, and the FRY Parliament and the name of the country was changed from Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro. Under the new Constitutional Charter, most federal functions and authorities devolved to the republic level. The office of President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, held by Vojislav Koštunica, ceased to exist once [[Svetozar Marović]] was elected President of Serbia and Montenegro.

On 12 March 2003, Serbian Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]] was assassinated. The newly formed union government of Serbia and Montenegro reacted swiftly by calling a state of emergency and undertaking an unprecedented crackdown on organized crime which led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people.

{{main|Serbian parliamentary election, 2003}}

Parliamentary elections were held in the [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Republic of Serbia]] on 28 December 2003. 
Serbia had been in a state of political crisis since the overthrow of the [[post-communist]] ruler, [[Slobodan Milošević]], in 2001. The reformers, led by former Yugoslav President [[Vojislav Koštunica]], have been unable to gain control of the Serbian presidency because three successive presidential elections have failed to produce the required 50% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/serbia/serbiaindex.html see details here]&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination in March 2003 of the reforming Prime Minister, [[Zoran Đinđić]] was a major setback.

Despite the great increase in support for the Radicals, the four pro-reform parties (Koštunica's [[Democratic Party of Serbia]], late Prime Minister Đinđić's [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]], now led by [[Boris Tadić]], and the [[G17 Plus]] group of liberal economists led by [[Miroljub Labus]], plus the SPO-NS) won 49.8% of the vote, compared with 34.8% for the two anti-western parties, the [[Serbian Radical Party|Radicals]] of [[Vojislav Šešelj]] and the [[Socialist Party of Serbia|Socialists]] of Milošević, and won 146 seats to 104. 

At the [[Serbian presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]] [[Boris Tadić]], candidate of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] won over [[Tomislav Nikolić]], of the [[Serbian Radical Party]], sealing the future reform and EU-integration path of Serbia. Tadic's presidency was [[Serbian presidential election, 2008|confirmed in 2008]]

==Independent Serbia  2006–present day==
[[Image:Balkans2010.png|thumb|left|Serbia and Central Balkans in 2010 (de facto situation). Serbia does not recognize the self-proclaimed independence of Kosovo]]
Since 1996, [[Montenegro]] began to sever economic ties with [[Serbia]] as it formed a new [[economic policy]] and adopted the [[Deutsche Mark]] as its currency. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in [[Belgrade]]. Also, separatist Albanian paramilitaries began a steady escalation of violence in 1998. The question whether the Federal Yugoslav state would continue to exist became a very serious issue to the government.

Following Montenegro's vote for full independence in the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]] of 21 May 2006 (55.4% yes, 44.6% no),&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2006/May |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2006/05/mil-060522-rferl03.htm|title = Montenegro: Independence Referendum Turns Into Cliffhanger |publisher=globalsecurity.org| accessdate = 2008-03-04 | last=Charles Recknagel |quote=&quot;For independence of Montenegro, 55.4 percent of citizens have voted. 44.6 percent of citizens have voted for the union state&quot;, Frantisek Lipka, a Slovak diplomat heading the referendum commission, announced at a news conference in Podgorica today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date= 26 September 2007&lt;!--, 14:53 GMT 15:53 UK--&gt;|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/5075632.stm|title = Timeline: Montenegro|publisher=BBC News  | accessdate = 2008-03-04 |quote=2006  June – Montenegro declared independence, Serbia responded by declaring itself the independent sovereign successor state to the Union of Serbia and Montenegro.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed on 5 June 2006 by Serbia's declaration of independence, marking the final dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and the re-emergence of Serbia as an independent state, under its own name, for the first time since 1918.

[[File:Flag of Serbia.svg|thumb|right|200px|Flag of post-2006 independent Serbia]]

A [[Serbian constitutional referendum, 2006|referendum]] was held on 28 and 29 October 2006 on a proposed draft of the new [[Constitution of Serbia]], which was approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6097344.stm |publisher=BBC   |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30 |title=Serbia backs draft constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is Serbia's first as an independent state since the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]'s 1903 constitution. 

The [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 elections]] confirmed the pro-reform and pro-European stance of the Serbian Parliament, in which [[Boris Tadic]]'s party doubled his representation. 

A [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2008|pre-term parliamentary election was held on 11 May 2008]], barely a year after the previous one. 
The [[Government of Serbia|Serbian government]] had passed through weeks of severe crisis after the [[unilateral declaration of independence]] of its southern province of [[Kosovo]] on 17 February 2008, which was gradually recognized by the United States and numerous [[European Union]] countries.
The crisis was fuelled by the demand by Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] of the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] (DSS) to the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)]] (DS), which held governmental majority, of a restructuring of the governmental contract including an annex according to which Serbia can continue European integration exclusively with Kosovo as its integral part, as stated in the [[Constitution of Serbia|2006 Constitution]]. The [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|DS]] and [[G17+]] refused, and Koštunica had to resign on 8 March 2008, while also asking the President to dismiss the parliament and schedule pre-term parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=11&amp;nav_id=48356 B92 – News – Politics – Tadić to dissolve parliament on 13 March&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The results showed a net increase of votes for Tadic's ZES coalition, passing from 87 to 102 seats.
After long and difficult negotiations, a new pro-European government was formed on 7 July 2008 by 128 out of 250 parliamentary votes of ZES, SPS-PUPS-JS and 6 out of 7 minorities representatives. The new [[prime Minister of Serbia|prime minister]] was [[Mirko Cvetković]], candidate of the Democratic Party.

===Kosovo dispute===
{{main|Political status of Kosovo|Kosovo status process}}
On 17 February 2008, the [[Kosovo]] parliament unilaterally [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|proclaimed independence]] from Serbia to mixed international reactions. The declaration was officially recognized by the U.S., Austria, Great Britain, Germany, France, Turkey and dozen other countries. Serbia, Russia, China, Spain, India, Brazil, Greece, Romania and other countries oppose this declaration and consider it illegal. In July 2010, the United Nations International Court of Justice deemed the separation of Kosovo legal, and Kosovo officials plan a 2011 application to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/93190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/07/25/nb-04&lt;/ref&gt;

===EU integration===
{{main|Accession of Serbia to the European Union}}

Serbia officially applied for [[European Union]] membership on 22 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.se2009.eu/en/meetings_news/2009/12/22/serbia_applies_for_eu_membership|title=Serbia applies for EU membership|publisher=Swedish Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=25 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite its setbacks in the political field, on 7 December 2009 the EU unfroze the trade agreement with Serbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/news/791/eu_unfreezes_trade_agreement_with_serbia|title=EU unfreezes trade agreement with Serbia|accessdate=25 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schengen countries dropped the visa requirement for Serbian citizens on 19 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8387938.stm|title=EU scraps visas for three Balkan states|publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 December 2009 | date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stabilisation and Association Agreement]] (SAA) was signed in 2008 and is expected to enter into force in 2011.
