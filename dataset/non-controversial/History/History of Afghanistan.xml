==Prehistory==
{{Main|Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Indo-Iranian origins.png|thumb|Archaeological cultures associated with [[Indo-Iranian migration]]s (after [[EIEC]]). The Andronovo, [[BMAC]] and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with [[Indo-Aryan migration]]s.]]
Excavations of prehistoric sites by [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]] and others suggest that early humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in Afghanistan were among the earliest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shroder&quot;/&gt; {{quote|[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have found evidence of human habitation in Afghanistan from as far back as 50,000 BC. The artifacts indicate that the [[indigenous people]] were small farmers and herdsmen, very probably grouped into tribes, with small local kingdoms rising and falling through the ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal-history&quot;/&gt;}}

Urbanization may have begun as early as 3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Craig (1995) &quot;Historical Setting&quot; pp. 90–120, page 91, ''In'' Gladstone, Cary (2001) ''Afghanistan revisited'' Nova Science Publications, New York, ISBN 1-59033-421-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroastrianism]] predominated as the religion in the area, even the modern Afghan solar calendar shows the influence of Zoroastrianism in the names of the months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal-history&quot;/&gt; Other religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] arrived later to the region. [[Gandhara]] is the name of an ancient Hindu kingdom from the Vedic period and its capital city located between the [[Hindukush]] and [[Sulaiman Mountains]] (mountains of [[Solomon]]),&lt;ref&gt;Gandara...[http://www.livius.org/ga-gh/gandara/gandara.html Link]&lt;/ref&gt; although Kandahar in modern times and the ancient Gandhara are not geographically identical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem Vogelsang|W. Vogelsang]], ''&quot;Gandahar&quot;'', in ''The Circle Of Ancient Iranian Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Herzfeld, ''&quot;The Persian Empire: Studies on Geography and Ethnography of the Ancient Near East&quot;'', ed. G. Walser, [[Wiesbaden]] 1968, pp. 279, 293–94, 336–38, 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Early inhabitants, around 3000 BC were likely to have been connected through culture and trade to neighboring civilizations like [[Jiroft]] and [[Tappeh Sialk]] and more distantly to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BC, and it is possible that the early city of Mundigak (near [[Kandahar]]) was a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree&quot;/&gt; The first known people were [[Indo-Iranians]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Shroder&quot;/&gt; but their date of arrival has been estimated widely from as early as about 3000 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Mallory&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mallory |first=J.

===Bactria-Margiana===
{{Main|Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex}}
The [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]] became prominent in the southwest region between 2200 and 1700 BC (approximately). The city of [[Balkh]] ([[Bactra]]) was founded about this time (c. 2000–1500 BC). It's possible that the [[BMAC]] may have been an [[Indo-European]] culture, perhaps the Proto-[[Indo-Aryans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mallory&quot;/&gt; But the standard model holds the arrival of Indo-Aryans to have been in the [[Late Harappan]] which gave rise to the [[Vedic civilization]] of the [[Early Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Parpola |given=Asko |authorlink=Asko Parpola |year=1998 |chapter=Aryan Languages, Archaeological Cultures, and Sinkiang: Where Did Proto-Iranian Come into Being and How Did It Spread? |editor=Mair |title=The Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Peoples of Eastern and Central Asia |publisher=Institute for the Study of Man |place=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-941694-63-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medes===
{{Further|Medes}}
Different opinions have been expressed about the extent of the [[Median kingdom]]. For instance, according to [[Ernst Herzfeld]], it was a powerful empire, which stretched from north [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Bactria]] and [[India]]. On the other side, [[Heleen Sancisi-Weerdenburg]] insists that there is no real evidence about the very existence of the Median empire and that it was an unstable state formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/media | title=MEDIA | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=M.

===Achaemenid Empire===
{{Main|Achaemenid Empire}}
[[File:Afghanistan region during 500 BC.jpg|thumb|[[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] and [[Bactria]] were the ancient [[satrap]]s of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] that made up most of what is now Afghanistan during 500 B.C. Some of the inhabitants of Arachosia were known as ''Pactyans'', whose name possibly survives in today's [[Pashtun people|Pakhtuns]] (Pashtuns).]]
Afghanistan became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], after it was conquered by [[Darius I of Persia]]. The area was divided into several provinces called [[satrapy|satrapies]], which were each ruled by a governor, or [[satrap]]. These ancient satrapies included: [[Aria]] ([[Herat]]); [[Arachosia]] ([[Kandahar]], [[Lashkar Gah]], and [[Quetta]]); [[Bactria]]na ([[Balkh]]); [[Sattagydia]] ([[Ghazni]]); and [[Gandhara]] ([[Kabul]], [[Jalalabad]], [[Peshawar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dupree (professor)|Dupree, Louis]]: ''Afghanistan (1973)'', pg. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander and the Seleucids===
{{Main|Wars of Alexander the Great}}
[[Alexander the Great]] arrived in the area of Afghanistan in 330 BC after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Achaemenid&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0003) |title=Achaemenid Rule, ca. 550-331 B.C. |accessdate=2010-08-16 |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan |location=United States|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; His army faced very strong resistance in the Afghan tribal areas where he is said to have commented that Afghanistan is &quot;easy to march into, hard to march out of.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal-history&quot;/&gt; Although his expedition through Afghanistan was brief, Alexander left behind a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] cultural influence that lasted several centuries. Several great cities were built in the region named &quot;Alexandria,&quot; including: Alexandria-of-the-Arians (modern-day [[Herat]]); Alexandria-on-the-[[Tarnak River|Tarnak]] (near [[Kandahar]]); Alexandria-ad-Caucasum (near [[Begram]], at Bordj-i-Abdullah); and finally, Alexandria-Eschate (near Kojend), in the north. After Alexander's death, his loosely connected empire was divided. [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] officer during Alexander's campaign, declared himself ruler of his own Seleucid Empire, encompassing Persia and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Dupree, Louis: ''Afghanistan (1973)'', pp. 276-283&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Bactrian Kingdom===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:Greco-BactrianKingdomMap.jpg|thumb|Approximate maximum extent of the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] circa 180 BC, including the regions of [[Tapuria]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Traxiane]] to the West, [[Sogdiana]] and [[Ferghana]] to the north, [[Bactria]] and [[Arachosia]] to the south.]]
The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was founded when [[Diodotus I]], the [[satrap]] of Bactria (and probably the surrounding provinces) seceded from the Seleucid Empire around 250 BC. Greco-Bactria continued until c. 130 BC, when Eucratides' son, King Heliocles I, was defeated and driven out of Bactria by the Yuezhi tribes. It is thought that his dynasty continued to rule in [[Kabul]] and [[Alexandria of the Caucasus]] until 70 BC when [[King Hermaeus]] was defeated by the Yuezhi.

One of Demetrius' successors, [[Menander I]], brought the Indo-Greek Kingdom to its height between 165–130 BC, expanding the kingdom in India to even larger proportions than Demetrius. After Menander's death, the Indo-Greeks steadily declined and the last Indo-Greek king was defeated in c. 10 CE.

=== Mauryan Empire ===
{{Main|Mauryan Empire}}
Modern day Afghanistan was conquered by the [[Maurya Empire]], which was led by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] from [[Magadha]] (modern day [[Bihar]] in India). They were Indians who practiced [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] and were focusing on taking over Central Asia. Seleucus is said to have reach a [[peace treaty]] with Chandragupta by given control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.

Sandrocottus, having thus acquired a throne, was in possession of India, when Seleucus was laying the foundations of his future greatness; who, after making a league with him, and settling his affairs in the east, proceeded to join in the war against Antigonus. As soon as the forces, therefore, of all the confederates were united, a battle was fought, in which Antigonus was slain, and his son Demetrius put to flight.&lt;ref&gt;Historiarum Philippicarum libri XLIV, [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans15.html XV.4.19]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Justin (historian)|Junianus Justinus]]}}

Having consolidated power in the northwest, Chandragupta pushed east towards the Nanda Empire. Afghanistan's significant  ancient tangible and intangible [[Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan|Buddhist heritage]] is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds, including religious and artistic remnants. Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as [[Balkh]] even during the life of the [[Buddha]] (563 BC to 483 BC), as recorded by [[Xuanzang|Husang Tsang]].{{quote|In this context a legend recorded by Husang Tsang refers to the first two lay disciples of Buddha, Trapusa and [[Bahlikas|Bhallika]] responsible for introducing [[Buddhism]] in that country. Originally these two were merchants of the kingdom of Balhika, as the name Bhalluka or Bhallika probably suggests the association of one with that country. They had gone to India for trade and had happened to be at [[Bodhgaya]] when the [[Buddha]] had just attained enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism in central Asia|last1=Puri|first1=Baij Nath|authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=1987|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|location=|isbn=81-208-0372-8|page=90|page=352|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sluKZfTrr3oC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Hephthalite Empire in Afghanistan extended from Chinese [[Sinkiang]] to Sassanid Iran, from [[Sogdiana]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Their chief antagonists were the Sassanids. Consequently there was relatively little peace during this time. At about 565 AD, the Hephthalite Empire was overthrown by a combined force consisting of western [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and Sassanids.&lt;ref&gt;Dupree, Louis: ''Afghanistan'' (1973), pg. 302-303&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pāla's were a [[Buddhist]] and [[Vaishnav| Vaishnav Hindu]] [[Bengal]]i dynasty of India, which lasted for four centuries (750-1120&amp;nbsp;AD). Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. This triggered once again the power struggle for the control of the subcontinent. [[Devapala]], successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond. His empire stretched from [[Assam]] and [[Utkala]] in the east, and modern day [[Afghanistan]] in the north-west and [[Deccan]] in the south. According to Pala copperplate inscription Devapala exterminated the Utkalas, conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the [[Huna people|Huna]], and humbled the lords of [[Pratihara]]s, [[Gurjara]] and the [[Dravida]]s. The Pala Empire eventually disintegrated in the 12th century under the attack of the [[Sena dynasty]].

===Islamic conquest===
{{Main|Islamic conquest of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|The Afghan area during the [[Caliphate]]]]
In 642 CE, Arabs had conquered most of Persia and from the western city of [[Herat]] introduced the religion of Islam as they entered new cities. Afghanistan at that period had a number of different independent rulers, depending on the area.

The early Arab forces did not fully explore Afghanistan due to attacks by the mountain tribes. Much of the eastern parts of the country remained independent, as part of the Turk Shahi kingdoms of Kabul and [[Gandhara]], which lasted that way until the forces of the Muslim [[Saffarid dynasty]] followed by the [[Ghaznavids]] conquered them.{{quote|''Arab armies carrying the banner of Islam came out of the west to defeat the [[Sasanians]] in [[642|642 CE]] and then they marched with confidence to the east. On the western periphery of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] area the princes of [[Herat]] and [[Seistan]] gave way to rule by Arab governors but in the east, in the mountains, cities submitted only to rise in revolt and the hastily converted returned to their old beliefs once the armies passed. The harshness and avariciousness of Arab rule produced such unrest, however, that once the waning power of the [[Caliphate]] became apparent, native rulers once again established themselves independent. Among these the [[Saffarids]] of Seistan shone briefly in the Afghan area. The fanatic founder of this dynasty, the Pashtun tribe [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari|Yaqub ibn Layth Saffari]], came forth from his capital at [[Zaranj]] in 870 CE and marched through [[Bost]], [[Kandahar]], [[Ghazni]], [[Kabul]], [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]], [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]], conquering in the name of Islam. As Saffari's are known one of the most powerful warriors and they are the one who are blessed by the title of Pathans (the Pashtun tribes) by the arab muslims. As some of the arabs and afghan still believe that in India (specially from the part of U.P) the warlords from Saffari Dynasty are still alive.

The Shahi or Shahiya dynasties ruled portions of the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] (in eastern Afghanistan) and the old province of Gandhara (northern Pakistan and [[Kashmir]]) from the decline of the [[Kushan Empire]] up to the early 9th century. The Shahis continued to rule eastern Afghanistan until the late 9th century until the [[Ghaznavid]] invasions.
{{quote|During the eighth and ninth centuries CE the eastern parts of modern Afghanistan were still in the hands of non-muslim rulers.

The Ghaznavid dynasty was defeated in 1148 by the [[Ghurids]] from [[Ghor]], but the Ghaznavid [[Sultan]]s continued to live in Ghazni as the '[[Nasher (tribe)|Nasher]]' until the early 20th century. They did not regain their once vast power until about 500 years later when the [[Ghilzai]] [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotakis]] rose to power. Various princes and [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] rulers attempted to rule parts of the country until the [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Muhammad II]] of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] conquered all of Persia in 1205. By 1219, the empire had fallen to the [[Mongols]], led by [[Genghis Khan]].

The Mongols resulted in massive destruction of many cities, including [[Bamiyan]], [[Herat]], and [[Balkh]], and the despoliation of fertile agricultural areas. Large number of the inhabitant were also slaughtered. All the major cities and towns became part of the massive [[Mongol Empire]],

===Timurids===
{{Main|Timurid dynasty}}
[[Timur]] ([[Tamerlane]]), incorporated what is today Afghanistan into his own vast [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]]. The city of Herat became one of the capitals of his empire, and his grandson [[Pir Muhammad]] held the seat of [[Kandahar]]. Timur rebuilt most of Afghanistan's infrastructure which was destroyed by his early ancestor. The area was progressing under his rule. Timurid rule began declining in the early 16th century with the rise of a new ruler in Kabul, [[Babur]].
Taimur, a descendent of Genghis Khan, created a vast new empire across Russia and Persia which he ruled from his capital in Samarkland in modern day Uzbekistan. Taimur captured Herat in 1381 and his son, Shah Rudkh moved the capital of the Timurid empire to Herat in 1405. The Timurks, a Turkic people, brought the Turkic nomadic culture of Central Asia within the orbit of Persian civilisation, establishing Herat on of the most cultured and refined cities in the world. This fusion of Central Asian and Persian culture was a major legacy for the future Afghanistan. A century later, the emperor Babur, a descendent of Taimur, visited Herat and wrote, &quot;the whole habitable world had not such a town as Herat.&quot; For the next 300 years the eastern Afghan tribes periodically invaded India creating vast Indo-Afghan empires. In 1500 Taimur's descendent, Babur was driven out of his home in the Ferghana valley. By the 16th century western Afghanistan again revereted to Persian rule under the Safavid dynasty.

In 1504 [[Babur]], a descendant of Timur, arrived from what is now Uzbekistan and to the city of Kabul. He began exploring new territories in the region, with Kabul serving as his military headquarters. Instead of looking towards Persia, Babur was more focused on the [[Indian subcontinent]], which included the region known as [[Kabulistan]]. In 1526, he left with his army to capture the seat of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], which at that point was possessed by the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]] of India. After defeating [[Ibrahim Lodi]] and his army, Babur turned Delhi into the capital of his newly established [[Mughal Empire]].

From the 16th century to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was divided in to three major areas. The north was ruled by the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], the west was under the rule of the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]]s, and the east belonged to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Mughals of India. The Kandahar region in the south served as a [[buffer zone]] between the powerful Mughals and Safavids, and the native Afghans often switched support from one side to the other. Babur explored most cities of Afghanistan before his campaign into India. In the city of Kandahar his personal epigraphy can be found in the Chilzina rock mountain.

In 1704, the Safavid Shah [[Sultan Husayn|Husayn]] appointed [[George XI of Kartli|George XI]] (''Gurgīn Khān''), a ruthless [[Georgians|Georgian]], to govern the Greater Kandahar region of Afghanistan. Gurgīn began imprisoning and executing many of the native Afghans, especially those suspected of organizing a [[rebellion]]. One of those arrested and imprisoned was [[Mirwais Hotak]] who belonged to an influential family in [[Kandahar]]. Mirwais was sent as a prisoner to the Persian court in [[Isfahan]] but the charges against him were dismissed by the king, so he was sent back to his native land as a free man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otfinoski&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven Bruce|authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=|isbn=0-8160-5056-2|page=8|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fbXmk-EauHIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmud began a reign of terror against his Persian subjects and was eventually murdered in 1725 by his cousin, [[Ashraf Hotaki]]. Some sources say he died of madness.

Ashraf was able to secure peace with the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1727, but the [[Russian Empire]] took advantage of the political unrest in Persia to seize land for themselves, limiting the amount of territory under Shah Mahmud's control.

The Hotaki dynasty was a troubled and violent one as internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control.

Nadir Shah was assassinated on June 19, 1747, by several of his Persian officers, and the Asharid kingdom fell to pieces. While the Persians were contesting each other in Iran, the 25-year-old Ahmad Khan was busy in Afghanistan calling for a [[loya jirga]] (&quot;grand assembly&quot;) to select a leader among his people. The Afghans gathered near Kandahar in October 1747 and chose Ahmad Shah among the challengers, making him their new [[head of state]]. After the inauguration or [[coronation]], he became known as [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]. He adopted the title ''padshah durr-i dawran'' ('King, &quot;pearl of the age&quot;) and the Abdali tribe became known as the [[Durrani]] tribe after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10162/Ahmad-Shah-Durrani|title=Aḥmad Shah Durrānī|acces.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan|accessdate=2010-08-16 |work=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)|publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Shah not only represented the Durranis but he also united all the [[Pashtun tribes]].

In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in Kandahar where he died peacefully and was buried at a site that is now adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Cloak]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Timur Shah Durrani]], who transferred the capital of their [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]] from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]] took over the reign.

Zaman Shah and his brothers had a weak hold on the legacy left to them by their famous ancestor. They sorted out their differences through a &quot;round robin of expulsions, blindings and executions,&quot; which resulted in the deterioration of the Afghan hold over far-flung territories, such as [[Attock]] and [[Kashmir]]. Durrani's other grandson, [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], fled the wrath of his brother and sought refuge with the Sikhs. Not only had Durrani invaded the Punjab region many times, but had destroyed the holiest shrine of the Sikhs – the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]], defiling its ''sarowar'' with the blood of cows and decapitating [[Baba Deep Singh]] in 1757. The Sikhs, under [[Ranjit Singh]], eventually wrested a large part of the [[Durrani Empire|Kingdom of Kabul]] (present day Pakistan, but not including [[Sindh]]) from the Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;Nalwa, V.

===Barakzai dynasty and British influence===

[[File:Mohammad Yaqub Khan with British officers in May of 1879.jpg|thumb|[[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|King]] [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Khan]] with Britain's Sir [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari]] on May 26, 1879, when the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was signed.]]
[[Dost Mohammed Khan]] gained control in Kabul. Collision between the expanding [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire]]s significantly influenced Afghanistan during the 19th century in what was termed &quot;[[The Great Game]]&quot;. British concern over Russian advances in [[Central Asia]] and growing influence in Persia culminated in two Anglo-Afghan wars and &quot;The Siege of Herat&quot; 1837–1838, in which the Persians, trying to retake Afghanistan and throw out the British and Russians, sent armies into the country and fought the British mostly around and in the city of [[Herat]]. The [[first Anglo-Afghan War]] (1839–1842) resulted in the destruction of a British army; it is remembered as an example of the ferocity of Afghan resistance to foreign rule. The [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] (1878–1880) was sparked by Amir [[Shir Ali Khan of Afghanistan|Shir Ali]]'s refusal to accept a British mission in Kabul. This conflict brought [[Amir Abdur Rahman]], known by some as the &quot;Iron Amir&quot;,  to the Afghan throne. During his reign (1880–1901), the British and Russians officially established the boundaries of what would become modern Afghanistan. The British retained effective control over [[Kabul]]'s foreign affairs. Abdur Rahman's reforms of the army, legal system and structure of government were able to give Afghanistan a degree of unity and stability which it had not before known. This, however, came at the cost of strong centralisation, harsh punishments for crime and corruption, and a certain degree of international isolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bijanomrani.com&quot;/&gt;

Afghanistan remained neutral during World War I, despite German encouragement of anti-British feelings and Afghan rebellion along the borders of [[British Raj|British India]]. The Afghan king's policy of neutrality was not universally popular within the country, however.

[[Habibullah Khan|Habibullah]], Abdur Rahman's son and successor, was assassinated in 1919, possibly by family members opposed to British influence. His third son, [[Amanullah Khan|Amanullah]], regained control of Afghanistan's foreign policy after launching the [[Third Anglo-Afghan war]] with an attack on India in the same year. During the ensuing conflict, the war-weary British relinquished their control over Afghan foreign affairs by signing the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]] in August 1919. In commemoration of this event, Afghans celebrate August 19 as their Independence Day.

===Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war===
{{Main|Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war}}
[[File:King Amanullah Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[King]] [[Amanullah Khan]]]]
King [[Amanullah Khan]] moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]] (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by [[Atatürk]]), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], Amanullah Khan's Foreign Minister and father-in-law&amp;nbsp;— and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a [[Loya Jirga]]), which made elementary education compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/people/Shorish-Education_in_Afghanistan.htm Education in Afghanistan]&quot;, published in ''Encyclopaedia Iranica, volume VIII'' – pp. 237–241&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[Muslim]] [[veil]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after [[Kabul]] fell to forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]].

===Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah===

{{Main|Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah}}
[[File:King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1963.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Mohammad Zahir Shah]] in 1963]]
Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Khan]], cousin of Amanullah Khan, in turn defeated and executed Habibullah Kalakani in early November 1929. He was soon declared King Nadir Khan. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a student from Kabul.

[[Mohammad Zahir Shah]], Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle [[Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan]], who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union and a more distant one towards Pakistan.  However, disputes with Pakistan led to an economic crisis and he was asked to resign in 1963. From 1963 until 1973, Zahir Shah took a more active role.

In 1964, King Zahir Shah promulgated a liberal constitution providing for a bicameral legislature to which the king appointed one-third of the deputies. The people elected another third, and the remainder were selected indirectly by provincial assemblies. Although Zahir's &quot;experiment in democracy&quot; produced few lasting reforms, it permitted the growth of unofficial extremist parties on both the left and the right. These included the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), which had close ideological ties to the Soviet Union. In 1967, the PDPA split into two major rival factions: the [[Khalq]] (Masses) was headed by [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and [[Hafizullah Amin]] who were supported by elements within the military, and the [[Parcham]] (Banner) led by [[Babrak Karmal]].

==Contemporary era (1973–present)==

===Republic of Afghanistan and the end of monarchy===
{{Main|Republic of Afghanistan}}
Amid charges of corruption and malfeasance against the royal family and poor economic conditions created by the severe 1971–72 drought, former Prime Minister [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Mohammad Sardar Daoud Khan]] seized power in a non-violent coup on July 17, 1973, while Zahir Shah was receiving treatment for eye problems and therapy for lumbago in Italy.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;Barry Bearak, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/world/asia/23cnd-shah.html Former King of Afghanistan Dies at 92], ''The New York Times'', July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Daoud abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution, and declared Afghanistan a republic with himself as its first President and Prime Minister. His attempts to carry out badly needed economic and social reforms met with little success, and the new constitution promulgated in February 1977 failed to quell chronic political instability.

As disillusionment set in, in 1978 a prominent member of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), [[Mir Akbar Khyber]] (or &quot;Kaibar&quot;), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after. Nonetheless, [[Hafizullah Amin]] and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA's [[Khalq]] faction managed to remain at large and organize a military coup.

===Democratic Republic and Soviet war===

[[File:Day after Saur revolution.JPG|thumb|The day after the Marxist revolution on April 28, 1978.]]

On 27 April 1978, the PDPA, led by [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]], Babrak Karmal and Amin Taha overthrew the government of Mohammad Daoud, who was [[assassinated]] along with all his family members in a bloody military coup. The coup became known as the [[Saur Revolution]]. On 1 May, Taraki became [[President]], [[Prime Minister]] and [[General Secretary]] of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.

In March 1979, [[Hafizullah Amin]] took over as prime minister, retaining the position of [[field marshal]] and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On 14 September, Amin overthrew Taraki, who was killed. Amin stated that &quot;the Afghans recognize only crude force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=352| publisher = I.B.

Once in power, the PDPA implemented a liberal and Marxist-Leninist agenda. It moved to replace religious and traditional laws with secular and Marxist-Leninist ones. Men were obliged to cut their beards, women could not wear a [[chador]], and mosques were placed off limits. The PDPA made a number of reforms on [[women's rights]], banning forced marriages, giving state recognition of women's right to vote, and introducing women to political life. A prominent example was [[Anahita Ratebzad]], who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous ''New Kabul Times'' editorial (May 28, 1978) which declared: &quot;Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country ... Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention.&quot; The PDPA also carried out socialist [[land reform]]s. It moved to promote [[state atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfw.org/resources/levelxmagazine/0203_Soviet-Afghan%20War.pdf The Soviet-Afghan War:Breaking the Hammer &amp; Sickle]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried out an ill-conceived [[land reform]], which was misunderstood by virtually all Afghans. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} They also prohibited [[usury]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took a number of measures in favor of [[women's rights]], by declaring equality of the sexes&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and introducing women to political life. 
The PDPA invited the Soviet Union to assist in modernizing its economic infrastructure (predominantly its exploration and mining of rare minerals and natural gas). The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also sent contractors to build roads, hospitals and schools and to drill water wells; they also trained and equipped the Afghan army. Upon the PDPA's ascension to power, and the establishment of the DRA, the Soviet Union promised monetary aid amounting to at least $1.262 billion.

At the same time, the PDPA imprisoned, tortured or murdered thousands of members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment, and the intelligentsia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofnations.net/asia/afghanistan.html |title=History of Afghanistan |publisher=Historyofnations.net |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch estimates that as many as 100,000 people may have been killed in the countryside alone by government troops{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Members of the academia and ethnic minorities{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} were killed, tortured or imprisoned. In December 1978 the PDPA leadership signed an agreement with the Soviet Union which would allow military support for the PDPA in Afghanistan if needed. The majority of people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the Marxist-Leninist and secular nature of the government as well as its heavy dependence on the Soviet Union made it unpopular with a majority of the Afghan population. Repressions plunged large parts of the country, especially the rural areas, into open revolt against the new Marxist-Leninist government. By spring 1979 unrests had reached 24 out of 28 Afghan provinces including major urban areas. Over half of the Afghan army would either desert or join the insurrection. Most of the government's new policies clashed directly with the traditional [[Islam in Afghanistan|Afghan understanding of Islam]], making religion one of the only forces capable of unifying the tribally and ethnically divided population against the unpopular new government, and ushering in the advent of [[Islamist]] participation in Afghan politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/afghanistan |title=Afghanistan |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Iranian Revolution]], the US sought rapprochement with the Afghan government—a prospect that the USSR found unacceptable due to weakening Soviet leverage over the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Michael, &quot;Who is Responsible for the Taliban?&quot;, Middle East Review of International Affairs, Vol. 6, No. 1 (March 2002). http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/mrubin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Cyrus Vance]]'s close aide Marshall Shulman  &quot;the State Department worked hard to dissuade the Soviets from invading.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenation.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Alterman |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/blowback-prequel |title='Blowback,' the Prequel |publisher=The Nation |date=October 25, 2001 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1979, U.S. Ambassador [[Adolph Dubs|Adolph &quot;Spike&quot; Dubs]] was murdered in Kabul after Afghan security forces burst in on his kidnappers.  The U.S. then reduced bilateral assistance and terminated a small military training program.  All remaining assistance agreements were ended after the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].  Following the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. In addition, generous U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist [[Afghan refugees]].  

US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, known for his hardline policies on the Soviet Union, initiated in 1979 a campaign supporting [[mujaheddin]] in Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]], which was run by [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani security services]] with financial support from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and Britain's [[MI6]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html Interview with Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski-(13/6/97).]&lt;/ref&gt; This policy had the explicit aim of promoting radical [[Islamist]] and [[anti-Communist]] forces.  [[Bob Gates]], in his book ''Out Of The Shadows'', wrote that Pakistan had been pressuring the United States for arms to aid the rebels for years, but that the Carter administration refused in the hope of finding a diplomatic solution to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N_hfPrIMYuEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=from+the+shadows+robert+gates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oN0umDr35R&amp;sig=XSAOQ8XhK-OwqaDgszMeHSQjJ-k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yvUYTeigN46WsgPDg_2hAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=afghanistan&amp;f=false |title=From the Shadows, by Bob Gates, Pg. 146 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brzezinski seems to have been in favor of the provision of arms to the rebels, while [[Cyrus Vance]]'s State Department, seeking a peaceful settlement, publicly accused Brzezinski of seeking to &quot;revive&quot; the [[Cold War]].  Brzezinski has stated that the United States provided communications equipment and limited financial aid to the mujahideen prior to the &quot;formal&quot; invasion, but only in response to the Soviet deployment of forces to Afghanistan and the 1978 coup, and with the intention of preventing further Soviet encroachment in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGjAsQJh7OM&amp;feature=channel |title=Brzezinski and the Afghan War Pt2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, in a 1997 [[CNN]]/[[National Security Archive]] interview, Brzezinski detailed the strategy taken by the Carter administration against the Soviets in 1979:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We immediately launched a twofold process when we heard that the Soviets had entered Afghanistan. The first involved direct reactions and [[International sanctions|sanctions]] focused on the Soviet Union, and both the State Department and the National Security Council prepared long lists of sanctions to be adopted, of steps to be taken to increase the international costs to the Soviet Union of their actions. And the second course of action led to my going to [[Pakistan]] a month or so after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for the purpose of coordinating with the Pakistanis a joint response, the purpose of which would be to make the Soviets bleed for as much and as long as is possible; and we engaged in that effort in a collaborative sense with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], the [[Egypt]]ians, the British, the Chinese, and we started providing weapons to the Mujaheddin, from various sources again – for example, some Soviet arms from the Egyptians and the Chinese. We even got Soviet arms from the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] communist government, since it was obviously susceptible to material incentives; and at some point we started buying arms for the mujaheddin from the Soviet army in Afghanistan, because that army was increasingly corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html Full Text of Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To bolster the [[Parcham]] faction, the Soviet Union decided to intervene on December 24, 1979, when the [[Red Army]] invaded its southern neighbor. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion, which was backed by another one hundred thousand [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan military]] men and supporters of the Parcham faction. In the meantime, Hafizullah Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal. In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in the U.S. increased arming and funding of the Mujahideen thanks in large part to the efforts of [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Gust Avrakotos]]. Early reports estimated that $6–20 billion had been spent by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia&lt;ref name=&quot;greenleft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url =http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/24198 |title = How the CIA created Osama bin Laden| publisher = [[greenleft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent reports state that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia provided as much as up to $40 billion&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Ahram Democracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2010 |url =http://democracy.ahram.org.eg/eng/Index.asp?CurFN=selt2.htm&amp;DID=9995|title =Putting Empires at Rest| publisher = [[Al-Ahram Democracy]]}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Brunei Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2009 |url =http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban|title =Story of US, CIA and Taliban| publisher = [[The Brunei Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1999 |url =http://www.thenation.com/article/cost-afghan-victory?page=0,1|title =The Cost of an Afghan 'Victory' | publisher = [[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cash and weapons, which included over two thousand [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missiles]], for building up Islamic groups against the Soviet Union. The U.S. handled most of its support through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]. [[Saudi Arabia]] was also providing financial support. Leaders such as [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] received only minor aid compared to Hekmatyar and some of the other parties, although Massoud was named the &quot;Afghan who won the cold war&quot; by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url =http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title = Charlie Rose, March 2001, citing Wall Street Journal around 40:00 ff.| publisher = [[Charlie Rose]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.&lt;/ref&gt; and many more to the [[European Union]]. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Their withdrawal from Afghanistan was seen as an ideological victory in America, which had backed some Mujahideen factions through three U.S. presidential administrations to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[USSR]] continued to support President [[Mohammad Najibullah]] (former head of the Afghan secret service, ''[[KHAD]]'') until 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia:Afghanistan:History&quot;&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html Afghanistan: History], ''Columbia Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign interference and civil war===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989-1992)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992-1996)}}
'''1992-1996'''

After the fall of the communist Najibullah-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:

{{blockquote|The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the ''Islamic State of Afghanistan'', an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah government. [...] With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties [...] were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. [...] Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally. [...] Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;}}

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was directed, funded and supplied by the Pakistani army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = Neamatollah Nojumi| title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan analyst [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in his book ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':

{{blockquote|Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in Central Asia. [...] Islamabad could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders [...] to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. [...] Had it not been for the ISI's logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets, Hekmatyar's forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=352| publisher = I.B.

:&quot;The Taliban say: &quot;Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us&quot;, and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state.
