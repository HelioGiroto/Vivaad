'''Agriculture''' involving [[domestication]] of plants and animals was developed at least 10,000 years ago, although people began altering plant and animal communities for the own benefit through other means such as [[fire-stick farming]] even earlier&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming&lt;/ref&gt;. Agriculture has undergone significant developments since the time of the earliest cultivation. The [[Fertile Crescent]] of [[Western Asia]], Egypt, and India were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern China, Africa's [[Sahel]], [[New Guinea]] and several regions of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;In particular, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html?_r=1 the history of maize cultivation in southern Mexico dates back 9000 years.] ''New York Times'', accessdate=2010-5-4&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], [[fertilizers]], and [[pesticides]] were developed long ago but have made great strides in the past century. The [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints.

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the replacement of human labor by synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, [[selective breeding]], and [[Mechanized farming|mechanization]]. The recent history of agriculture has been closely tied with a range of political issues including [[water pollution]], [[biofuel]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[tariff]]s, and [[farm subsidies]]. In recent years, there has been a backlash against the [[externalities|external environmental effects]] of mechanized agriculture, and increasing support for the [[organic movement]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

==Early history==
Scholars have proposed a number of theories to explain the historical development of farming. Early forms of farming are called protofarming. The transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies, based on evidence from south west Asia and China indicates an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism, known as the [[Natufian]] in south West Asia and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that a range of resources were being used more intensively. Wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted. Evidence is also now emerging that the crops grown initially were wild and not domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, G. C. (1996) &quot;Late Pleistocene changes in wild plant-foods available to hunter-gatherers of the northern Fertile Crescent: Possible preludes to cereal cultivation&quot;. In D. R. Harris (ed.) ''The Origins and Spread of Agriculture and Pastoralism in Eurasia'', UCL Books, London, pp.159-203; Sato, Y. (2003) &quot;Origin of rice cultivation in the Yangtze River basin&quot;. In Y. Yasuda (ed.) ''The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture'', Roli Books, New Delhi, p.196; Gerritsen,R. (2008) ''Australia and the Origins of Agriculture'' Archaeopress, Oxford, pp.29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Crops such as emmer and einkorn wheat do not appear to have become domesticated until well into the Neolithic and 'ancient cultivated rice' (''Oryza sativa'') took 3000 years to become domesticated.

Localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the [[Levant]], the fact that farming was 'invented' at least three times elsewhere, suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental. When major climate change took place after the last [[ice age]] (c. 11,000 BC), much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} These conditions favoured [[annual plant]]s which die off in the long dry season, leaving a [[dormancy|dormant]] [[seed]] or [[tuber]]. These plants tended to put more energy into producing seeds than into woody growth. An abundance of readily storable wild grains and pulses enabled hunter-gatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time.

The '''Oasis Theory''' was proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, and popularized by [[Vere Gordon Childe]] who summarized the theory in his book ''Man Makes Himself''&lt;ref&gt;Childe, Gordon. (1936) ''Man Makes Himself'' (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier, communities contracted to oases where they were forced into close association with animals which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. The theory has little contemporary support{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, as the climate data for the time does not support the theory.

The '''[[Hilly Flanks]]''' hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros Mountains]], and that it developed from intensive focused [[grain]] gathering in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Redman (1978). ''Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East''. San Francisco, Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feasting''' model by [[Bryan Hayden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian|chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory|editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price|location=Madison|publisher=Prehistory Press|year=1992|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as throwing feasts to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food which drove agricultural technology.

The '''Demographic theories''' were proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last=Sauer|first=Carl, O|year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Binford|first=Lewis R.|year=1968|chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations
|title=New Perspectives in Archaeology|editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford|
publisher=Aldine Publishing Company|location=Chicago|pages=313–342|isbn=0-202-33022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]]. They describe an increasingly sedentary population, expanding up to the carrying capacity of the local environment, and requiring more food than can be gathered. Various social and economic factors help drive the need for food.

The '''evolutionary/intentionality theory''', advanced by scholars including [[David Rindos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|month=December|year=1987|isbn=978-0-12-589281-0)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea that agriculture is a co-evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, followed specialization of location and then domestication.

The '''Levantine Primacy Model''' was developed in the 1980s by Ofer Bar-Yosef and his collaborators. This provides a cultural ecology explanation, based on the idea that some areas were better favoured with domesticable plants and animals than others.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yosef, O. and Meadows, R. H. (1995) The origins of agriculture in the Near East. In T. D. Price and A. Gebauer (eds) ''Last Hunters – First Farmers: New Perspectives on the Prehistoric Transition to Agriculture'', pp.39-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''domestication theory''' put forth by [[Daniel Quinn]] and others states that ''first'' humans stayed in particular areas, giving up their nomadic ways, ''then'' developed agriculture and animal domestication.

Another theory is that humans were prevented from staying in one place for much of their history, due to the risk of attacks from other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10438216|title=DNA Analysis Illuminates the History of Man|date=2006-05-27|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Innovation and Specialisation Model''' was put forward recently by [[Rupert Gerritsen]], in ''Australia and the Origins of Agriculture'' (2008). This theory considers the question in terms of economic development and treats agriculture as a form of specialisation arising from two factors, higher population densities and innovation in areas of higher net natural productivity, and long-term advantageous information acquisition at nodal points in communication in long range scale-free networks.

===Neolithic era===
{{Main|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Sumer]]ian harvester's sickle, 3000 BC, made from baked clay.]]

Identifying the exact origin of agriculture remains problematic because the transition from hunter-gatherer societies began thousands of years before the invention of [[writing]].

[[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence from sites across [[Southwest Asia]] and [[North Africa]] indicate use of wild [[cereal|grain]] (e.g., from the c. 20,000 BC site of [[Ohalo II]] in [[Israel]], many [[Natufian]] sites in the [[Levant]] and from sites along the [[Nile]] in the 10th millennium BC). There is even evidence of planned cultivation and trait selection: grains of [[rye]] with domestic traits have been recovered from [[Epi-Palaeolithic]] (10,000+ BC) contexts at [[Abu Hureyra]] in [[Syria]], but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication.

Previously, [[paleoethnobotany|archaeobotanists]]/[[paleoethnobotany|paleoethnobotanists]] had traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics in search of the origins of agriculture. One notable example is the semi-tough [[rachis]] (and larger seeds) traced to just after the [[Younger Dryas]] (about 9500 BC) in the early [[Holocene]] in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. However, studies have demonstrated [[monophyletic]] characteristics attained without any sort human intervention, implying that what some may perceive as domestication among [[rachis]] could have occurred quite naturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS&quot;&gt;Robin G. Allaby, Dorian Q. Fuller, and Terence A. Brown, &quot;The genetic expectations of a protracted model for the origins of domesticated crops,&quot; in [[PNAS|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] of the [[USA]] (Sep. 16, 2008). Vol. 105, No. 37, pp. 13982-13986. [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13982.full] {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0803780105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the timescale insisted upon for rachis domestication (approx. 3,000 years) coincidentally has been demonstrated to directly coincide with the statistically generated timeframe numerically modeled that would be required for monophyly to be reached if a population were simply abandoned and left to only natural demands, implying that if any sort of human intervention had occurred at all then the timescale insisted upon should be considerably shorter (than 3,000 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS&quot; /&gt;

It was not until after 9500 BC that the eight so-called [[Neolithic founder crops|founder crops]] of agriculture appear: first [[emmer wheat|emmer]] and [[einkorn wheat]], then hulled [[barley]], [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]]s and [[flax]]. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] sites in the [[Levant]], although the consensus is that [[wheat]] was the first to be grown and harvested on a significant scale.

At around the same time (9400 BC), another study argues, [[parthenocarpic]] [[ficus|fig]] trees appear to have been domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai E. Kislev, Anat Hartmann, and Ofer Bar-Yosef, &quot;Early Domesticated Fig in the Jordan Valley,&quot; in [[Science Magazine]] (June 2, 2006). Vol. 312, No. 5778, pp. 1372-1374. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/crossref-forward-links/312/5778/1372] {{doi|10.1126/science.1125910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity associated with cutting branches off fig trees and replanting them alongside wild cereals owes to the basis of this argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Science Magazine]] (Dec. 15, 2006). Vol. 314, No. 5806, p. 1683. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5806/1683b Authors' critical response to commentary on study]. {{doi|10.1126/science.1132636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7000 BC, sowing and harvesting reached Mesopotamia, and there, in the fertile soil just north of the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Sumer]]ians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8000 BC farming was entrenched on the banks of the Nile River. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. [[Maize]] was first domesticated, probably from [[teosinte]], in the Americas around 3000-2700 BC, though there is some archaeological evidence of a much older development. The [[potato]], the [[tomato]], the [[capsicum|pepper]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], several varieties of [[legume|bean]], and several other plants were also developed in the New World, as was quite extensive [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] of steep hillsides in much of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]]. Agriculture was also independently developed on the island of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;Denham et al. (19 June 2003) &quot;Origins of Agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the Highlands of New Guinea&quot;. ''Science'' 301(5630):189-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], there is evidence of emmer and einkorn wheat, barley, sheep, goats and pigs that suggest a food producing economy in Greece and the Aegean by 7000 BC.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/eus/ht02eus.htm |title=Southern Europe, 8000–2000 B.C. &amp;#124; Timeline of Art History |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence from various sites on the [[Iberian peninsula]] suggest the domestication of plants and animals between 6000 and 4500 BC.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Céide Fields]] in [[Ireland]], consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 5500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsofmayo.com/ceide.htm |title=Ceide Fields Visitor Centre, Ballycastle, County Mayo, West of Ireland |publisher=Museumsofmayo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/309/ |title=Ceide Fields - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse was [[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in [[Ukraine]] around 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W. (2007). ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World]]''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], rice and [[millet]] were domesticated by 8000 BC, followed by the beans [[mung bean|mung]], [[soy]] and [[Azuki bean|azuki]]. In the [[Sahel]] region of [[Africa]] local rice and [[sorghum]] were domestic by 5000 BC. Local crops were domesticated independently in [[West Africa]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and possibly in [[New Guinea]] and [[Ethiopia]]. Evidence of the presence of [[wheat]] and some [[legumes]] in the 6th millennium BC have been found in the [[Indus Valley]]. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]s were cultivated in the same millennium. The crops grown in the valley around 4000 BC were typically wheat, [[pea]]s, [[sesame seed]], [[barley]], [[Date palm|date]]s and [[mango]]es. By 3500 BC [[cotton]] growing and cotton textiles were quite advanced in the valley. By 3000 BC farming of [[rice]] had started. Other monsoon crops of importance of the time was [[cane sugar]]. By 2500 BC, rice was an important component of the staple diet in [[Mohenjodaro]] near the [[Arabian Sea]]. By this time the Indians had large cities with well-stocked granaries. Three regions of the [[Americas]] independently domesticated [[maize|corn]], [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[potato]] and [[sunflowers]].

===Bronze age===
[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|left|Agricultural scene from Ancient Egypt.]]
By the [[Bronze Age]], wild food contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the usual diet. If the operative definition of ''agriculture'' includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]], organized [[irrigation]], and use of a specialized [[labour (economics)|labour]] force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the [[Sumer]]ians, starting c. 5500 BC. Intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering, and allows for the accumulation of excess product for off-season use, or to sell/barter. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with agriculture was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies. Sumerian agriculture supported a substantial territorial expansion which along with internecine conflict between cities, made them the first [[empire]] builders. Not long after, the Egyptians, powered by farming in the fertile [[Nile|Nile valley]], achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}

In [[Sumer]], barley was the primary crop; wheat, flax, dates, apples, plums, and grapes were grown as well. Mesopotamian agriculture was both supported and limited by flooding from the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers, as floods came in late spring or early summer from snow melting from the Anatolian mountains. The timing of the flooding, along with salt deposits in the soil, made farming in Mesopotamia difficult. Sheep and goats were domesticated, kept mainly for meat and milk, butter and cheese being made from the latter. [[Ur]], a large town that covered about 50 acres (20 hectares), had 10,000 animals kept in sheepfolds and stables and 3,000 slaughtered every year. The city's population of 6,000 included a labour force of 2,500, cultivating 3,000 acres (12&amp;nbsp;km²) of land. The labour force contained storehouse recorders, work foremen, overseers, and harvest supervisors to supplement labourers. Agricultural produce was given to temple personnel, important people in the community, and small farmers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The land was plowed by teams of oxen pulling light unwheeled plows and grain was harvested with [[sickle]]s in the spring. Wagons had solid wheels covered by leather tires kept in position by copper nails and were drawn by oxen and the [[Syrian wild !@#$%^&amp;*|Syrian onager]] (now extinct). Animals were harnessed by collars, [[yoke]]s, and headstalls. They were controlled by [[rein]]s, and a ring through the nose or upper lip and a strap under the jaw. As many as four animals could pull a wagon at one time. The horse was domesticated in Ukraine around 4000 BC, and was in use by the Sumerians around 2000 BC.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Classical antiquity===
{{Further|Agriculture in ancient Greece|Roman agriculture}}

In [[classical antiquity]], [[Roman agriculture]] built from techniques pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. Romans laid the groundwork for the [[manorial]] economic system, involving [[serfdom]], which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular [[iugerum]]). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;White, K. D. (1970), ''Roman Farming'' (Cornell University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;  There was a great deal of commerce between the provinces of the empire, all the regions of the empire became interdependent with one another, some provinces specialized in the production of grain, others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type.

==Regional histories==
===[[Europe]]===
European agriculture underwent a number of significant changes during the Middle Ages. Tools including the scythe and plow were improved from classical versions, a [[three field system]] of crop rotation was invented, and the [[moldboard plow]] and wheeled plow were increasingly used. [[Draft horse]]s were bred and increasingly used as a [[working animal]] in many parts of Europe, while [[oxen]] continued to be used for this purpose. Metal horseshoes were widely adopted. Much of Europe had low population densities during this period, to which [[extensive farming]] was well-suited. In parts of Southern Europe, more intensive farming combined techniques continued from classical Roman agriculture and those transferred from Islamic regions. In the late Middle Ages, the use of [[manure]] as fertilizer increased, which in turn decreased the necessity of regular fallowing of fields.

===[[China]]===
{{See|Agriculture in China|Agriculture (Chinese mythology)}}
Records from the [[Warring States]] (481 BC-221 BC), [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC-207 BC), and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD) provide a picture of early [[Agriculture in China|Chinese agriculture]] which included a nationwide [[granary]] system, and widespread use of [[sericulture]]. An important early Chinese book on agriculture is the ''Chimin Yaoshu'' of 535 AD, written by Jia Sixia.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 6 part 2 55 56&quot;&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Part 2''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Jia's writing style was straightforward and lucid relative to the elaborate and allusive writing typical of the time. Jia's book was also very long, with over one hundred thousand written [[Chinese characters]], and it quoted many other Chinese books that were written previously, but no longer survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 6 part 2 56&quot;/&gt; The contents of Jia's 6th century book include sections on land preparation, seeding, cultivation, orchard management, forestry, and animal husbandry. The book also includes peripherally related content covering trade and culinary uses for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 6 part 2 57&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The work and the style in which it was written proved influential on later Chinese [[agronomist]]s, such as [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] and his groundbreaking ''Nong Shu'' of 1313 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 6 part 2 56&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For agricultural purposes, the Chinese had innovated the [[hydraulic]]-powered [[trip hammer]] by the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 184&quot;&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. p184&lt;/ref&gt; Although it found other purposes, its main function to pound, decorticate, and polish grain that otherwise would have been done manually. The Chinese also innovated the square-pallet [[chain pump]] by the 1st century AD, powered by a [[waterwheel]] or [[oxen]] pulling an on a system of mechanical wheels.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 89 110&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 89, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the chain pump found use in [[public works]] of providing water for urban and palatial [[Pipeline transport|pipe systems]],&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 33&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling [[irrigation]] [[canal]]s and [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s for [[arable land|farmland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 110&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[New Guinea|Papua]]===
Ancient [[Papuan people]]s are thought to have begun practicing agriculture around 7000 BC. They began domesticating [[sugarcane]] and [[root crops]]. Pigs may also have been domesticated around this time. By 3000 BC, Papuan agriculture was characterized by water control for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], &quot;Melanesian cultures&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

===[[Mesoamerica]]===
{{Main|Agriculture in Mesoamerica}}
In Mesoamerica, wild [[teosinte]] was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern [[maize]], more than 6,000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.&lt;ref&gt;S. Johannessen and C. A. Hastorf (eds.) ''Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World'', Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and [[bean]]s. [[Theobroma cacao|Cocoa]] was also a major crop in domesticated Mexico and Central America. The [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], one of the most important meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.

In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Aztec]]s were active farmers and had an agriculturally focused economy. The land around [[Lake Texcoco]] was fertile, but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire. The Aztecs developed irrigation systems, formed [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] hillsides, and fertilized their soil. However, their greatest agricultural technique was the [[chinampa]]s, or artificial islands, also known as &quot;floating gardens&quot;. These were used to make the swampy areas around the lake suitable for farming. To make chinampas, canals were dug through the marshy islands and shores, then mud was heaped on huge mats made of woven [[Phragmites|reeds]]. The mats were anchored by tying them to posts driven into the lake bed and then planting trees at their corners that took root and secured the artificial islands permanently. The Aztecs grew corn, squash, vegetables, and flowers on chinampas.

===[[South America]]===
{{Main|Incan agriculture}}
In the Andes region of South America the major domesticated crop was [[potatoes]], domesticated perhaps 5,000 years ago. Large varieties of beans were domesticated, in South America, as well as animals, including [[llamas]], [[alpacas]], and [[guinea pigs]]. [[Coca]], still a major crop, was also domesticated in the Andes.

The Andean civilizations were predominantly agricultural societies; the Incas took advantage of the ground, conquering the adversities like the Andean area and the inclemencies of the weather. The adaptation of agricultural technologies that already were used previously, allowed the Incas to organize the production a diversity of products of the coast, mountain and jungle, so them could be able to redistribute to villages that did not have access to other regions. The technological achievements reached to agricultural level, had not been possible without the workforce that was at the disposal of the [[Sapa Inca]], as well as the road system that was allowing to store adequately the harvested resources and to distribute them for all the territory.

===Eastern [[North America]]===
{{Main|Eastern Agricultural Complex}}
The indigenous people of the Eastern U.S. appear to have domesticated numerous crops. [[Sunflowers]], [[tobacco]],&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, Carl B., Jr. (1992) On possible sources of the tobacco of prehistoric Eastern North America. ''Current Anthropology'' 33:54-56.&lt;/ref&gt; varieties of squash and [[Chenopodium]], as well as crops no longer grown, including [[marshelder]] and [[little barley]], were domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric Food Production in North America'', edited by Richard I. Ford. Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Anthropological Papers 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adair, Mary J. (1988) ''Prehistoric Agriculture in the Central Plains.'' Publications in Anthropology 16. University of Kansas, Lawrence.&lt;/ref&gt; Other wild foods may have undergone some selective cultivation, including [[wild rice]] and [[maple sugar]]. The most common varieties of [[Garden strawberry|strawberry]] were domesticated from Eastern North America.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Minnis (editor) (2003) ''People and Plants in Ancient Eastern North America.'' Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Two major crops, [[pecan]]s and [[Concord (grape)|Concord grapes]], were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but do not appear to have been domesticated until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pecankernel.tamu.edu/introduction/index.html |title=Pecans at Texas A&amp;M University |publisher=Pecankernel.tamu.edu |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Concord Grapes, http://www.concordgrape.org/bodyhistory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western [[North America]]===
{{Main|Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest}}

===[[Australia]]===
From the time British colonization of [[Australia]] began in 1788, [[Indigenous Australians]] were characterised as being nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]] who did not engage in agriculture or other forms of food production, despite some evidence to the contrary. Rhys Jones, however, proposed in 1969 that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning as a way of enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed [[fire-stick farming]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R. (1969) Fire-stick Farming. ''Australian Natural History'', 16:224&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the [[Gunditjmara]] and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, E. (1988) ''Complex Hunter-Gatherers: A Late Holocene Example from Temperate Australia''. British Archaeological Reports, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Harry Lournados suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Lourandos, H. (1997) ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; a process that appeared to have in progress over the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts have led [[Bill Gammage]] to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, B. (2011) ''The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines Made Australia: How Aborogones Made Australia''. Sydney, Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now being argued that in two regions of Australia, the central west coast and eastern central Australia, forms of early agriculture were being practiced, whereby plants were being sown or planted on a large scale and the yield being stored or preserved in significant amounts.&lt;ref&gt;Gerritsen 2008; Gammage 2011:281-304&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears that the people in these regions were living in permanent settlements of significant size (over 200 residents, possibly up to 1,000), in dwellings large enough to house 10 or more people, and they exhibited high degrees of sedentism. The Nhanda and Amangu of the central west coast grew yams (''Dioscorea hastifolia''), while various groups in eastern central Australia (the Corners Region) planted and harvested bush onions (''yaua'' - ''Cyperus bulbosus''), native millet (''cooly, tindil'' - ''Panicum decompositum'') and a sporocarp, ''ngardu'' (''Marsillea drumondii'').

===[[Islamic world]]===
{{Main|Arab Agricultural Revolution}}

From the 8th century, the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] underwent a transformation in agricultural practice which has been described by some as the &quot;Arab Agricultural Revolution&quot;. This transformation was driven by a number of factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along Muslim trade routes, the spread of more advanced farming techniques, and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency. The shift in agricultural practice led to significant changes in economy, [[population distribution]], vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, [[Urbanization|urban growth]], the distribution of the labour force, cooking and diet, clothing, and numerous other aspects of life in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Watson (1983), ''Agricultural Innovation in the Early Islamic World'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-24711-X.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Andrew M. Watson (1974), &quot;The Arab Agricultural Revolution and Its Diffusion, 700-1100&quot;, ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''34''' (1), p. 8-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim traders covered an expansive area of the [[Old World]], and these trade routes enabled the diffusion of many crops, plants and farming techniques across the Islamic world, as well as the adaptation of crops, plants and techniques from beyond the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt; Historian Andrew Watson has argued that this diffusion introduced a number of crops of major importance to Europe by way of [[Al-Andalus]], along with the techniques for their cultivation. Important crops involved in this transfer included sugar cane, rice, and cotton. A number of additional fruit trees, nut trees, and vegetables were also transferred.

Agricultural technologies that were widely adopted during this period included intensive irrigation systems, [[crop rotation]] systems, and use of agricultural manuals. A sophisticated system of irrigation made use of [[noria]]s, [[water mill]]s, water raising machines, dams and reservoirs. Some irrigation infrastructure and technology was continued from Roman times, and some introduced by Muslims.

===[[United Kingdom|Britain]]===
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Between the 16th century and the mid-19th century, [[Great Britain]] saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like [[enclosure]], [[mechanization]], [[four-field crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]] enabled an unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the early 19th century, agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before.

The 18th and 19th centuries also saw the development of glasshouses, or [[greenhouses]], initially for the protection and cultivation of exotic plants imported to Europe and North America from the tropics. [[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]] in the late 19th century yielded advances in the understanding of plant genetics, and subsequently, the development of hybrid crops. Increasing dependence upon monoculture crops lead to famines and food shortages, most notably the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)]]. [[Storage silo]]s and [[grain elevator]]s appeared in the 19th century.

==Age of Discovery==
The history of agriculture in the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[Early modern era]] was closely tied to the processes of European exploration and colonization. After 1492 the world's agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;!--Is this just Crosby's term or is it more widely used? Crosby's at first, but others use it. --&gt; Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the [[tomato]] became a favorite in European cuisine, and [[maize]] and [[potato]]es were widely adopted. Other transplanted crops include [[pineapple]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and [[tobacco]]. In the other direction, several wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans. Agriculture was a key element in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[triangular trade]], and the expansion by European powers into the Americas. In the expanding [[plantation economy]], large plantations producing crops including sugar, cotton, and [[indigo dye|indigo]], were heavily dependent upon [[slave labor]].

==Industrialization==
{{Main|Industrial agriculture}}
{{Main|Mechanized agriculture}}
{{Main|Green Revolution}}
[[File:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[tractor]] [[plough]]ing an [[alfalfa]] field]]

With the rapid rise of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]] in the late 19th century and 20th century, particularly in the form of the [[tractor]], and later the [[combine harvester]], farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible. These advances, joined to science-driven innovations in methods and resources, have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, Argentina, Israel, Germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit. The development of rail and highway networks and the increasing use of [[containerization|container shipping]] and [[refrigeration]] in developed nations have also been essential to the growth of mechanized agriculture, allowing for the economical long distance shipping of produce.

While chemical [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] have existed since the 19th century, their use grew significantly in the early 20th century. Until the development of chemical fertilizers, [[Guano]] was widely used as a fertilizer, though expensive. The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch method]] for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist [[Fritz Haber]]. In 1910 [[Carl Bosch]], while working for German chemical company [[BASF]], successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. [[Norman Borlaug]] and other scientists began developing crops for increased yields in the 1940s in Mexico. Their work lead to the [[Green Revolution]], which applied western advances in fertilizer and pesticide use to farms worldwide, with varying success. Other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include [[gene manipulation]], [[Hydroponics]], and the development of economically viable [[biofuel]]s such as [[Ethanol fuel|Ethanol]].

==Organic farming==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}
Though the intensive farming practices pioneered and extended in recent history generally led to increased outputs, they have also led to the destruction of farmland, most notably in the [[dust bowl]] area of the United States following World War I. As global population increases, agriculture continues to replace natural ecosystems with monoculture crops. Since the 1970s, western farmers and consumers have become increasingly aware of, and in some cases critical of, widely used intensive agriculture practices. This growing awareness has led to increased interest in such areas of agriculture as [[organic farming]], [[permaculture]], [[heirloom plant]]s and [[biodiversity]], the growth of the [[Slow Food]] movement, and an ongoing discussion surrounding the potential for [[sustainable agriculture]].
