[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in [[secretary hand]]: a script difficult for modern readers to interpret.&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, Charles Hamilton, John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) ISBN 0-944435-24-6&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Palaeography''' or '''Palæography''', [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelt]] '''paleography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παλαιός}} ''palaiós'', &quot;old&quot; and {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} ''graphein'', &quot;to write&quot;) is the study of ancient [[writing]]. Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;'Palaeography', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiceducationproject.org/legacy/projects/paleography/index.html |title=Latin Palaeography Network |publisher=Civiceducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Palaeography can be an essential skill for [[historian]]s and [[philology|philologists]], as it tackles two main difficulties. First, since the style of a single [[alphabet]] in each given language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual characters as they existed in various eras. Second, [[scribe]]s often used many [[abbreviation]]s, usually so as to write more quickly and sometimes to save space, so the specialist-palaeographer must know how to interpret them. Knowledge of individual letter-forms, ligatures, punctuation, and abbreviations enables the palaeographer to read and understand the text. The palaeographer must know, first, the language of the text (that is, a 21st-century English or French speaker must become expert in the relevant earlier forms of these languages); and second, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal/[[notary|notarial]] abbreviations. Philological knowledge of the language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time or place can help palaeographers identify ancient or more recent [[forgeries]] versus authentic documents.

Knowledge of writing materials is also essential to the study of handwriting and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced.&lt;ref name=fn_3&gt;Robert P. Gwinn, &quot;Paleography&quot; in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], Micropaedia, Vol. IX, 1986, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin: this is why the palaeographer must take into account the style and formation of the manuscript and the handwriting used in it.&lt;ref name=fn_4&gt;Fernando De Lasala, Exercise of Latin Paleography (Gregorian University Rome, 2006) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of writing in South India}}
The earliest attested form of writing in [[South India]] is inscriptions found in caves, associated with the [[Chalukya]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the [[Cave character]], and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of [[Vatteluttu]], the exact origins of which are unknown, and [[Nandinagari]], which is a variant of [[Devanagari]] that developed due to later Northern influence.

===History of Latin palaeography===
[[Jean Mabillon]], a French Benedictine monk, scholar and [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], whose work ''De re diplomatica'' was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and [[diplomatics]]. However, the actual term &quot;palaeography&quot; was coined (in Latin) by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], a [[Benedictine monk]], in the title of his ''Palaeographia Graeca'' (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard de Montfaucon et al., ''Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum'', Paris, Ludovicum Guerin (1708).&lt;/ref&gt; With their establishment of paleography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit [[Daniel Papebroch]] who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'' Fourth Edition (Oxford University, 2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century such scholars as [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]], [[Leopold Delisle]] and [[Ludwig Traube]] contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the 'New French School' of paleographers, especially Jean Mallon, gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.&lt;ref name=fn_2&gt;R. Marichal, “Paleography” in New Encyclopaedia New York: Gale-Thomson, 2003 Vol.X, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
====Pre-Caroline====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;James J. John, &quot;Latin Paleography&quot;, in J. Powell, ''Medieval Studies'' 2nd. ed. (Syracuse: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1992), 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk [[Augustine of Canterbury]] to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy's dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the invasions by the [[Lombards]], its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernhard Bischoff, ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', trans. Daibi O Croinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1990), 83-112; 190-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th through the 8th centuries a number of so-called 'National Hands' were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late-6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;John, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carolingian minuscule====

Beginning in the 8th century, as [[Charlemagne]] began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script ([[caroline minuscule]]) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th century. Simplistically speaking, the only 'national hands'  to continue were the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] (or Mozarabic), which survived into the 12th or 13th century; the [[Beneventan script|Beneventan]], which was still being used in the middle of the 16th century; and Insular script, which was used to write texts in the [[Irish language|Irish]] at least through the 20th century and formed the basis for [[Gaelic type]], just as [[caroline minuscule]] formed the basis for [[Roman type]].

====Gothic minuscule====

In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanistic]] scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian [[Renaissance]] all over Europe.

====Further medieval scripts====

*[[Beneventan script]]
*[[Insular script|Gaelic script]]
*[[Insular script]]
*[[Merovingian script]]
*[[Uncial script]]
*[[Visigothic script]]

===Modern period===

These humanistic scripts are the base for the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the ''[[Kurrentschrift]]'' was rooted in the [[cursive]] handwriting of the later [[Middle Ages]].  With the name of the [[calligrapher]] Ludwig [[Sütterlin]], this handwriting counterpart to the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s was abolished by [[Hitler]] in 1941. After [[World War II]], it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. [[Secretary hand]] is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.
