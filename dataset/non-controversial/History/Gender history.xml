'''Gender history''' is a sub-field of [[history]] and [[gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]].

==Impact==
Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of [[history]]. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes, but always making an impact of some kind on the historical discipline. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle, even though they may be more politically groundbreaking in the end.

===Within the Profession===
According to historian [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], conflict occurred between Women's History [[List of historians|historians]] and other historians in a number of ways.&lt;ref name = &quot;scott&quot;&gt;&quot;Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis,&quot; [[American Historical Review]]
91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Historical Association]], when [[feminism|feminists]] argued that female historians were treated unequally within the field and underrepresented in the association, they were essentially leveling charges of historical negligence by traditional historians. Notions of [[professional]]ism were not rejected outright, but they were accused of being biased.

===Supplementary History===
According to Scott, the construction of Women's History as &quot;supplementary&quot; to the rest of history had a similar effect. At first glance, a supplement simply adds information which has been missing from the greater story, but as Scott points out, it also questions why the information was left out in the first place. Whenever it is noticed that a woman found to be missing from written history, Women's History first describes her role, second, examines which mechanisms allowed her role to be omitted, and third, asks to what other information these mechanisms were blind.

===Gender Theory===
Finally, the advent of [[gender studies|gender theory]] once again challenged commonly held ideas of the discipline, including those scholars studying Women's History. [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]] criticism of essentialising [[social construction|socially constructed]] groups, be they [[gender]] groups or otherwise, pointed out the weaknesses in various sorts of history. In the past, [[historian]]s have attempted to describe the shared experience of large numbers of people, as though these people and their experiences were homogeneous and uniform. Women have multiple identities, influenced by any number of factors including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], and any examination of history which conflates their experiences, fails to provide an accurate picture.
