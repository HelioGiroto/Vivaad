The '''Adena culture''' was a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture that existed from 1000 to 200 BC, in a time known as the [[Woodland period#Early Woodland period (1000–1 BCE)|Early Woodland period]]. The Adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system. The Adena lived in a variety of locations, including: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and parts of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]].

==Importance==

Adena sites are concentrated in a relatively small area - maybe 200 sites in the central Ohio Valley, with perhaps another 200 scattered throughout [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]], although they may once have numbered in the thousands. The importance of the Adena complex comes from its considerable influence on other contemporary and succeeding cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabrillo.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/adena.html| title = Native Peoples of North America–Adena| accessdate = 2008-09-12 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080920160044/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/adena.html| archivedate= 20 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adena culture is seen as the precursor to the traditions of the [[Hopewell culture]], which are sometimes thought as an elaboration, or zenith, of Adena traditions.

The Adena were notable for their agricultural practices, pottery, artistic works and extensive trading network, which supplied them with a variety of raw materials, ranging from copper from the Great Lakes to shells from the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history-world.org/Civilizations%20Of%20The%20Americas.htm| title = Civilizations Of The Americas, The Peoples To The North | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~mdeal/Anth3291/notes7.htm| title = Early Woodland: Northeastern Middlesex Tradition | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/sites/gravecreek.html| title = Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Adena culture was named for the large mound on Thomas Worthington's early 19th-century estate called &quot;Adena&quot;, in [[Chillicothe, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oplin.org/point/people/erwdpeop.html| title = Identifying Flint Artifacts/Early Woodland People| accessdate = 2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and religion==
===Mounds===
Lasting traces of Adena culture are still seen in their substantial [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]. Once Adena mounds numbered in the hundreds, but only a number of Adena earthen monuments still survive today. These [[mound]]s generally ranged in size from {{convert|20|ft|m}} to {{convert|300|ft|m}} in diameter and served as burial structures, ceremonial sites, historical markers and possibly gathering places. These mounds were built using hundreds of thousands of baskets full of specially selected and graded earth. According to archaeological investigations, Adena mounds were usually built as part of burial ritual, in which the earth of the mound was piled immediately atop a burned mortuary building. These mortuary buildings were intended to keep and maintain the dead until their final burial was performed. Before the construction of the mounds, some utilitarian and grave goods would be placed on the floor of the structure, which was burned with the goods and honored dead within. The mound would then be constructed, and often a new mortuary structure would be placed atop the new mound. After a series of repetitions, mound/mortuary/mound/mortuary, a quite prominent earthwork would remain. In the later Adena period, circular ridges of unknown function were sometimes constructed around the burial mounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabrillo.edu&quot;/&gt; Adena mounds stood in isolation from domestic living areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena-Definition from Answers.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/adena-culture| title = Adena-Definition from Answers.com| accessdate = 2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shamanism===

Although the mounds are beautiful artistic achievements themselves, Adena artists created smaller, more personal pieces of art. Art motifs that became important to many later Native Americans began with the Adena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena-Definition from Answers.com&quot;/&gt; Motifs such as the weeping eye and cross and circle design became mainstays in many succeeding cultures. Many pieces of art seemed to revolve around [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices, and the transformation of humans into animals—particularly birds, wolves, bears and deer—and back to human form. This may indicate a belief that the practice imparted the animals' qualities to the wearer or holder of the objects. Deer antlers, both real and constructed of copper, wolf, deer and mountain lion jawbones, and many other objects were fashioned into costumes, necklaces and other forms of regalia by the Adena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power 2004 29–34&quot;&gt;{{cite book |  last = Power | first = Susan |  title = [[Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings]] | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 29–34 |  isbn = 978-0-8203-2501-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive tubular smoking pipes, with either flattened or blocked-end mouthpieces, suggest the offering of smoke to the spirits. The objective of pipe smoking may have been altered states of consciousness, achieved through the use of the hallucinogenic plant [[Nicotiana rustica]]. All told, Adena was a manifestation of a broad regional increase in the number and kind of artifacts devoted to spiritual needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena-Definition from Answers.com&quot;/&gt;

===Stone tablets===
The Adena also carved small stone tablets, usually 4 or 5&amp;nbsp;inches by 3 or 4&amp;nbsp;inches by .5&amp;nbsp;inches thick. On one or both flat sides were gracefully composed stylized zoomorphs or curvilinear geometric designs in deep relief. Paint has been found on some Adena tablets, leading archaeologists to propose that these stone tablets were probably used to stamp designs on cloth or animal hides, or onto their own bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power 2004 29–34&quot;/&gt; Its possible they were used to outline designs for [[tattoo]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena-Definition from Answers.com&quot;/&gt;

===Pottery===

Unlike in other cultures, Adena [[Native American pottery|pottery]] was not buried with the dead or the remains of the cremated, as were other artifacts. Usually tempered with grit or crushed limestone, it was largely plain, cord-marked or fabric marked, although one type bore a nested-diamond design incised into its surface. The vessel shapes were sub-conoidal or flat-bottomed jars, sometimes with small foot-like supports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena Site&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indians-artifact.com/adena.php| title = Adena Site| accessdate = 2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic life==
===Settlement patterns===
The large and elaborate mound sites served a nearby scattering of people. The population was dispersed in small settlements of one to two structures. A typical house was built in a circle form from 15 to 45 feet in diameter. The walls were made of paired posts tilted outward, joined to other wood to form a cone shaped roof. The roof was then covered with bark and the walls may have been bark and/or wickerwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adena.com/adena/ad/ad01.htm| title = The Adena Mounds| accessdate = 2008-09-12 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010451/http://www.adena.com/adena/ad/ad01.htm| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food sources===
Their subsistence was acquired through foraging and the cultivation of native plants.
* Hunted deer, elk, black bear, woodchuck, beaver, porcupine, turkey, trumpeter swan, ruffed grouse
* Gathered several edible seed grasses and nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.larryjzimmerman.com/naarch/adena.htm| title = NA Archaeology : Adena| accessdate = 2008-09-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627165802/http://www.larryjzimmerman.com/naarch/adena.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cultivated [[pumpkin]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[sunflower]], and [[Chenopodium|goosefoot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena-Definition from Answers.com&quot;/&gt;

===Tools===
The Adena ground stone tools and axes. Somewhat rougher slab-like stones with chipped edges were probably used as hoes. Bone and antler were used in small tools but even more prominently in ornamental objects such as beads, combs, and worked animal-jaw [[gorget]]s or paraphernalia. Spoons, beads and other implements were made from the marine [[conch]]. A few copper axes have been found, but otherwise the metal was hammered into ornamental forms, such as bracelets, rings, beads, and reel-shaped pendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adena Site&quot;/&gt;
