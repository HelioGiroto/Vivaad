}}
The '''history of [[Bangladesh]]''' as a [[nation state]] began in 1971, when it seceded from [[Pakistan]]. Prior to the creation of Pakistan in 1947, modern-day Bangladesh was part of [[Maurya Empire|ancient]], [[Pala Empire|classical]], [[Mughal Empire|medieval]] and [[British Raj|colonial]] [[India]].

The area's early history featured a succession of [[List of Indian monarchs|Indian empires]],  internal squabbling, and a tussle between [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] for dominance. [[Islam]] made its first appearance during the 12th century when [[Sufi]] missionaries arrived. Later, occasional Muslim rulers reinforced the process of conversion by building [[mosques]], [[madrassas]] and Sufi [[Khanqah]].

The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in 1947, when the region became [[East Pakistan]], part of the newly formed [[Islamic State]] of [[Pakistan]]. However, it was separated from the [[West Pakistan|western wing]] by {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, as well as economic neglect by the politically dominant West Pakistan, popular agitation led by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] grew against [[West Pakistan]], resulting in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971, which the [[Bengali people]] won with the support of India. After independence, the new state endured [[Bangladesh famine of 1974|famine]], [[Floods in Bangladesh|natural disasters]] and [[Poverty in Bangladesh|widespread poverty]], as well as political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress.

== Etymology of ''Bengal'' ==
{{See also|History of Bengal}}
The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' or Bengal is unknown. According to [[Mahabharata]], [[Purana]], [[Harivamsha]] Vanga was one of the adopted sons of King Vali who founded the [[Vanga Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;riaj&quot;&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=07601010&amp;ct=11 RIYAZU-S-SALĀTĪN: A History of Bengal], [[Ghulam Husain Salim]], The Asiatic Society, Calcutta, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to &quot;Vangala&quot; (''Bôngal'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 AD) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala. Shams-ud-din [[Ilyas Shah]] took the title &quot;Shah-e-Bangalah&quot; and united the whole region under one government for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;paxgaea.com&quot;&gt;http://www.paxgaea.com/HRBangladesh.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vanga Kingdom (also known as Banga) was located in the eastern part of the Indian Subcontinent, comprising part of West Bengal, India and present-day modern Bangladesh. Vanga and Pundra were two dominant tribes in Bangladesh in ancient time. The [[Hindu]] epic [[Mahabharata]] mentions that the Vanga and Pundra kings took part in the battle of Kurukshetra. Kouravas and Pandavas fought this battle near Delhi about three thousand years back.

==Ancient period==
{{see also|Anga|Gangaridai|Magadha|Pundra Kingdom|Suhma Kingdom|Vanga Kingdom}}

===Pre-historic Bengal===
{{main|Prehistoric South Asia}}
The original settlers spoke non-[[Indo-Aryan languages|Aryan]] languages—they may have spoken [[Austric languages|Austric]] or [[Austro-Asiatic languages]] like the languages of the present-day Kola, [[Bhil]], [[Santals|Santal]], Shabara and Pulinda peoples. At a subsequent age, peoples speaking languages from two other language families—[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]—seem to have settled in Bengal.

===Bengal in mythology===
Some references indicate that the early people in Bengal were different in ethnicity and culture from the Vedic beyond the boundary of Aryandom and who were classed as '[[Dasyus]]'. The Bhagavata Purana classes them as sinful people while Dharmasutra of Bodhayana prescribes expiatory rites after a journey among the Pundras and Vangas. [[Mahabharata]] speaks of [[Paundraka Vasudeva]] who was lord of the Pundrasand who allied himself with Jarasandha against Krishna. Mahabharata also speaks of Bengali kings called Chitrasena and Sanudrasena who were defeated by Bhima. Kalidas mentions that Raghu defeated a coalition of Vanga kings and established a victory column in the Gangetic delta.

===Protohistory===
[[File:BD Mahasthangarh1.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Mahasthangarh]] is the oldest archaeological site in [[Bangladesh]]. It dates back to 700 BCE and was the ancient capital of the [[Pundra Kingdom]].]]
Hindu scriptures such as the [[Mahabharata]] say that Bangladesh was divided among the Janapadas: [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] (southern Bengal), [[Pundra Kingdom|Pundra]] (northern Bengal), and [[Suhma Kingdom|Suhma]] (western Bengal) according to their respective totems.  Scriptures identify Vanga and [[Anga]] in Bangladesh as Indo-Aryan. While western Bangladesh, as part of [[Magadha]], became part of the Indo-Aryan civilization by the 7th century BCE, the [[Nanda Dynasty]] was the first historical state to unify all of Bangladesh under Indo-Aryan rule.

===Overseas Colonization===
The [[Vanga Kingdom]] was a powerful seafaring nation of [[Ancient India (disambiguation)|Ancient India]]. They had overseas trade relations with [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] (modern day [[Thailand]]). According to [[Mahavamsa]], the [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] prince [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya Singha]] conquered [[Lanka]] (modern day [[Sri Lanka]]) in 544 BC and gave the name &quot;[[Sinhala (disambiguation)|Sinhala]]&quot; to the country. [[Bengali people]] migrated to the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Siam]] (in modern Thailand), establishing their own colonies there.&lt;ref name=&quot;paxgaea.com&quot;/&gt;

===Gangaridai Empire===
{{main|Gangaridai}}
[[Image:Asia 323bc.jpg|thumb|300px|Asia in 323BC, the [[Nanda Empire]] and [[Gangaridai|Gangaridai Empire]] in relation to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s Empire and neighbors.]]
Though north and west Bengal were part of the Magadhan empire southern Bengal thrived and became powerful with her overseas trades. In 326 BCE, with the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]] the region again came to prominence. The Greek and Latin historians suggested that Alexander the Great withdrew from India anticipating the valiant counter attack of the mighty [[Gangaridai]] empire that was located in the Bengal region. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]], was convinced that it was better to return. [[Diodorus Siculus]] mentions Gangaridai to be the most powerful empire in India whose king possessed an army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war. The allied forces of [[Gangaridai|Gangaridai Empire]] and [[Nanda Empire]] (Prasii) were preparing a massive counter attack against the forces of Alexander on the banks of Ganges. Gangaridai, according to the Greek accounts, kept on flourishing at least up to the 1st century AD.

==Early Middle Ages==
The pre-Gupta period of Bengal is shrouded with obscurity. Before the conquest of [[Samudragupta]] Bengal was divided into two kingdoms: Pushkarana and Samatata. [[Chandragupta II]] had defeated a confederacy of [[Vanga]] kings resulting in Bengal becoming part of the Gupta Empire.

=== Gauda Kingdom ===
By the 6th century, the Gupta Empire ruling over the northern Indian subcontinent was largely broken up. [[East Bengal|Eastern Bengal]] became the [[Vanga Kingdom]] while the [[Gauḍa region|Gauda]] kings rose in the west with their capital at Karnasuvarna ([[Murshidabad]]). [[Shashanka]], a vassal of the last Gupta Empire became independent and  unified the smaller principalities of Bengal (Gaur, Vanga, Samatata) and vied for regional power with [[Harshavardhana]] in northern India. But this burst of Bengali power did not last beyond his death, as Bengal descended afterwards into a period marked by disunity and foreign invasion.The development of the [[Bengali calendar]] is also often attributed to [[Shashanka]] as the starting date falls squarely within his reign(600 AD–626 AD).

===The Pala dynasty===
{{main|Pala Empire}}
{{double image|right|Pala Empire (Dharmapala).gif|160|Devapala.jpg|160|[[Pala Empire]] under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]]|'''Pala Empire''' under [[Devapala]]}}
[[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] were the first independent [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] dynasty of Bengal. The name ''Pala'' ({{lang-bn|পাল}} ''pal'') means ''protector'' and was used as an ending to the names of all Pala monarchs. The Palas were followers of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] schools of Buddhism. [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to power in 750 in [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] by a [[democratic]] [[election]]. This event is recognized as one of the first [[democratic]] elections in [[South Asia]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas|Mahā Janapadas]]. He reigned from 750-770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of [[Bengal]]. The [[Buddhist]] [[dynasty]] lasted for four centuries (750-1120 AD) and ushered in a period of stability and prosperity in [[Bengal]]. They created many temples and works of art as well as supported the Universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]]. [[Somapura Mahavihara]] built by [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] is the greatest [[Buddhist]] [[Vihara]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]].
[[Image:Paharpur 03.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Somapura Mahavihara]] in Bangladesh is the greatest [[Buddhist]] [[Vihara]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], built by [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]].]]

The empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]]. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. This triggered once more for the control of the subcontinent. [[Devapala]], successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond. His empire stretched from [[Assam]] and [[Utkala]] in the east, [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] (modern day [[Afghanistan]]) in the north-west and [[Deccan]] in the south. According to Pala copperplate inscription Devapala exterminated the Utkalas, conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the [[Huna (people)|Huna]], and humbled the lords of [[Gurjara]], [[Pratihara]]s and the [[Dravida]]s.
[[Image:IndianBuddha11.JPG|thumb|[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s, 11th century, [[Pala Empire]]]]

The death of Devapala ended the period of ascendancy of the Pala Empire and several independent dynasties and kingdoms emerged during this time. However, [[Mahipala]] − I rejuvenated the reign of the Palas. He recovered control over all of Bengal and expanded the empire. He survived the invasions of [[Rajendra Chola]] and the [[Chalukyas]]. After Mahipala − I the Pala dynasty again saw its decline until [[Ramapala]], the last great ruler of the dynasty, managed to retrieve the position of the dynasty to some extent. He crushed the [[Varendra]] rebellion and extended his empire farther to [[Kamarupa]], Orissa and Northern India.

The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal. Never had the Bengali people reached such height of power and glory to that extent. Palas were responsible for the introduction of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Myanmar]]. The Pala had extensive trade as well as influence in [[south-east Asia]]. This can be seen in the sculptures and architectural style of the [[Sailendra|Sailendra Empire]] (present-day [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]]).

===Sena dynasty===
{{main|Sena Empire}}
The Palas were followed by the [[Sena dynasty]] who brought [[Bengal]] under one ruler during the 12th century. [[Vijay Sen]] the second ruler of this dynasty defeated the last [[Pala Empire|Pala emperor]] [[Madanapala]] and established his reign. [[Ballal Sena]] introduced [[caste system]] in Bengal and made [[Nabadwip]] the capital. The fourth king of this dynasty [[Lakshman Sen]] expanded the empire beyond Bengal to [[Bihar]]. Lakshman fled to eastern Bengal under the onslaught of the Muslims without facing them in battle. The Sena dynasty brought a period of revival in [[Hinduism]] in Bengal. A popular myth comprehended by some Bengali authors about [[Jayadeva]], the famous Sanskrit poet of [[Orissa]] (then known as the [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]]) and author of [[Gita Govinda]], was one of the ''Pancharatnas'' (meaning 5 gems) in the court of Lakshman Sen (although this may be disputed by some).

==Late Middle Ages - arrival of Islam==
[[Islam]] made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when [[Sufi]] missionaries arrived. Beginning in 1202, a military commander from the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Muhammad Khilji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], overran [[Bihar]] and Bengal as far east as [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bogra]] and the [[Brahmaputra River]]. The defeated Laksman Sen and his two sons moved to a place then called [[Munshiganj District|Vikramapur]] (present-day [[Munshiganj District]]), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.

Hindu states continued to exist in the Southern and the Eastern parts of Bengal till the 1450s such as the [[Deva dynasty]]. Also, the Ganesha dynasty began with [[Raja Ganesha]] in 1414, but his successors converted to Islam. There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the [[Mughal period]] like those of [[Maharaja]] [[Pratapaditya]] of [[Jessore]] and [[Raja Sitaram Ray]] of [[Burdwan]]. These kingdoms contributed a lot to the economic and cultural landscape of Bengal. Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and intrastate trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, these served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks. Many of these kingdoms are recorded to have fallen during the late 1700s. While [[Koch Bihar|Koch Bihar Kingdom]] in the North, flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals also and survived till the advent of the British.

===Deva Kingdom===
The '''[[Deva dynasty|Deva Kingdom]]''' was a [[Hindu]] dynasty of medieval [[Bengal]] that ruled over eastern Bengal after the collapse [[Sena Empire]]. The capital of this dynasty was [[Bikrampur]] in present-day [[Munshiganj District]] of [[Bangladesh]]. The inscriptional evidences show that his kingdom was extended up to the present-day [[Comilla District|Comilla]]-[[Noakhali district|Noakhali]]-[[Chittagong District|Chittagong]] region. A later ruler of the dynasty ''Ariraja-Danuja-Madhava'' Dasharatha-Deva  extended his kingdom to cover much of [[East Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Niharranjan (1993). ''Bangalir Itihas: Adiparba'' Calcutta: Dey's Publishing, ISBN 81-7079-270-3, pp.408-9&lt;/ref&gt; The end of this dynasty is not yet known.

===Turkic rule===
====Khilji maliks====
The period after Bakhtiar Khilji's death in 1207 devolved into infighting among the Khiljis - representative of a pattern of succession struggles and intra-empire intrigues during later Turkic regimes. Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Khalji prevailed and extended the Sultan's domain south to [[Jessore]] and made the eastern Bang province a tributary. The capital was made at [[Lakhnauti]] on the Ganges near the older Bengal capital of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]]. He managed to make [[Kamarupa]] and Trihut pay tribute to him. But he was later defeated by Shams-ud-Din [[Iltutmish]].

====Mameluk rule====
The weak successors of Iltutmish encouraged the local governors to declare independence. Bengal was sufficiently remote from Delhi that its governors would declare independence on occasion, styling themselves as Sultans of Bengal. It was during this time that Bengal earned the name &quot;Bulgakpur&quot; (land of the rebels). Tughral Togun Khan added [[Oudh]] and [[Bihar]] to Bengal. Mughisuddin Yuzbak also conquered Bihar and Oudh from Delhi but was killed during an unsuccessful expedition in Assam. Two Turkic attempts to push east of the broad [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] and Brahmaputra rivers were repulsed, but a third led by [[Mughisuddin Tughral]] conquered the [[Sonargaon]] area south of Dhaka to [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], bringing the Sen Kingdom officially to an end by 1277. Mughisuddin Tughral repulsed two massive attacks of the sultanate of Delhi before finally being defeated and killed by [[Ghiyas ud din Balban]].,

====Mahmud Shahi dynasty====
Mahmud Shahi dynasty started when Nasiruddin Bughra Khan declared independence in Bengal. Thus Bengal regained her independence back. Nasiruddin Bughra Khan and his successors ruled Bengal for 23 years finally being incorporated into Delhi Sultanate by Ghyiasuddin Tughlaq.

===Ilyas Shahi dynasty===
[[File:Shat Gombuj Mosque (ষাট গম্বুজ মসজিদ) 002.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sixty Dome Mosque]] in [[Mosque city of Bagerhat]] was built in the 15th century and is the largest historical mosque in Bangladesh, as well as a [[World Heritage site]].]]
[[Shamsuddin Iliyas Shah]] founded an independent dynasty that lasted from 1342-1487. The dynasty successfully repulsed attempts by Delhi to conquer them. They continued to reel in the territory of modern-day Bengal, reaching to [[Khulna]] in the south and [[Sylhet]] in the east. The sultans advanced civic institutions and became more responsive and &quot;native&quot; in their outlook and cut loose from Delhi. Considerable architectural projects were completed including the massive [[Adina Mosque]] and the Darasbari Mosque which still stands in Bangladesh near the border. The Sultans of [[Bengal]] were patrons of [[Bengali literature]] and began a process in which Bengali culture and identity would flourish. The Ilyas Shahi Dynasty was interrupted by an uprising by the Hindus under [[Raja Ganesha]]. However the Ilyas Shahi dynasty was restored by [[Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah]].

===Ganesha dynasty===
The Ganesha dynasty began with [[Raja Ganesha]] in 1414. After Raja Ganesha seized control over Bengal he faced an imminent threat of invasion. Ganesha appealed to a powerful Muslim holy man named [[Qutb al Alam]], to stop the threat. The saint agreed on the condition that [[Raja Ganesha]]'s son Jadu would convert to [[Islam]] and rule in his place. [[Raja Ganesha]] agreed and Jadu started ruling [[Bengal]] as ''[[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]]'' in 1415 AD. Qutb al Alam died in 1416 AD and [[Raja Ganesha]] was emboldened to depose his son and accede to the throne himself as ''Danujamarddana Deva''. Jalaluddin was reconverted to [[Hinduism]] by the ''Golden Cow'' ritual. After the death of his father he once again converted to [[Islam]] and started ruling his second phase.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical encyclopedia of Sufis By N. Hanif, pg.320&lt;/ref&gt; Jalaluddin's son, [[Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah]] ruled for only 3 years due to chaos and anarchy. The dynasty is known for their liberal policy as well as justice and charity.

===Hussain Shahi dynasty===
The Habshi rule gave way to the [[Hussain Shahi dynasty]] that ruled from 1494-1538. [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]], considered as the greatest of all the sultans of Bengal for bringing cultural renaissance during his reign. He extended the sultanate all the way to the port of [[Chittagong]], which witnessed the arrival of the first Portuguese merchants. [[Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah]] gave refuge to the Afghan lords during the invasion of [[Babur]] though he remained neutral. However Nusrat Shah made a treaty with Babur and saved Bengal from a Mughal invasion. The last Sultan of the dynasty, who continued to rule from [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]], had to contend with rising Afghan activity on his northwestern border. Eventually, the Afghans broke through and sacked the capital in 1538 where they remained for several decades until the arrival of the Mughals.

===Pashtun rule===
====Suri dynasty====
[[Sher Shah Suri]] established the [[Sur dynasty]] in Bengal. After the battle of Chausa he declared himself independent Sultan of Bengal and Bihar. Sher Shah was the only Muslim Sultan of Bengal to establish an empire in northern India. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] Islam Shah appointed Muhammad Khan Sur as the governor of Bengal. After the death of Islam Shah, Muhammad Khan Sur became independent. Muhammad Khan Sur was followed by Ghyiasuddin Bahadur Shah and Ghyiasuddin Jalal Shah. The Pashtun rule in Bengal remained for 44 years. Their most impressive achievement was Sher Shah's construction of the [[Grand Trunk Road]] connecting [[Sonargaon]], [[Delhi]] and [[Kabul]].

====Karrani dynasty====
The Sur dynasty was followed by the Karrani dynasty. [[Sulaiman Khan Karrani]] annexed Orissa to the Muslim sultanate permanently. [[Daoud Shah Karrani]] declared independence from Akbar which led to four years of bloody war between the Mughals and the Pashtuns. The Mughal onslaught against the Pashtun Sultan ended with the battle of [[Rajmahal]] in 1576, led by Khan Jahan. However, the Pashtun and the local landlords ([[Baro Bhuyans]]) led by [[Isa Khan]] resisted the Mughal invasion.

==Mughal period==
[[Image:Lalbager Kella 01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Lalbagh Fort]] was developed by [[Shaista Khan]].]]
Bengal came once more under the control of Delhi as the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] conquered it in 1576. At that time [[Dhaka]] became a Mughal provincial capital. But it remained remote and thus a difficult to govern the region especially the section east of the [[Brahmaputra]] River remained outside the mainstream of Mughal politics. The Bengali ethnic and linguistic identity further crystallized during this period, since the whole of Bengal was united under an able and long-lasting administration. Furthermore its inhabitants were given sufficient autonomy to cultivate their own customs and literature.

In 1612, during Emperor [[Jahangir]]'s reign, the defeat of Sylhet completed the Mughal conquest of Bengal with the exception  of [[Chittagong]]. At this time Dhaka rose in prominence by becoming the provincial capital of Bengal. Chittagong was later annexed in order to stifle Arakanese raids from the east. A well-known Dhaka landmark, [[Lalbagh Fort]], was built during Aurangzeb's sovereignty.

==The Nawabs of Bengal (1717–1880)==

[[Murshid Quli Khan]] ended the nominal Mughal rule in 1717 when he declared Bangladesh's independence from the Mughal empire. He shifted the capital to [[Murshidabad]] ushering in a series of independent Bengal [[Nawab]]s.

From 1717 until 1880, three successive Islamic dynasties — the Nasiri, Afshar and Najafi — all related by bloodlines, ruled Bengal:

The first dynasty, the Nasiri, ruled from 1717 until 1740. The founder of the Nasiri, [[Murshid Quli Jafar Khan]], was born a poor Deccani Oriya [[Brahmin]] before being sold into slavery and bought by one Haji Shafi Isfahani, a [[Persian people|Persian]] merchant from [[Isfahan]] who converted him to Islam. He entered the service of the [[Emperor Aurangzeb]] and rose through the ranks before becoming [[Nazim]] of Bengal in 1717, a post he held until his death in 1727. He in turn was succeeded by his grandson and son-in law until his grandson was killed in battle and succeeded by [[Alivardi Khan]] of the Afshar Dynasty in 1740.

The second dynasty, the Afshar, ruled from 1740 to 1757. They were succeeded by the third and final dynasty to rule Bengal, the Najafi, when Siraj Ud Daula, the last of the Afshar rulers was killed at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.  The Najafi ruled till 1880.

Nawab [[Alivardi Khan]] showed military skill during his wars with the [[Marathas]]. He completely routed the Marathas from Bengal. He crushed an uprising of the Afghans in Bihar and made the British pay 150,000 Tk for blocking Mughal and Armenian trade ships.

== Europeans in Bengal ==
[[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders and missionaries were the first Europeans to reach [[Bengal]] in the latter part of the 15th century. They were followed by representatives from the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], and the [[British East India Company]]. The Mughal [[Subahdar]] of Bengal Kasim Khan Mashadi completely destroyed the Portuguese forces in the [[Battle of Hoogly]] (1632). About 10,000 Portuguese men and women died in the battle and 4,400 were sent captive to Delhi.

During [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign, the local Nawab sold three villages, including one then known as [[Calcutta]], to the British. Calcutta was Britain's first foothold in Bengal and remained a focal point of their economic activity. The British gradually extended their commercial contacts and administrative control beyond Calcutta to the rest of Bengal. [[Job Charnock]] was one of the first dreamers of a British empire in Bengal. He waged war against the Mughal authority of Bengal which led to the Anglo-Mughal war for Bengal (1686–1690). [[Shaista Khan]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]], defeated the British in the battles of [[Hooghly district|Hoogly]] as well as [[Baleshwar]] and expelled the British from Bengal. Captain William Heath with a naval fleet moved towards [[Chittagong]] but it was a failure and he had to retreat to [[Madras]].

== British rule ==
[[Image:Bengalpresidency 1858.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Bengal Presidency]] of [[British India]] at its greatest extent in 1858.]]
The British East India Company gained official control of Bengal following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.  This was the first conquest, in a series of engagements that ultimately lead to the expulsion of other European competitors. The defeat of the Mughals and the consolidation of the subcontinent under the rule of a corporation was a unique event in imperialistic history. [[Kolkata]] (Anglicized as &quot;Calcutta&quot;) on the Hooghly became a major trading port for [[bamboo]], [[tea]], [[sugar cane]], [[spices]], [[cotton]], [[muslin]] and [[jute]] produced in [[Dhaka]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], and [[Kushtia]].

Scandals and the bloody rebellion known as the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] prompted the British government to intervene in the affairs of the [[East India Company]]. In 1858, authority in India was transferred from the Company to the crown, and the rebellion was brutally suppressed. Rule of India was organized under a [[Viceroy]] and continued a pattern of economic exploitation. Famine racked the subcontinent many times, including at least two major famines in Bengal. The [[British Raj]] was politically organized into seventeen provinces of which Bengal was one of the most significant. For a brief period in the early 20th century, an abortive attempt was made to [[East Bengal|divide Bengal]] into two zones, West Bengal and East Bengal &amp; Assam.

The [[Bengal Renaissance]] refers to a social reform movement during the nineteenth and early 20th centuries in Bengal during the period of [[British Raj|British rule]]. The [[Bengal]] renaissance can be said to have started with [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] (1775–1833)&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 211, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd. ISBN 81-7476-355-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941). Nineteenth century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from the 'medieval' to the 'modern'.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sarkar, &quot;Calcutta and the Bengal Renaissance&quot;, in ''[[Calcutta]], the Living City'' ed. Sukanta Chaudhuri, Vol I, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of Pakistan==
{{main|East Pakistan}}
As the independence movement throughout British-controlled India began in the late 19th century gained momentum during the 20th century, Bengali politicians played an active role in [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], exposing the opposing forces of ethnic and [[religious nationalism]]. By exploiting the latter, the British probably intended to distract the independence movement, for example by partitioning Bengal in 1905 along religious lines. The split only lasted for seven years.

At first the Muslim League sought only to ensure minority rights in the future nation. In 1940 the Muslim League passed the [[Lahore Resolution]] which envisaged one or more Muslim majority states in South Asia. Non-negotiable was the inclusion of the Muslim parts of Punjab and Bengal in these proposed states. The stakes grew as a new Viceroy [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] was appointed expressly for the purpose of effecting a graceful British exit. Communal violence in [[Noakhali]] and [[Calcutta]] sparked a surge in support for the Muslim League, which won a majority of Bengal's Muslim seats in the 1946 election. Accusations have been made that Hindu and Muslim nationalist instigators were involved in the latter incident.  At the last moment [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] came up with the idea of an independent and unified Bengal state, which was endorsed by Jinnah.  This idea was vetoed by the [[Indian National Congress]].

British India was partitioned and the independent states of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] were created in 1947; the region of Bengal was divided along religious lines. The predominantly Muslim eastern half of Bengal became the [[East Bengal]] (later renamed [[East Pakistan]]) state of Pakistan and the predominantly Hindu western part became the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].

Pakistan's history from 1947 to 1971 was marked by political instability and economic difficulties. In 1956 a constitution was at last adopted, making the country an &quot;Islamic republic within the Commonwealth&quot;. The nascent democratic institutions foundered in the face of military intervention in 1958, and the government imposed martial law between 1958 and 1962, and again between 1969 and 1971.

Almost from the advent of independent Pakistan in 1947, frictions developed between East and West Pakistan, which were separated by more than 1,000 miles of Indian territory. East Pakistanis felt exploited by the West Pakistan-dominated central government. Linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences also contributed to the estrangement of East from West Pakistan.

==The Bengali Language Movement==
{{main|Bengali Language Movement}}
[[Image:LM1952.jpg|thumb|250px|Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in [[Dhaka]]]]
The '''Bengali Language Movement''', also known as the '''Language Movement'''  ''Bhasha Andolon'', was a political effort in [[Bangladesh]] (then known as [[East Pakistan]]), advocating the recognition of the [[Bengali language]] as an [[official language]] of [[Pakistan]]. Such recognition would allow Bengali to be used in government affairs.

When the state of Pakistan was [[Partition of India|formed]] in 1947, its two regions, East Pakistan (also called [[East Bengal]]) and [[West Pakistan]], were split along cultural, geographical, and linguistic lines. In 1948, the [[Government of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Pakistan. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest led by the [[Awami Muslim League]], later renamed the [[Awami League]]. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956. In 2000, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February [[International Mother Language Day]] for the whole world to celebrate,&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, Henry and Mahmud, Feroz.2008.Living Traditions. Cultural Survey of Bangladesh Series-II. Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Dhaka. p.578&lt;/ref&gt; in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the [[6 Point Movement|6-point movement]] and subsequently the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. In Bangladesh, 21 February is observed as ''[[Language Movement Day]]'', a national holiday. The [[Shaheed Minar]] monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims.

==Politics: 1954–1970==
{{main|History of Bangladesh (1947–1971)}}
Great differences began developing between the two wings of Pakistan. While the west had a minority share of Pakistan's total population, it had the largest share of revenue allocation, industrial development, agricultural reforms and civil development projects. Pakistan's military and civil services were dominated by the fair-skinned, Persian-cultured [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Pashtun people|Afghans]]. Only one regiment in the Pakistani Army was Bengali. And many Bengali Pakistanis could not share the natural enthusiasm for the [[Kashmir]] issue, which they felt was leaving East Pakistan more vulnerable and threatened as a result.

==Independence==
{{main|Bangladesh Liberation War}}
[[Image:Bangladesh 1971 Liberation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Illustration showing military units and troop movements during the war.]]
After the Awami League won all the East Pakistan seats of the Pakistan's National Assembly in the 1970-71 elections, West Pakistan opened talks with the East on constitutional questions about the division of power between the central government and the provinces, as well as the formation of a national government headed by the Awami League.

The talks proved unsuccessful, however, and on March 1, 1971, Pakistani President [[Yahya Khan]] indefinitely postponed the pending National Assembly session, precipitating massive civil disobedience in East Pakistan.

On March 2, 1971, a group of students, led by '''A S M Abdur Rob''', student leader &amp; VP of DUCSU (Dhaka University Central Students Union) raised the new (proposed) flag of Bangladesh under the direction of '''Swadhin Bangla Nucleus'''.

On March 3, 1971, student leader Sahjahan Siraj read the Sadhinotar Ishtehar (Declaration of independence) at Paltan Maidan in front of Bangabandhu Shaikh Mujib along with student and public gathering under the direction of '''Swadhin Bangla Nucleus'''

On March 7, there was a historical public gathering in Paltan Maidan to hear the guideline for the revolution and independence from Shaikh Mujib, the frontier leader of movement that time. Although he avoided the direct speech of independence as the talks were still underway, he influenced the mob to prepare for the separation war. The speech is still considered a key moment in the war of liberation, and is remembered for the phrase, &quot;Ebarer Shongram Muktir Shongram, Ebarer Shongram Shadhinotar Shongram....&quot; (&quot;This time, the revolution is for freedom; this time, the revolution is for liberation....&quot;).

==Formal Declaration of Independence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mukti bahini.jpg|thumb|250pix|a muktiubahini training camp]] --&gt;
After the military crackdown by the Pakistan army began during the early hours of March 26, 1971 '''Bangabandhu''' [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was arrested and the political leaders dispersed, mostly fleeing to neighbouring India where they organized a provisional government afterwards. Before being held up by the Pakistani Army Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gave a hand note of the declaration of the independence of Bangladesh and it was circulated amongst people and transmitted by the then East Pakistan Rifles' wireless transmitter. Bengali Army Major Zia-Ur-Rahman captured Kalurghat Radio Station in Chittagong and read the declaration of independence of Bangladesh. 

&quot;I, Major Zia-ur-Rahman, do hereby proclaim the independence of Bangladesh.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh]] was formed in Meherpur,  (later renamed as [[Mujibnagar]] a place adjacent to the Indian border). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was announced to be the head of the state. [[Tajuddin Ahmed]] became the prime minister of the government. There the war plan was sketched with armed forces established named &quot;Muktibahini&quot; (freedom fighters). [[M. A. G. Osmani]] was assigned as the Chief of the force. The land sketched into 11 sectors under 11 sector commanders. Along with this sectors on the later part of the war Three special forces were formed namely Z Force, S Force and K Force. These three forces name were derived from the initial letter of the commandar's name. The training and most of the arms and ammunitions were arranged by the Meherpur government which were supported by India. As fighting grew between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali [[Mukti Bahini]], an estimated ten million Bengalis, mainly Hindus, sought refuge in the Indian states of [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[West Bengal]].

The crisis in East Pakistan produced new strains in Pakistan's troubled relations with India. The two nations had fought a war in 1965, mainly in the west, but the pressure of millions of refugees escaping into India in autumn of 1971 as well as [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Pakistani aggression]] reignited hostilities with Pakistan. Indian sympathies lay with East Pakistan, and on December 3, 1971, India intervened on the side of the Bangladeshis.

==Surrender and aftermath==
[[Image:InstrumentOfSurrender.jpg|thumb|right|Indian Lt. Gen J.S. Aurora and Pakistani Lt. Gen A.A.K. Niazi's signatures on the Instrument of Surrender.]]

On 16 December 1971, Lt. Gen [[A. A. K. Niazi]], [[Commanding Officer|CO]] of Pakistan Army forces located in East Pakistan signed the [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|Instrument of Surrender]] and the nation of ''Bangla Desh'' (&quot;Country of Bengal&quot;) was finally established the following day. At the time of surrender only a few countries had provided [[diplomatic recognition]] to the new nation. Over 90,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian forces making it the largest surrender since [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes1912005&quot; &gt;{{cite news|title=54 Indian PoWs of 1971 war still in Pakistan|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_19-1-2005_pg7_28|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=DailyTimes|date=Wednesday, January 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1971&gt;{{cite news|title=The 1971 war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new country changed its name to Bangladesh on January 11, 1972 and became a parliamentary democracy under a constitution. Shortly thereafter on March 19 Bangladesh signed a friendship treaty with India.Bangladesh sought admission in the UN with most voting in its favour, but China vetoed this as Pakistan was its key ally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1972/1972-1-9.htm Section 9. Situation in the Indian Subcontinent, 2. Bangladesh's international position] – [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, also a key ally of Pakistan, was one of the last nations to accord Bangladesh recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue332/guess.htmGuess who's coming to dinner] Naeem Bangali&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure a smooth transition, in 1972 the [[Simla Agreement]] was signed between India and Pakistan. The treaty ensured that Pakistan recognised the independence of Bangladesh in exchange for the return of the Pakistani PoWs. India treated all the PoWs in strict accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacw.net/article524.html |title=Bangladesh: Unfinished Justice for the crimes of 1971 – South Asia Citizens Web|publisher=Sacw.net |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It released more than 93,000 Pakistani PoWs in five months.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes1912005&quot;/&gt;

Further, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for [[war crime]]s by Bengalis were also pardoned by India. The accord also gave back more than {{convert|13000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few strategic areas;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A109&amp;Pg=6 |title=The Simla Agreement 1972 – Story of Pakistan |publisher=Storyofpakistan.com |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Kargil district|Kargil]] (which would in turn again be the focal point for [[Kargil War|a war]]between the two nations in 1999). This was done as a measure of promoting &quot;lasting peace&quot; and was acknowledged by many observers as a sign of maturity by India. But some in India felt that the treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile democracy in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis.
