      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71767">{{Culture of New Zealand}}
The '''history of [[New Zealand]]''' dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by [[Polynesia]]ns, who developed a distinct [[Māori culture]] centred on kinship links and land. The first European explorer to discover New Zealand was [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] on 13 December 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/2 | title=European discovery of New Zealand&amp;nbsp;— Abel Tasman | first=John | last=Wilson | work=Te Ara&amp;nbsp;— the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] / Te Manatū Taonga | location=New Zealand | accessdate=2010-01-16 | quote='On 13 December 1642 the Dutch sighted &quot;a large land, uplifted high&quot;&amp;nbsp;– probably the Southern Alps&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[James Cook]], who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages,&lt;ref&gt;Cook's Journal, 7 October 1769, [[National Library of Australia]], http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17691007.html, visited 20120409&lt;/ref&gt; was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand.

From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed between the [[British Crown]] and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the [[British Empire]] and giving Māori equal rights with British citizens. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to [[Pākehā]] (European) ownership, and most Māori subsequently became impoverished.

From the 1890s the [[New Zealand parliament]] enacted a number of progressive initiatives, including [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage]] and [[old age pensions]]. From the 1930s the economy was highly regulated and an extensive [[welfare state]] was developed. Meanwhile, Māori culture underwent a renaissance, and from the 1950s Māori began moving to the cities in large numbers. This led to the development of a [[Māori protest movement]] which in turn led to greater recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi in the late 20th century. In the 1980s the economy was largely deregulated and a number of socially liberal policies, such as decriminalisation of homosexuality, were put in place. [[Foreign relations of New Zealand|Foreign policy]] involved support for Britain in the world wars, and close relations after 1940 with the United States and Australia. Foreign policy after 1980 became more independent especially in pushing for a nuclear-free region. Subsequent governments have generally maintained these policies, although tempering the free market ethos somewhat.

==Polynesian foundation==
[[File:Famille Maori 1998-1361-139.jpg|thumb|280px|left|alt=Māori whānau from [[Rotorua]] in the 1880s|Māori whānau from Rotorua in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into Māori society during the 19th century.]]
New Zealand was originally settled by [[Polynesians]] from [[Eastern Polynesia]]. The most current reliable evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE. Previous dating of some [[Kiore| Kiore (Polynesian rat)]] bones at 50 - 150 CE has now been shown to have been unreliable; new samples of bone (and now also of unequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases) match the 1280 CE date of the earliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained, anthropogenic deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=David J. |title=Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and the impacts of volcanism on early Maori society: an update |url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/10289/2690/1/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-18 |isbn=978-0-473-14476-0 |journal=Guidebook for Pre-conference North Island Field Trip A1 'Ashes and Issues' |year=2008 |month=November |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descendants of these settlers became known as the [[Māori people|Māori]], forming a distinct culture of their own. The separate settlement of the tiny [[Chatham Islands]] in the east of New Zealand about 1500 CE produced the [[Moriori people]]; linguistic evidence indicates that the Moriori were mainland Māori who ventured eastward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moriori and Māori: The Linguistic Evidence|last=Clark|first=Ross|year=1994|publisher=[[Auckland University Press]]|location=Auckland, NZ|isbn= |pages=123–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original settlers quickly exploited the abundant large game in New Zealand, such as [[moa]], large [[flightless bird|flightless]] [[ratite]]s  that were pushed to [[extinction]] by about 1500. As moa and other large game became scarce or extinct, Māori culture underwent major change, with regional differences. In areas where it was possible to grow [[taro]] and [[Sweet potato|kūmara]], [[horticulture]] became more important. In the south of the South Island, however elsewhere wild plants such as [[fernroot]] were often available for harvest and cabbage trees were harvested and cultivated for food. Warfare also increased in importance, reflecting increased competition for land and other resources. In this period, fortified [[Pa (Maori)|pā]] became more common, although there is debate about the actual frequency of warfare. As elsewhere in the Pacific, [[cannibalism]] was part of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Making Peoples: A History of the New Zealanders from the Polynesian Settlement to the End of the Nineteenth Century|last=Belich|first=James|authorlink=James Belich (historian)|isbn=0-14-100639-0|pages=504|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership was based on a system of chieftainship, which was often but not always hereditary, although chiefs (male or female) needed to demonstrate leadership abilities to avoid being superseded by more dynamic individuals. The most important units of pre-European Māori society were the [[whānau]] or extended family, and the [[hapū]] or group of whānau. After these came the [[iwi]] or tribe, consisting of groups of hapū. Related hapū would often trade goods and co-operate on major projects, but conflict between hapū was also relatively common. Traditional Māori society preserved history [[oral history|orally]] through narratives, songs, and chants; skilled experts could recite the tribal genealogies (''[[whakapapa]]'') back for hundreds of years. Arts included whaikōrero ([[Public speaking|oratory]]), song composition in multiple genres, dance forms including [[haka]], as well as weaving, highly developed wood carving, and [[tā moko]] (tattoo).

Birds, fish and sea mammals were important sources of protein{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand has no native mammals, apart from some rare bats.&lt;/ref&gt;  Māori cultivated food plants which they had brought with them from Polynesia, including [[sweet potatoes]] (called kūmara), [[taro]], [[gourds]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They also cultivated the [[Cabbage tree (Cordyline australis)|cabbage tree]], a plant endemic to New Zealand, and exploited wild foods such as fern root, which provided a starchy paste.

==Early contact period==

===Explorers and other visitors===
[[Image:Tasmanmap1644.jpg|thumb|250px|The Abel Tasman map 1644, also known as the Bonaparte Tasman map that is part of the collection of the [[State Library of New South Wales]], Australia.]]
[[Image:Cook new zealand.jpg|thumb|right|First map of New Zealand, drawn by Captain [[James Cook]].]]
The first Europeans known to reach New Zealand were the crew of Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] who arrived in his ships ''Heemskerck'' and ''Zeehaen''. Tasman anchored at the northern end of the [[South Island]] in [[Golden Bay]] (he named it Murderers' Bay) in December 1642 and sailed northward to [[Tonga]] following a clash with local Māori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called them ''Staten Landt'', after the ''[[States-General of the Netherlands]]'', and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. Dutch cartographers changed the name to ''Nova Zeelandia'' in Latin, from ''Nieuw Zeeland'', after the [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch province]] of ''[[Zeeland]]''. It was subsequently Anglicised as ''New Zealand'' by British naval captain [[James Cook]] of [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] who [[First voyage of James Cook|visited]] the islands more than 100 years after Tasman during 1769–1770. Cook returned to New Zealand on both of his subsequent voyages. Various claims have been made that New Zealand was reached by other non-Polynesian voyagers before Tasman, but these are not widely accepted. Peter Trickett, for example, argues in ''[[Beyond Capricorn]]'' that the Portuguese explorer [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|reached New Zealand]] in the 1520s.

From the 1790s, the waters around New Zealand were visited by British, French and American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]] and trading ships. Their crews traded European goods, including guns and metal tools, for Māori food, water, wood, [[New Zealand flax|flax]] and [[prostitution|sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|last=King|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael King| isbn=0-14-301867-1|pages=122| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Māori were reputed to be enthusiastic and canny traders. Although there were some conflicts, such as the killing of French explorer [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]] and the [[Boyd massacre|destruction of the ''Boyd'']], most contact between Māori and European was peaceful. From the 19th century [[missionaries]] began settling in New Zealand and attempting to [[religious conversion|convert]] Māori to Christianity and control the considerably [[law]]less European visitors.

===Māori response===
The effect of contact on Māori varied. In some inland areas life went on more or less unchanged, although a European metal tool such as a fish-hook or hand axe might be acquired through trade with other tribes. At the other end of the scale, tribes that frequently encountered Europeans, such as [[Ngā Puhi]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]], underwent major changes.

Pre-European Māori had no distance weapons except for [[Tao (spear)|tao]] (spears)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nma.gov.au/cook/artefact.php?id=156| title=Spear tao kaniwha, spear tao huata, spears tao| work=Cook's Pacific Encounters: Cook-Forster collection| publisher=National Museum of Australia| location=Australia| accessdate=2009-12-13| quote='...Maori weapons were generally used in close combat, and the various types of clubs....'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the [[musket]] had an enormous impact on Māori warfare. Tribes with muskets would attack tribes without them, killing or enslaving many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/musket-wars/beginnings |title=Musket Wars - Beginnings - Hongi Hika: Warrior chief |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, guns became very valuable and Māori would trade huge quantities of goods for a single musket. The [[Musket Wars]] died out in the 1830s after most tribes had acquired muskets and a new balance of power was achieved. In 1835, the peaceful [[Moriori]] of the [[Chatham Islands]] were attacked, enslaved, and nearly exterminated by mainland [[Ngāti Mutunga]] and [[Ngāti Tama]] Māori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/moriori/4 | title =Moriori&amp;nbsp;— The impact of new arrivals | author = Denise Davis | coauthors =Māui Solomon | date =2009-03-04 | publisher =Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga | location =New Zealand | accessdate =2010-01-16 | quote ='..The annihilation of Moriori. Although the total number of Moriori first slaughtered was said to be around 300, hundreds more were enslaved and later died..' }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1901 census, only 35 Moriori were recorded although the numbers subsequently increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/moriori/6 | title =Moriori&amp;nbsp;— Facts and figures | author = Denise Davis | coauthors =Māui Solomon | date =2009-03-04 | publisher =Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga | location =New Zealand | accessdate =2010-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, many Māori converted to [[Christianity]]. The reasons for this have been hotly debated, and may include social and cultural disruption caused by the Musket Wars and European contact. Other factors may have been the appeal of a [[religion]] that promotes peace and forgiveness, a desire to emulate the Europeans and to gain a similar abundance of material goods, and the Māori's [[polytheistic]] culture that easily accepted the new God.

===European settlement===
European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. The first full-blooded European infant in the territory, Thomas King, was born in 1815 in the [[Bay of Islands]]. [[Kerikeri]], founded in 1822, and [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]] founded in 1823, both claim to be the oldest European settlements in New Zealand.

Many Europeans bought land from Māori, but misunderstanding and different concepts of land ownership led to conflict and bitterness. In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. This alarmed the missionaries, who called for British control of European settlers in New Zealand.

==British sovereignty==
In 1788 the colony of [[New South Wales]] had been founded.  According to Captain Phillip's amended Commission, dated 25 April 1787, the colony included ''all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean within the latitudes of 10°37'S and 43°39'S '' which included most of New Zealand except for the southern half of the South Island. In 1825 with [[Van Diemen's Land]] becoming a separate colony, the southern boundary of New South Wales was altered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/nsw6_doc_1825.pdf | title =Governor Darling's Commission 1825 (UK) | year =1825 | work = Documenting A Democracy, New South Wales Documents | publisher =National Archives of Australia | location =Australia | format =PDF | accessdate =2010-01-16 | quote ='...over our Territory called New South Wales extending from the Northern Cape or extremity of the Coast called Cape York in the latitude...' }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean with a southern boundary of 39°12'S which included only the northern half of the North Island. However, these boundaries had no real impact as the New South Wales administration had little interest in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the British ''New South Wales Judicature Act 1823'' made specific provision for administration of justice by the New South Wales Courts; stating &quot;And be it further enacted that the said supreme courts in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land respectively shall and may inquire of hear and determine all treasons piracies felonies robberies murders conspiracies and other offences of what nature or kind soever committed or that shall be committed upon the sea or in any haven river creek or place where the admiral or admirals have power authority or jurisdiction or committed or that shall be committed in the islands of New Zealand&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to complaints about lawless white sailors and adventurers in New Zealand, the [[British government]] appointed [[James Busby]] as Official Resident in 1832. In 1834 he encouraged Māori chiefs to assert their sovereignty with the signing of the ''[[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|Declaration of Independence]]'' in 1835. This was acknowledged by King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. Busby was provided with neither legal authority nor military support and was thus ineffective in controlling the European population.

===Treaty of Waitangi===
{{Main|Treaty of Waitangi}}
In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand. This, and the continuing lawlessness of many of the established settlers, spurred the British to take stronger action. Captain [[William Hobson]] was sent to New Zealand to persuade Māori to cede their [[sovereignty]] to the [[British Crown]]. In reaction to the New Zealand Company's moves, on 15 June 1839 a new Letters patent was issued to expand the territory of New South Wales to include all of New Zealand. [[Governor of New South Wales]] [[George Gipps]] was appointed Governor over New Zealand. This was the first clear expression of British intent to annex New Zealand.

On 6 February 1840, Hobson and about forty Māori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] in the [[Bay of Islands]]. Copies of the Treaty were subsequently taken around the country to be signed by other chiefs. A significant number refused to sign or were not asked but, in total, more than five hundred Māori eventually signed.

The Treaty gave Māori sovereignty over their lands and possessions and all of the rights of British citizens. What it gave the British in return depends on the language-version of the Treaty that is referred to. The English version can be said to give the British Crown sovereignty over New Zealand but in the Māori version the Crown receives ''kawanatanga'', which, arguably, is a lesser power (see [[Treaty of Waitangi#Meaning and interpretation|interpretations of the Treaty]]). Dispute over the true meaning and the intent of either party remains an issue.

Britain was motivated by the desire to forestall other European powers (France established a very small settlement at [[Akaroa]] in the [[South Island]] later in 1840), to facilitate settlement by British subjects and, possibly, to end the lawlessness of European (predominantly British and American) whalers, sealers and traders. Officials and missionaries had their own positions and reputations to protect.

Māori chiefs were motivated by a desire for protection from foreign powers, the establishment of governorship over European settlers and traders in New Zealand, and to allow for wider settlement that would increase trade and prosperity for Māori.&lt;ref name=motivation&gt;{{cite web |title=Making the Treaty |work=The Story of the Treaty |publisher=History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/node/2242 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobson died in September 1842. [[Robert FitzRoy]], the new governor, took some legal steps to recognise Māori custom. However, his successor, [[George Grey]], promoted rapid [[cultural assimilation]] and reduction of the land ownership, influence and rights of the Māori. The practical effect of the Treaty was, in the beginning, only gradually felt, especially in predominantly Māori regions.

==Colonial period==
The European population of New Zealand grew explosively from fewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500,000 by 1881. Some 400,000 settlers came from Britain, of whom 300,000 stayed permanently. Most were young people and 250,000 babies were born. The passage of 120,000 was paid by the colonial government. After 1880 immigration slacked off and growth was due chiefly to the excess of births over deaths.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, ''Making Peoples'' (1996) 278-80&lt;/ref&gt;   

Administered at first as a part of the Australian colony of [[New South Wales]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand became a colony in its own right]] on 1 July 1841. It was divided into three [[provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] that were reorganised in 1846 and in 1853, when they acquired their own legislatures, and then abolished in 1876. The country rapidly gained some measure of self-government through the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], which established central and provincial government. 

The Maori tribes at first sold the land to the settlers, but the government voided the sales in 1840. Now only the government was allowed to purchase land from the Maori, who received cash. The government bought practically all the useful land, then resold it to the [[New Zealand Company]], which promoted immigration, or leased it for sheep runs. The Company resold the best tracts to British settlers; its profits were used to pay the travel of the immigrants from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Condliffe, ''New Zealand in the Making: A Study of Economic and Social Development'' (2nd ed. 1959) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Banner, &quot;Conquest by Contract: Wealth Transfer and Land Market Structure in Colonial New Zealand,&quot; ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (2000) 34#1 pp. 47-96&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the vast distances involved, the first settlers were self-sufficient farmers. By the 1840s, however, large scale sheep ranches were exporting large quantities of wool to the textile mills of England. Most of the first settlers were brought over by a programme operated by the [[New Zealand Company]] (inspired by [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]) and were located in the central region on either side of Cook Strait, and at Wellington, Wanganui, New Plymouth and Nelson. These settlements had access to some of the richest plains in the country and after refrigerated ships appeared in 1882, they developed into closely settled regions of small-scale farming. Outside these compact settlements were the sheep runs. Pioneer pastoralists, often men with experience as squatters in Australia, leased lands from the government at the annual rate of £5 plus £1 for each 1,000 sheep above the first 5,000. The leases were renewed automatically, which gave the wealthy pastoralists a strong landed interest and made them a powerful political force.  In all between 1856 and 1876, 8.1 million acres were sold for £7.6 million, and 2.2 million acres were given free to soldiers, sailors and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Condliffe, ''New Zealand in the Making: A Study of Economic and Social Development'' (2nd ed. 1957) pp 20-21, 28, 113-18&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gold discoveries in Otago (1861) and Westland (1865), caused a worldwide gold rush that more doubled the population in a short period, from 71,000 in 1859 to 164,000 in 1863. The value of trade increased fivefold from £2 million to £10 million. As the gold boom ended Premier [[Julius Vogel]] borrowed money from British investors and launched in 1870 an ambitious programme of public works and infrastructure investment, together with a policy of assisted immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Raewyn Dalziel, &quot;Vogel, Julius - Biography,&quot; ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand'' updated 4-Jul-2012 [http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/1v4/1  online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Successive governments expanded the program with offices across Britain that enticed settlers and gave them and their families one-way tickets.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawke, ''Making of New Zealand'' (2005) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wakefield's vision===
British writer [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] (1796-1862) exerted a far-reaching influence. His plans for systematic British colonization focused on a free labour system, in contrast to slavery that existed in the United States and convict labour in Australia. Inspired by evangelical religion and abolitionism, Wakefield's essays (1829 to 1849), condemned both slavery and indentured and convict labour, as immoral, unjust, and inefficient. Instead, he proposed a government sponsored system in which the price of farm land was set at a high enough level to prevent urban workers from easily purchasing it and thus leaving the labour market. His colonisation programs were over-elaborate and operated on a much smaller scale than he hoped for, but his ideas influenced law and culture, especially his vision for the colony as the embodiment of post-Enlightenment ideals, the notion of New Zealand as a model society, and the sense of fairness in employer-employee relations.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Olssen, &quot;Mr. Wakefield and New Zealand as an Experiment in Post-Enlightenment Experimental Practice,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1997) 31#2 pp 197-218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Henning, &quot;New Zealand: An Antipodean Exception to Master and Servant Rules,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (2007) 41#1 pp 62-82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
{{see also|Women's suffrage in New Zealand}}
Although norms of masculinity were dominant, strong minded women originated a feminist movement starting in the 1860s, well before women gained the right to vote in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Else, ed., ''Women Together A History of Women's Organizations in New Zealand'' (Wellington: Daphne Brasell, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Middle class women employed the media (especially newspapers) to communicate with each other and define their priorities. Prominent feminist writers included Mary Taylor,&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Hughes, &quot;Taylor, Mary&quot; in ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography'' (2010)  [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t21/1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Colclough (pseud.

Feminists by the 1880s were using the rhetoric of &quot;white slavery&quot; to reveal men's sexual and social oppression of women. By demanding that men take responsibility for the right of women to walk the streets in safety, New Zealand feminists deployed the rhetoric of white slavery to argue for women's sexual and social freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Dalley, &quot;'Fresh Attractions': White Slavery and Feminism in New Zealand, 1885-1918,&quot; ''Women's History Review'' (2000) 9#3 pp 585-606.&lt;/ref&gt; Middle class women successfully mobilized to stop prostitution, especially during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Dalley, &quot;Lolly Shops 'of the Red-Light Kind' and 'Soldiers of the King': Suppressing One-Woman Brothels in New Zealand, 1908-1916,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1996) 30#1 pp 3-23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maori women developed their own form of feminism, derived from Maori nationalism rather than European sources.&lt;ref&gt;Radhika Mohanram, &quot;The Construction of Place: Maori Feminism and Nationalism in Aotearoa/New Zealand,&quot; ''NWSA Journal'' (Spring 1996) 8#1 pp 50-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michele Dominy, &quot;Maori Sovereignty A Femimst Invention of Tradition,&quot; in ''Cultural Identity and Ethnicity in the Pacific,'' edited by Jocelyn Linnekin and Lin

In 1893 Elizabeth Yates was elected mayor of Onehunga; an able administrator she cut the debt, reorganised the fire brigade, and improved the roads and sanitation. Many men were hostile and she was defeated for reelection.&lt;ref&gt;By Janice C. Mogford, &quot;Yates, Elizabeth,&quot; ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography'' (2010) [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2y1/1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutching argues that after 1890 women were increasingly well organized through  the National Council of Women, the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), the Women's International League, and the Housewives Union, and others. By 1910 they were campaigning for peace, and against compulsory military training, and conscription. They demanded arbitration and the peaceful resolution of international disputes. The women argued that womenhood (thanks to motherhood) was the repository of superior moral values and concerns and from their domestic experience they knew best how to resolve conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Hutching, &quot;'Mothers Of The World': Women, Peace and Arbitration in Early Twentieth-Century New Zealand,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1993) 27#2 pp 173-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
{{main|History of education in New Zealand}}
Before 1877 numerous schools were operated by the provincial government or churches, or by private subscription. No one was required to attend and many children did not attend any school, especially farm children whose labour was important to the family economy. The quality of education varied widely amongst those providing it. The Education Act 1877 established New Zealand's first free national system of primary education.  It established standards of quality of education, and reduce the secular influence on education. It became compulsory for children from ages 5 to 15 to attend primary school.

===Immigration===

From 1840 there was considerable European settlement, primarily from England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland; and to a lesser extent the United States, India, and various parts of [[continental Europe]], including the province of [[Dalmatia]]&lt;ref&gt;Carl Walrond. 'Dalmatians', Te Ara—the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 26-Sep-2006, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Dalmatians/en&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now [[Croatia]], and [[Bohemia]]&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson. 'Central and South-eastern Europeans', Te Ara—the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 26-Sep-2006,
http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/CentralAndSouth-easternEuropeans/en&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now the Czech Republic. Already a majority of the population by 1859, the number of white settlers (called ''[[Pākehā]]'' by Māori) increased rapidly to reach a million by 1911.

In the 1870s and 1880s, several thousand Chinese men, mostly from [[Guangdong]] province, migrated to New Zealand to work on the South Island goldfields. Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the [[Otago]] Provincial government they quickly became the target of hostility from white settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Manying Ip. 'Chinese', Te Ara—the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21-Dec-2006, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Chinese/en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Māori adaptation and resistance===
Māori had welcomed Pākehā for the trading opportunities and guns they brought. However it soon became clear that they had underestimated the number of settlers that would arrive in their lands. ''[[Iwi]]'' (tribes) whose land was the base of the main settlements quickly lost much of their land and autonomy through government acts. Others prospered—until about 1860 the city of [[Auckland]] bought most of its food from Māori who grew and sold it themselves. Many ''iwi'' owned flour mills, ships and other items of European technology, some exported food to Australia. Although race relations were generally peaceful in this period, there were conflicts over who had ultimate power in particular areas—the Governor or the Māori chiefs. One such conflict was the Northern or [[Flagstaff War]] of the 1840s, during which the town of [[Kororareka]] was destroyed.

As the ''Pākehā'' population grew, pressure grew on Māori to sell more land. A few tribes had become nearly landless and others feared losing their lands. Land is not only an economic resource, but also the basis of Māori identity and a connection with their ancestors. Land was held communally, it was not given up without discussion and consultation—or loss during warfare.

''Pākehā'' had little understanding of all that and accused Māori of holding onto land they did not use efficiently. Competition for land was a primary cause of the [[New Zealand Land Wars]] of the 1860s and 1870s, in which the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] and [[Waikato]] regions were invaded by colonial troops and Māori of these regions had much of their land taken from them. The wars and confiscation left bitterness that remains to this day.

Some ''iwi'' sided with the government and, later, fought with the government. They were motivated partly by the thought that an alliance with the government would benefit them, and partly by old feuds with the ''iwi'' they fought against. One result of their co-operation strategy was the establishment of the four [[Māori seats]] in parliament, in 1867.

After the wars, some Māori began a strategy of [[passive resistance]], most famously at [[Parihaka]] in Taranaki. Others continued co-operating with ''Pākehā''. For example, tourism ventures were established by [[Te Arawa]] around [[Rotorua]]. Resisting and co-operating ''iwi'' both found that the ''Pākehā'' desire for land remained. In the last decades of the century, most ''iwi'' lost substantial amounts of land through the activities of the [[Native Land Court]]. This was set up to give Māori land ''European-style'' titles and to establish ''exactly'' who owned it. Due to its Eurocentric rules, the high fees, its location remote from the lands in question, and unfair practices by many Pākehā land agents, its main effect was to directly or indirectly separate Māori from their land.

The combination of war, confiscations, disease,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_37/rsnz_37_00_000660.html Epidemic Diseases (Papa reti or Mate uruta).], [[National Library of New Zealand]]&lt;/ref&gt; assimilation and intermarriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portdanielpress.com/maori_pop.htm|title=Estimating a population devastated by epidemics|last=Entwisle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Entwisle|publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; land loss leading to poor housing and alcohol abuse, and general disillusionment, caused a fall in the Māori population from around 86,000 in 1769 to around 70,000 in 1840 and around 48,000 by 1874, hitting a low point of 42,000 in 1896.&lt;ref name=population&gt;{{cite book |last=Belich |first=James |title=Making Peoples |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |year=1996 |location=Auckland |page=178 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently their numbers began to recover.

===South Island===
[[Image:NZ religious denominations.png|thumb|right|300px|The settlement of English in the North Island and northern South Island and Scottish in the Deep South is reflected in the dominance of Anglicanism and Presbyterianism in the respective regions.]]

While the North Island was convulsed by the Land Wars, the South Island, with its low Māori population, was generally peaceful. In 1861 gold was discovered at [[Gabriel's Gully]] in [[Central Otago]], sparking a [[Central Otago Gold Rush|gold rush]]. [[Dunedin]] became the wealthiest city in the country and many in the South Island resented financing the North Island’s wars. In 1865 Parliament defeated a proposal to make the South Island independent by 17 to 31.

The South Island contained most of the Pākehā population until around 1900 when the North Island again took the lead and has supported an ever greater majority of the country's total population through the 20th century and into the 21st.

Scottish immigrants dominated the South Island and evolved ways to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many local Caledonian societies were formed. They organized sports teams to entice the young and preserved an idealized Scottish national myth (based on [[Robert Burns]]) for the elderly. They gave Scots a path to assimilation and cultural integration as [[Scottish New Zealander]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tanja Bueltmann, &quot;'No Colonists are more Imbued with their National Sympathies than Scotchmen,'&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (2009) 43#2 pp 169-181 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1771&amp;action=null online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890-1914===

====Politics====
The prewar era saw the advent of [[party politics]], with the establishment of the [[First Liberal Government of New Zealand|First Liberal government]]. The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but it did have wealthy landowners who largely controlled politics before 1891.  The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called &quot;populism.&quot; [[Richard Seddon]]  had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: &quot;It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes.  That, Sir, shows  the  real political  position  of New Zealand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small land-owning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The First Liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state, with [[old age pensions]], developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893 it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to enact [[women's suffrage|universal female suffrage]]. 

To obtain land for farmers the Liberal government from  1891 to 1911  purchased 3.1 million acres of Maori land. The government also purchased 1.3 million acres from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act of  1894 provided low-interest mortgages, while the Agriculture Department disseminated information on the best farming methods.

The 1909 Native Land Act allowed the Maori to sell land to private buyers. By 1920 Maori still owned five million acres by 1920; they leased three million acres and used one million acres for themselves.  The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, antimonopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal party in rural North Island electorates.  By 1903 the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp 39-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Brooking, &quot;'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891-1911,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp 78-98 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&amp;action=null online]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand gained international attention for its reforms, especially how the state regulated labour relations.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Anderson and Michael Quinlan, &quot;The Changing Role of the State: Regulating Work in Australia and New Zealand 1788-2007,&quot; ''Labour History'' (2008), Issue 95, pp 111-132.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of special note were innovations in the areas of maximum hour regulations, minimum wage laws, and compulsory arbitration procedures. The goal was to encourage unions but discourage strikes and class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, ''Progressivism and the World of Reform: New Zealand and the Origins of the American Welfare State'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The impact was especially strong on the reform movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, &quot;New Zealand Liberalism and the Origins of the American Welfare State,&quot; ''Journal of American History'' (1982) 69#2 pp. 372-391 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1893824 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman argues that the Liberals in 1891 lacked a clearcut ideology to guide them. Instead they approached the nation's problems pragmatically, keeping in mind the constraints imposed by democratic public opinion. To deal with the issue of land distribution, they worked out innovative solutions to access, tenure, and a graduated tax on unimproved values.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, &quot;The New Zealand Welfare State: Origins and Reflections,&quot; ''Continuity'' (1981), Issue 2, pp 43-61&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
Major changes occurred during this decade. The economy grew from one based on wool and local trade to the export of wool, cheese, butter and frozen beef and mutton to Britain, a change enabled by the invention of refrigerated steamships in 1882. Refrigerated shipping remained the basis of [[Economy of New Zealand|New Zealand’s economy]] until the 1970s. New Zealand's highly productive agriculture gave it probably the world's highest standard of living, with fewer at the rich and poor ends of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Belich, ''Paradise Reforged'' p 44&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1880–1914 era the banking system was weak and there was little foreign investment, so businessmen had to build up their own capital. Historians have debated whether the &quot;long depression&quot; of the late 19th century stifled investment, but the New Zealanders found a way around adverse conditions.  Hunter has studied the experiences of 133 entrepreneurs who started commercial enterprises between 1880 and 1910. The successful strategy was to deploy capital economizing techniques, and reinvesting profits rather than borrowing. The result was slow but stable growth that avoided bubbles and led to long-lived family owned firms.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hunter, &quot;Making a little go further: Capital and the New Zealand entrepreneur,&quot; ''Business History'' (2007) 49#1 pp 52-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hunter, &quot;Risk, Persistence, and Focus: A Lifecycle of the Entrepreneur,&quot; ''Australian Economic History Review'' (2005) 45#3 pp 244–272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominion and Realm==
{{Main|Independence of New Zealand}}
[[Image:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|400px|Historical map of Australia and New Zealand, 1788-1911.]]
New Zealand initially expressed interest in joining the proposed Federation of the Australian colonies, attending the 1891 National Australia Convention in Sydney. Interest in the proposed Australian Federation faded and New Zealand decided against joining the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901, and instead changed from being a [[colony]] to a separate &quot;[[dominion]]&quot; in 1907, equal in status to Australia and Canada.

===Prohibition===
In New Zealand, [[prohibition]] was a moralistic reform movement begun in the mid-1880s by the Protestant evangelical and Nonconformist churches and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and after 1890 by the Prohibition League. It never achieved its goal of national prohibition. It was a middle-class movement which accepted the existing economic and social order; the effort to legislate morality assumed that individual redemption was all that was needed to carry the colony forward from a pioneering society to a more mature one. However, both the Church of England and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an intrusion of government into the church's domain, while the growing labour movement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy.  Reformers hoped that the women's vote, in which New Zealand was a pioneer, would swing the balance, but the women were not as well organized as in other countries. Prohibition had a majority in a national referendum in 1911, but needed a 60% majority to pass. The movement kept trying in the 1920s, losing three more referenda by close votes; it managed to keep in place a 6pm closing hour for pubs and Sunday closing.  The Depression and war years effectively ended the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Ryan, &quot;Drink and the historians: sober reflections on alcohol in New Zealand 1840–1914&quot;, ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (April 2010) Vol.44, No.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Newman, &quot;[http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1426&amp;action=null New Zealand's vote for prohibition in 1911]&quot;, ''New Zealand Journal of History,'' April 1975, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp 52-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{Main|Military history of New Zealand in World War I}}
The country remained an enthusiastic member of the [[British Empire]], and 100,000 men fought in [[World War I]] (see [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]). New Zealand forces took [[Western Samoa]] from Germany in the early stages of the war, and New Zealand administered the country until Samoan Independence in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Berriedale Keith|authorlink=A. Berriedale Keith|title=War government of the British dominions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VkO0AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Zealand&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=6#v=snippet&amp;q=Zealand&amp;f=false|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heroism of the soldiers in the failed Galipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and secured the psychological independence of the nation.

===1920s===
After the war New Zealand signed the Treaty of Versailles (1919) joined the [[League of Nations]] and pursued an independent foreign policy, while its defense was still controlled by Britain.  New Zealand depended on Britain's Royal Navy for its military security during the 1920s and 1930s. Officials in Wellington trusted Conservative Party governments in London, but not Labour. When the British Labour Party took power in 1924 and 1929, the New Zealand government felt threatened by Labour's foreign policy because of its reliance upon the League of Nations. The League was distrusted and Wellington did not expect to see the coming of a peaceful world order under League auspices. What had been the Empire's most loyal dominion became a dissenter as it opposed efforts the first and second British Labour governments to trust the League's framework of arbitration and collective security agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Chaudron, &quot;The League of Nations and Imperial Dissent: New Zealand and the British Labour Governments, 1924-31,&quot; ''Journal of Imperial &amp; Commonwealth History'' (March 2011) 39#1 pp 47-71&lt;/ref&gt;  

The governments of the Reform and United parties between 1912 and 1935 followed a &quot;realistic&quot; foreign policy. They made national security a high priority, were skeptical of international institutions, and showed no interest on the questions of self-determination, democracy, and human rights. However the opposition Labour Party was more idealistic and proposed a liberal internationalist outlook on international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. McCraw, &quot;The Zenith of Realism in New Zealand’s Foreign Policy,&quot; ''Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History'' (2002) 48#3 pp 353-368.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Labour Party emerged as a force in 1919 with a Socialist platform. Its won about 25% of the vote. However its appeals to working class solidarity were not effective because a large fraction of the working class voted for conservative candidates of the Liberal and Reform parties. (They merged in 1936 to form the National Party.) As a consequence the Labour party was able to jettison its support for socialism in 1927 (a policy made official in 1951), as it expanded its reach into middle class constituencies. The result was an jump in strength to 35% in 1931, 47% in 1935, and peaking at 56% in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Fairburn and Stephen Haslett, &quot;The Rise of the Left and Working-Class Voting Behavior in New Zealand: New Methods,&quot; ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (2005) 35#3 pp 523-555&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1935 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] showed a limited degree of idealism in foreign policy, for example opposing the appeasement of Germany and Japan.

===Depression===
Like most other countries, New Zealand was hard hit by the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, which affected the country via its international trade, with farming export drops then going on to affect the money supply and in turn consumption, investment and imports. The country was most affected around 1930-1932, when average farm incomes for a short time dipped below zero, and the unemployment rates peaked. Though actual unemployment numbers were not officially counted, the country was affected especially strongly in the North Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA79&quot;&gt;Malcolm McKinnon, ed., ''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' (David Bateman, 1997), Plate 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike later years, there were no public benefit ('dole') payments&amp;nbsp;— the unemployed were given 'relief work', much of which was however not very productive, partly because the size of the problem was unprecedented. Women also increasingly registered as unemployed, while Maori received government help through other channels such as the land development schemes organised by [[Apirana Ngata]]. In 1933, 8.5% of the unemployed were organised in work camps, while the rest received work close to their homes. Typical occupations in relief work were road work (undertaken by 45% of all part-time and 19% of all full-time relief workers in 1934, with park improvement works (17%) and farm work (31%) being the other two most common types of work for part-time and full-time relief workers respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA79&quot;/&gt;

====Labour in power====
{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}
Attempts by the conservative [[Liberal-Reform coalition]] to deal with the situation with spending cuts and relief work were ineffective and unpopular. In 1935, the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] was elected, and the post-depression decade showed that average Labour support in New Zealand had roughly doubled comparable to pre-depression times. By 1935 economic conditions had improved somewhat, and the new government had more positive financial conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA79&quot;/&gt; Savage proclaimed that, &quot;Social Justice must be the guiding principle and economic organization must adapt itself to social needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hackett Fischer|title=Fairness and Freedom:A History of Two Open Societies: New Zealand and the United States: A History of Two Open Societies: New Zealand and the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d3spp4c33xIC&amp;pg=PA368|year=2012|publisher=Oxford U.P. |page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government quickly set about implementing a number of significant reforms, including a reorganisation of the [[social welfare]] system and the creation of the [[state housing]] scheme. Labour also gained Maori votes by working closely with the [[Rātana]] movement. Savage was idolized by the working classes, and his portrait hung on the walls of many houses around the country. The newly created [[welfare state]] promised government support to individuals &quot;From the cradle to the grave,&quot; according to the Labour slogan It included free health care and education and state assistance for the elderly, infirm, and unemployed. The opposition attacked the Labour Party's more left-wing policies, and accused it of undermining free enterprise and hard work. The Reform Party and the United Party merged to become the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and would be Labour's main rival in future years. However the welfare state system was retained and expanded by successive National and Labour governments until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Gustafson, ''From the cradle to the grave: a biography of Michael Joseph Savage'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
{{Main|Military history of New Zealand in World War II}}
When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, New Zealanders saw their proper role as defending their proud place in the British Empire. It contributed some 120,000 troops. They mostly fought in Europe, relying on the [[Royal Navy]] and later the United States to protect New Zealand from the Japanese forces. Japan had no interest in New  Zealand in the first place; it had already overreached when it invaded New Guinea in 1942. (There were a few highly publicized but ineffective Japanese scouting incursions.)  The cooperation with the United States meanwhile set a direction of policy which resulted in the [[ANZUS]] Treaty between New Zealand, America and Australia in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hensley, ''Beyond the Battlefield: New Zealand and its Allies, 1939–45'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedorowich and Bridge argue that the demands of War produced long-term consequences the relationship with the government in London. The key component was the office of the high commissioner. By 1950 it was the main line of communications between the British and New Zealand governments.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Fedorowich and Carl Bridge, &quot;Family Matters? The Dominion High Commissioners in Wartime Britain, 1938–42,&quot; ''Journal of Imperial &amp; Commonwealth History'' (March 2012) 40#1 pp 1-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Montgomerie, &quot;The Limitations of Wartime Change: Women War Workers in New Zealand,&quot; ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1989) 23#1 pp 68-86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
Mainstream New Zealand culture was deeply British and conservative, with the concept of &quot;fairness&quot; holding a central role.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''Fairness and Freedom: A History of Two Open Societies: New Zealand and the United States'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1890s, the economy had been based almost entirely on the export of frozen meat and dairy products to Britain, and in 1961, the share of New Zealand exports going to the United Kingdom was still at slightly over 51%, with approximately 15% more going to other European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA100&quot;&gt;McKinnon, ed. ''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' - Plate 100&lt;/ref&gt; This system was irreparably damaged by Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, at a time of global economic upheaval regarding energy prices. Britain's accession to the European Community forced New Zealand to not only find new markets, but also re-examine its national identity and place in the world.

===Maori urbanisation===
Māori always had a high birth rate; that was neutralized by a high death rate until modern public health measures became effective in the 20th century when tuberculosis deaths and infant mortality declined sharply. Life expectancy grew from 49 years in 1926 to 60 years in 1961 and the total numbers grew rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ian Pool, &quot;Post-War Trends in Maori Population Growth,&quot; ''Population Studies'' (1967) 21#2 pp. 87-98 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2172713 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Māori served in the Second World War and learned how to cope in the modern urban world; others moved from their rural homes to the cities to take up jobs vacated by Pākehā servicemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA91&quot;&gt;McKinnon, ed. ''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' Plate 91&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to the cities was also caused by their strong birth rates in the early 20th century, with the existing rural farms in Māori ownership having increasing difficulty in providing enough jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHA91&quot;/&gt; Māori culture had meanwhile undergone a renaissance thanks in part to politician [[Apirana Ngata]]. World War II saw the beginning of a mass Māori migration to the cities, and by the 1980s 80% of the Māori population was urban, in contrast to only 20% before the war. The migration led to better pay, higher standards of living and longer schooling, but also exposed problems of [[racism]] and discrimination. By the late 1960s, a protest movement had emerged to combat racism, promote Māori culture and seek fulfilment of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Urbanisation proceeded rapidly across the land. In the late 1940s, town planners noted that the country was &quot;possibly the third most urbanised country in the world&quot;, with two thirds of the population living in cities or towns. There was also increasing concern that this trend was badly managed, with it being noted that there was an &quot;ill-defined urban pattern that appears to have few of the truly desirable urban qualities and yet manifests no compensating rural characteristics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Arc02_04DesR-t1-body-d4.html Urban Development] from a paper read to the New Zealand Branch, Town Planning Institute, 4 May 1949.

===The &quot;Muldoon years&quot;: 1975–1984===
The country's economy suffered in the aftermath of the 1973 global energy crisis, the loss of New Zealand's biggest export market upon Britain's entry to the [[European Economic Community]], and rampant inflation. [[Robert Muldoon]], Prime Minister from 1975 to 1984, and his [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National government]] responded to the crises of the 1970s by attempting to preserve the New Zealand of the 1950s. He attempted to maintain New Zealand's &quot;cradle to the grave&quot; welfare state, which dated to 1935. His government sought to give retirees 80% of the current wage, which would require large-scale borrowing; critics said it would bankrupt the treasury. Muldoon's response to the crisis also involved imposing a total freeze on wages, prices, interest rates and dividends across the national economy. His conservatism and antagonistic style exacerbated an atmosphere of conflict in New Zealand, most violently expressed during the [[1981 Springbok Tour]]. In the 1984 elections Labour promised to calm down the increasing tensions, while making no specific promises; it scored a landslide victory.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Gustafson, ''His Way: A Biography of Robert Muldoon'' (2000) ch 21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Muldoon's Government was not entirely backward looking. Some innovations did take place, for example the [[Closer Economic Relations]] (CER) free-trade programme with Australia to liberalise trade, starting in 1982. The aim of total free trade between the two countries was achieved in 1990, five years ahead of schedule. Also, in 1983 the term &quot;dominion&quot; was replaced with &quot;realm&quot; by letters patent.

===The radical 1980s reforms===
In 1984, the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour government]] was elected amid a [[New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984|constitutional and economic crisis]]. Unexpectedly, the Labour government between 1984-1990 launched a major policy of restructuring the economy radically reducing the role of government.&lt;ref&gt;Belich, ''Paradise reforged,'' pp 394-424&lt;/ref&gt;  A political scientist reports:
:&quot;Between  1984  and  1993,  New  Zealand  underwent  radical  economic  reform, moving from  what  had  probably  been  the  most  protected,  regulated and state-dominated system of any capitalist democracy to an extreme position at the open, competitive, free-market end of the spectrum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jack H. Nagel, &quot;Social Choice in a Pluralitarian Democracy: The Politics of Market Liberalization in New Zealand,&quot; ''British Journal of Political Science'' (1998) 28#2 pp. 223-267 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/194306 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms were led by finance minister [[Roger Douglas]] (finance minister (1984-1988), who enacted fundamental, radically neo-liberal and unexpectedly pro-free market reforms known as [[Rogernomics]]. This involved removing many of the favours and barriers that had long insulated the economy from world trends. It involved floating the [[New Zealand dollar]], cutting government spending, reducing most taxes and introducing a sales tax ([[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST]]), and removing most subsidies. Rogernomics resembled the contemporaneous policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;J. Boston, &quot;Thatcherism and Rogernomics: changing the rules of the game—comparisons and contrasts,&quot; ''Political Science'' (1987) 39#2 pp 129-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Rogernomics was a rapid programme of deregulation and public-asset sales. Subsidies were phased out to farmers and consumers. High finance was partly deregulated. Restrictions on foreign exchange were relaxed and the dollar was allowed to float and seek its natural level on the world market. The tax on high incomes was cut in half from 65% to 33%. The shares exchange entered a bubble, which then burst. Shares had a total value of $50 billion in 1987 and only $15 billion in 1991; Belich says that at one point the crash was  &quot;the worst in world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Belich p 407&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall the economic growth fell from 2% a year to 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Belich p 423&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strong criticism of Rogernomics came from the left, especially from Labour's traditional union and leftist support-base; Lange broke with Douglas's policies in 1987; both men were forced out and Labour was in confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Easton, ed., ''The Making of Rogernomics'' (Auckland University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fourth Labour government innovations included greater recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi through the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|Homosexual Law Reform]], the [[Constitution Act 1986]] and the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act|New Zealand Bill of Rights]].

The Fourth Labour Government also revolutionised New Zealand's foreign policy, making the country a [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|nuclear-free zone]] and effectively leaving the ANZUS alliance. Immigration policy was liberalised, allowing an influx of immigrants from Asia. Previously most immigrants to New Zealand had been European and especially British, apart from some migrants from other Pacific Islands such as [[Samoa]].

====Continuing reform under National====
Voters unhappy with the rapid speed and far-reaching extent of reforms elected a [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|National government]] in 1990, led by [[Jim Bolger]]. However the new government continued the economic reforms of the previous Labour government, in what was known as [[Ruthanasia]]. Unhappy with what seemed to be a pattern of governments failing to reflect the mood of the electorate, New Zealanders in 1992 and 1993 voted to [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|change the electoral system]] to [[Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP), a form of [[proportional representation]]. New Zealand's [[New Zealand general election, 1996|first MMP election]] was held in 1996. Following the election National was returned to power in coalition with the [[New Zealand First]] Party.

With the end of the Cold War in 1991, the nation's foreign policy turned increasingly to issues of its nuclear-free status and other military issues; its adjustment to neoliberalism in international trade relations; and its involvement in humanitarian, environmental, and other matters of international diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. Buchanan, &quot;Lilliputian in Fluid Times: New Zealand Foreign Policy after the Cold War,&quot; ''Political Science Quarterly'' (2010) 125#2 pp 255-279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David J. McCraw, &quot;New Zealand's Foreign Policy Under National and Labour Governments: Variations on the 'Small State' Theme?&quot; ''Pacific Affairs'' (1994) 67#1 pp. 7-25 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2760117 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour government]] led by [[Helen Clark]] was elected in [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999]]. It maintained most of the previous governments' economic reforms&amp;nbsp;— restricting government intervention in the economy much more so than previous governments&amp;nbsp;— while putting more of an emphasis on social policy and outcomes. For example, employment law was modified to give more protection to workers, and the [[student loan]] system was changed to eliminate interest payments for New Zealand resident students and graduates. Helen Clark's Labour government remained in power for nine years before being replaced in 2008 by New Zealand's [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National government]] led by [[John Key]].

New Zealand retains strong but informal links to Britain, with many young New Zealanders travelling to Britain for their &quot;OE&quot; ([[overseas experience]]) due to favourable working visa arrangements with Britain. Despite New Zealand's immigration liberalisation in the 1980s, Britons are still the largest group of migrants to New Zealand, due in part to recent immigration law changes which privilege fluent speakers of English. A few constitutional links to Britain remain&amp;nbsp;— the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|New Zealand Sovereign]] is a British resident, for example. However, British imperial honours were discontinued in 1996, the Governor-General has taken a more active role in representing New Zealand overseas, and appeals from the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] were replaced by a local [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]] in 2003. From time to time there is public debate about whether New Zealand should become a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|republic]], and public sentiment is divided on the issue.

Foreign policy has been essentially independent since the mid 1980s. Under Labour Prime Minister Clark, 2000-2008, foreign policy reflected the priorities of liberal internationalism. She stressed the promotion of democracy and human rights; the strengthening of the role of the United Nations; the advancement of antimilitarism and disarmament; and the encouragement of free trade.&lt;ref&gt;David McCraw, &quot;New Zealand Foreign Policy Under the Clark Government: High Tide of Liberal Internationalism?,&quot; ''Pacific Affairs'' (2005) 78#2 pp 217-235 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/40023914 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; She sent troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan War]], but did not contribute combat troops to the [[Iraq War]] although some medical and engineering units were sent.  

[[John Key]] led the National Party to victory in both the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|November 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Levine and Nigel S. Roberts, eds. ''Key to Victory: The New Zealand General Election of 2008'' (Victoria U.P, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|November 2011 general elections]]. Key leads the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]] which entered government at the beginning of the [[2008–2012 global recession|late-2000s recession]] in 2008. In his first term, Key's government implemented a [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST rise]] and personal tax cuts. In February 2011, a [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake|major earthquake in Christchurch]], the nation's second largest city, significantly impacted the national economy and the government formed the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of state-owned assets. In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of [[New Zealand Defence Force]] personnel [[International Security Assistance_Force#Non-NATO and non-EAPC nations|from their deployment]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|war in Afghanistan]], signed the [[New Zealand-United States relations#Wellington Declaration|Wellington Declaration]] with the [[United States]] and pushed for more nations to join the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]].

[[Tourism in New Zealand|Tourism]] and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]] are now the major industries that contribute to [[Economy of New Zealand|New Zealand's economy]]. The traditional agricultural products of meat, dairy and wool has been supplemented by other products such as fruit, wine and timber.
