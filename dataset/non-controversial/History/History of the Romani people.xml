      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34325">{{Romani people}}
The [[Romani people]], also referred to depending on the sub-group as '''Roma''', '''Sinti''', '''Kale''', '''Romani''' or '''Gypsies''', are an [[ethnic group]] who live primarily in [[Europe]]. They are believed to have originated in region of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in [[South Asia]]. They began their migration to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] via the [[Iranian plateau]] about 1,000 years ago. 

The reason for their [[diaspora]] remains unknown.

==Origin==
[[File:Spiezer Schilling 749.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First arrival of Gypsies outside [[Bern]] in the 15th century, described by the chronicler as ''getoufte heiden'' &quot;baptized heathens&quot; and drawn wearing Saracene style clothes and weapons ([[Spiezer Schilling]], p. 749).]]

The absence of a written history has meant that the origin and early history of the Romani people was long an enigma. Part of Indian origin was suggested on linguistic grounds as  early as 200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory suggests that the name ultimately derives from a form ''[[Domba|ḍōmba]]-'' 'man of low caste living by singing and music', attested in Classical Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ralph L. Turner, ''A comparative dictionary of the Indo-Aryan languages'', p. 314. London: Oxford University Press, 1962-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic evidence indicates the Romanies originated from the [[Rajasthani people]], emigrating from India towards the northwest no earlier than the 11th century but it still remains uncertain. Contemporary populations sometimes suggested as sharing a close relationship to the Romani are the [[Dom people]] of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Banjara]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ian|last=Hancock|title=Ame Sam e Rromane Džene/We are the Romani people|page=13|isbn=1-902806-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a limited medical survey of [[haplotype]]s frequently found in the Jat Sikhs and Jats of Haryana, and those found in the Romani populations revealed no matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(06)00523-8/abstract?articleId=S1872-4973%2807%2900046-4&amp;articleTitle=Y+chromosome+haplotype+reference+database+%28YHRD%29%3A+Update&amp;citedBy=false&amp;medlinePmidWithoutMDLNPrefix=&amp;overridingDateRestriction=&amp;related=true&amp;restrictdesc_author=&amp;restrictDescription=&amp;restrictterm_author=&amp;search=&amp;search_area=platform&amp;search_currenturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsigenetics.com%2Farticle%2FPIIS1872497307000464%2Frelated&amp;search_datecombo=&amp;search_dateradio=combo&amp;search_doi=&amp;search_federated=no&amp;search_hits=13073&amp;search_id=&amp;search_issue=&amp;search_medline=no&amp;search_monthendcombo=&amp;search_monthstartcombo=&amp;search_operator1=&amp;search_operator2=&amp;search_preview=no&amp;search_query=Related+to%3A+Y+chromosome+haplotype+reference+database+%28YHRD%29%3A+Update&amp;search_reqcount=20&amp;search_reqfirst=1&amp;search_sort=relevance&amp;search_source=All+Periodicals&amp;search_startpage=&amp;search_text1=&amp;search_text2=&amp;search_text3=&amp;search_text4=&amp;search_volume=&amp;search_within1=&amp;search_within2=&amp;search_within3=&amp;search_wordsexactly=yes&amp;search_yearend=&amp;search_yearstart=&amp;searchDisciplineField=all&amp;select1=relevance&amp;select1=relevance&amp;select2=no&amp;select2=no&amp;select3=20&amp;select3=20&amp;terms1=&amp;terms2=&amp;terms3= |title=The search with the Jat Sikhs and Jats of Haryana most frequent haplotypes resulted no matches in Romani populations. |publisher=Fsijournal.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009 researchers discovered the &quot;Jat mutation&quot;, which causes a type of [[glaucoma]] in Romani people. Their press release stated:

{{quote|&quot;An international collaboration led by Manir Ali of the [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine]], first identified the ‘Jatt’ [[mutation]] in one of four [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] families. Further study amongst Roma populations in Europe showed that the same mutation accounted for nearly half of all cases of PCG [Primary congenital glaucoma] in that community. Manir Ali’s research also confirms the widely accepted view that the Roma originated from the [[Jat people|Jatt]] clan of [[North India|Northern India]] and [[Pakistan]] and not from [[Eastern Europe]] as previously believed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leeds.ac.uk/media/press_releases/current09/glaucoma.htm Leeds University Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Language origins ===
The cause of the Romani [[diaspora]] is unknown. However, according to a theory the Romanies were part of the military in [[North India|Northern India]]. When there were invasions by [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] and these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This occurred between AD 1000 and 1030. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} There are many nomadic groups in South Asia, such as Banjara, that migrate due to climatic and political reasons.

This departure date is assumed because, linguistically speaking, the Romani language is a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA) − it has only two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine). Until around the year 1000, the Indo-Aryan languages, named [[Middle Indo-Aryan]] (MIA), had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter). By the turn of the 2nd millennium, they changed over to the NIA phase, losing the neuter gender. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine, while a few became feminine.  For instance, the neuter अग्नि (agni) in the Prakrit language, became the feminine आग (āg) in Hindi and ''jag'' in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages is proposed to prove that the change occurred on the [[South Asia]]. 

It is therefore considered impossible that the ancestors of the Romani people left India prior to AD 1000. They then stayed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] for several hundred years. However, the Muslim expansion, mainly made by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]], into the Byzantine Empire recommenced the movement of the Romani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Vagish |last=Shastri|title=Migration of Aryans from India|publisher=Yogic Voice Consciousness Institute|location=Varanasi|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-to-late 18th century, theories of the origin of the Romani were mostly speculative. In 1782,  Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger published his research that pointed out the relationship between the [[Romani language]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work supported the hypothesis that Romani shared a common origin with the Indo-Aryan languages of Northern India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The majority of historians accepted this as evidence of an [[Saraiki people|Saraiki]] origin for the Romanies, though some scholars maintained that the Romanies acquired the language through contact with Indian merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Domari and Romani language ====
{{Main|Domari language}}

[[Domari]] was once thought to be the &quot;sister language&quot; of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the [[South Asia]], but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the  [[Central zone]] ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) [[Saraiki language]] group of languages. The Dom and the Rom are therefore likely to be descendants of two different migration waves out of  North West India or Pakistan, separated by several centuries.&lt;ref name = What_is_Domari&gt;{{Cite web | title = What is Domari? | url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/files/21_domari.shtml | accessdate = 2008-07-23 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Genetic evidence===
Further evidence for the South Asian origin of the Romanies came in the late 1990s.  Researchers doing DNA analysis discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular [[Y chromosome]]s (inherited paternally) and [[mitochondrial DNA]] (inherited maternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from [[South Asia]].

47.3% of Romani men carry Y chromosomes of [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|haplogroup H-M82]] which is rare outside the [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kalaydjieva&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a form of the inherited disorder [[Congenital myasthenic syndrome|congenital myasthenia]] is found in Romani subjects. This form of the disorder, caused by the 1267delG mutation, is otherwise  known only in subjects of Indian ancestry.  This is considered to be the best evidence of the Indian ancestry of the Romanies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bharti_Morar&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mutation history of the Roma-Gypsies |url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:15322984 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanies have been described as &quot;a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luba_Kalaydjieva&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic studies of the Roma (Gypsies): A review |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/2/5 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |doi=10.1186/1471-2350-2-5 |year=2001 |last=Kalaydjieva |first=Luba |journal=BMC Medical Genetics |volume=2 |pages=5 |pmid=11299048 |last2=Gresham |first2=D |last3=Calafell |first3=F |pmc=31389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of common Mendelian disorders found among Romanies from all over Europe indicates &quot;a common origin and [[founder effect]]&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;Luba_Kalaydjieva&quot;/&gt; See also this table:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/2/5/figure/F4&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests &quot;a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;David_Gresham&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Origins and Divergence of the Roma (Gypsies) |accessdate=2008-06-16 |pmid=11704928 |year=2001 |last1=Gresham |first1=D |last2=Morar |first2=B |last3=Underhill |first3=PA |last4=Passarino |first4=G |last5=Lin |first5=AA |last6=Wise |first6=C |last7=Angelicheva |first7=D |last8=Calafell |first8=F |last9=Oefner |first9=PJ |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=1314–31 |doi=10.1086/324681 |pmc=1235543 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the study pointed out that &quot;[[genetic drift]] and different levels and sources of admixture, appear to have played a role in the subsequent differentiation of populations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;David_Gresham&quot;/&gt; The same study found that &quot;a single lineage ... found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males.

A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romanies are &quot;a founder population of common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bharti_Morar&quot;/&gt; The same study revealed that this population &quot;was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bharti_Morar&quot;/&gt;

====Connection with the Burushos and Pamiris====
The [[Burusho people|Burushos]] of [[Hunza]] have a paternal lineage genetic marker that is grouped with [[Pamiri]] speakers from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikstan]], and the [[Sinti]] Romani ethnic group. This find of shared genetic haplogroups may indicate an origin of the Romani people in or around these regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/98/18/10244.full The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible connection with the Jat people====

While the South Asian origin of the Romani people has been long considered a certitude, the exact South Asian group from whom the Romanies have descended has been a matter of debate. The recent discovery of the &quot;Jat mutation&quot; that causes a type of [[glaucoma]] in Romani populations suggests that the Romani people are the descendants of the [[Jat people]] found in Northern India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jatt mutation&quot;&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146142.php Jatt mutation found in Romani populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

This contradicted an earlier study that compared the most common haplotypes found in Romani groups with those found in Jats from Haryana and Punjab and found no matches, this could have been due to better scientific methods being developed.&lt;ref&gt;''Searching for the origin of Romanies'' http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18768723&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|haplogroup H]], which is the most common haplogroup in Romanis, is more prevalent in central India than it is in northern India.

==Early records==

Many Antique historians mention a tribe by the name of [[Sigynnae]] (Tsigani) on various locations in Europe. Early records of itinerant populations from India begin as early as the [[Sassanid]] period.  Donald Kenrick notes the first recorded presence of ''[[Zott]]'' in [[Baghdad]] in AD 420, [[Khaneikin]] in AD 834.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;&gt;Donald Kenrick, &quot;Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies),&quot; Second Edition, Scarecrow Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars have suggested one of the first written references to the Romanies, under the term ''&quot;Atsingani&quot;'', (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ατσίγγανοι - atsinganoi''), dates from the [[Byzantine]] era during a time of famine in the 9th century. In the year AD 800, [[Athanasia of Aegina|Saint Athanasia]] gave food to &quot;foreigners called the Atsingani&quot; near [[Thrace]]. Later, in AD 803, [[Theophanes the Confessor]] wrote that Emperor [[Nicephorus I|Nikephoros I]] had the help of the ''&quot;Atsingani&quot;'' to put down a riot with their &quot;knowledge of magic&quot;. However, the Atsingani were a Manichean sect that disappeared from chronicles in the 11th century. ''&quot;Atsinganoi&quot;'' was used to refer to itinerant fortune tellers, ventriloquists and wizards who visited the Emperor [[Constantine IX]] in the year 1054.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuviyam.com/scr/index.asp?pLang=E&amp;pHead=90&amp;pMenu=1&amp;pIssue=31 Indian studies]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[hagiographical]] text, ''The Life of St. George the Anchorite,'' mentions that the ''&quot;Atsingani&quot;'' were called on by Constantine to help rid his forests of the wild animals which were killing off his livestock.

==Europe==
[[File:Movimiento gitano.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The migration of the Romani people through the [[Middle East]] and [[Northern Africa]] to Europe.]]
In 1322 a Franciscan monk named [[Simon Simeonis]] described people in likeness to the &quot;atsingani&quot; living in [[Crete]] and in 1350 [[Ludolphus of Sudheim]] mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called ''Mandapolos'', a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word ''Mantipolos - Μαντιπόλος''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florilegium.org/files/CULTURES/Gypsies-msg.html Gypsy Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*m%3Aentry+group%3D4%3Aentry%3Dmantipo%2Flos frenzied]&quot; from ''mantis - μάντις'' (meaning &quot;[[prophet]], [[fortune teller]]&quot;) and ''poleo - πολέω''.

Around 1360, a [[fiefdom]] (called the ''[[Feudum Acinganorum]]'') was established in [[Corfu]]. It mainly used Romani serfs and the Romanies on the island were subservient.&lt;ref&gt;Bright Balkan morning: Romani lives &amp; the power of music in Greek Macedonia, Charles Keil et al, 2002, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rPxA6JA49B4C&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22Feudum+Acinganorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bXJWTbyIH9C74gbYgq3xBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Feudum%20Acinganorum%22&amp;f=false p.108]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsies, Angus M.

By the 14th century, the Romanies had reached the [[Balkans]] and [[Bohemia]]; by the 15th century, [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]; and by the 16th century, [[Russia]], [[Denmark]], [[Scotland]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt; (although DNA evidence from mid-11th century skeletons in [[Norwich]] suggest that at least a few individuals may have arrived earlier, perhaps due to [[Viking]] enslavement of Romani from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] or liaisons with the [[Varangians]]&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, M. (2006) DNA Surprise: Romani in England 440 years too early. ''British Archaeology'' '''89''' (July/August): 9&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Some Romanies migrated from Persia through [[North Africa]], reaching Europe via [[Spain]] in the 15th century. The two currents met in France. Romanies began immigrating to the [[United States]] in colonial times, with small groups in [[Virginia]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]]. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of [[Romnichal]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of [[Kalderash]]. Many Romanies also settled in [[Latin America]].

According to historian [[Norman Davies]], a 1378 law passed by the governor of [[Nauplion]] in the Greek [[Peloponnese]] confirming privileges for the &quot;atstingani&quot; is &quot;the first documented record of Romany Gypsies in Europe.&quot;  Similar documents, again representing the Romanies as a group that had been exiled from Egypt, record them reaching [[Braşov]], [[Transylvania]] in 1416; [[Hamburg]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1418; and [[Paris]] in 1427.  A chronicler for a Parisian journal described them as dressed in a manner that the Parisians considered shabby, and reports that the Church had them leave town because they practiced [[Chiromancy|palm-reading]] and [[fortune-telling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Davies 1996 387–388&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Europe: A History]]|author=[[Norman Davies]]|isbn=0-19-820171-0 |year=1996|pages=387–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in [[Wallachia]], they were issued safe conduct by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1417.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt; Romanies were ordered expelled from the [[Meissen]] region of Germany in 1416, [[Lucerne]] in 1471, [[Milan]] in 1493, [[France]] in 1504, [[Catalonia]] in 1512, [[Sweden]] in 1525, [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1530 (see [[Egyptians Act 1530]]), and [[Denmark]] in 1536.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt; In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered to be put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, and Denmark in 1589, whereas [[Portugal]] began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

Later, a 1596 English statute, however, gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked; France passed a similar law in 1683. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great of Russia]] declared the Romanies &quot;crown slaves&quot; (a status superior to [[serfs]]), but also kept them out of certain parts of [[St. Petersburg, Russia|the capital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Davies 1996 387–388&quot;/&gt; In 1595, [[Ştefan Răzvan]] overcame his birth into slavery, and became the [[Voivode]] ([[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]]) of [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

In [[Wallachia]], [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldova]], Romanies were enslaved for five centuries, until [[abolition of slavery|abolition]] in the mid-19th century.

In the late 19th century, the Romani culture inspired in their neighbors a wealth of artistic works.  Among the most notable works are [[Carmen (novella)|''Carmen'']] and ''[[La Vie de Bohème]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Davies 1996 387–388&quot;/&gt;

===Settlement===
In 1758, [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] began a program of assimilation to turn  Romanies into ''ujmagyar'' (new Hungarians). The government built permanent huts to replace mobile tents, forbade travel, and forcefully removed children from their parents to be fostered by non-Romani.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt; By 1894, the majority of Romanies counted in a Hungarian national census were sedentary. In 1830, Romani children in [[Nordhausen]] were taken from their families to be fostered by Germans.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

Russia also encouraged settlement of all nomads in 1783, and the Polish introduced a settlement law in 1791. Bulgaria and Serbia banned nomadism in the 1880s.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

In 1783, racial legislation against Romanies was repealed in the [[United Kingdom]], and a specific &quot;Turnpike Act&quot; was established in 1822 to prevent nomads from camping on the roadside, strengthened in the Highways Act of 1835.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

===Pre-war organization===
In 1879, a national meeting of Romanies was held in the Hungarian town of [[Kisfalu]] (now [[Pordašinci]], [[Slovenia]]). Romanies in Bulgaria set up a conference in 1919 to protest for their right to vote, and a Romani journal, ''Istiqbal'' (Future) was founded in 1923.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]], the All-Russian Union of Gypsies was organized in 1925 with a journal, ''Romani Zorya'' (Romani Dawn) beginning two years later. The ''Romengiro Lav'' (Romani Word) writer's circle encouraged works by authors like [[Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pankov]] and [[Nina Dudarova]].&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

A General Association of the Gypsies of Romania was established in 1933 with a national conference, and two journals, ''Neamul Tiganesc'' (Gypsy Nation) and ''Timpul'' (Time). An &quot;international&quot; conference was organized in [[Bucharest]] the following year.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

In Yugoslavia, Romani journal ''Romano Lil'' started publication in 1935.&lt;ref name = &quot;kenrick&quot;/&gt;

===Porajmos===
{{main|Porajmos}}

[[File:Porajmos.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Newly arrived Romanies at the [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] [[concentration camp]] in 1940.]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazis]] murdered 220,000 to 1,500,000 Romanies in an attempted [[genocide]] referred to as the ''[[Porajmos]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton estimates&quot;&gt;[http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles=true ROMANIES AND THE HOLOCAUST: A REEVALUATION AND AN OVERVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Jew]]s, they were sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in [[concentration camp]]s. They were often killed on sight, especially by the [[Einsatzgruppen]] on the Eastern Front.

===Post-war history===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
In [[Communism|Communist]] central and eastern Europe, Romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions of cultural freedom. The Romani language and Romani music were banned from public performance in [[Bulgaria]]. In Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Romanies from Slovakia, Hungary and Romania were re-settled in border areas of Czech lands and their nomadic lifestyle was forbidden. In Czechoslovakia, where they were labeled as a “socially degraded stratum,” Romani women were [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]] as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future social welfare payments, misinformation, and [[Compulsory sterilization|involuntary sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Carol. “Persecution and Politicization: Roma (Gypsies) of Eastern Europe.” Cultural Survival Quarterly, Summer 1995. Helsinki Watch. Struggling for Ethnic Identity: Czechoslovakia’s Endangered Gypsies. New York, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Germany deported tens of thousands of migrants to central and eastern Europe. Sixty percent of some 100,000 Romanian nationals deported under a 1992 treaty were Romani.

During the 1990s and early 21st century many Romanies from central and eastern Europe attempted to migrate to western Europe or Canada. The majority of them were turned back. Several of these countries established strict visa requirements to prevent further migration.

In 2005, the [[Decade of Roma Inclusion]] was launched in nine [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries to improve the socio-economic status and social inclusion of the Romani minority across the region.

==America==
Romanies began immigrating to the [[United States]] in colonial times, with small groups in [[Virginia]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]]. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of [[Romnichal]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the [[Vlax]] group of [[Kalderash]]. Many Romanies also settled in other countries of the [[Americas]].

===Czech-Canadian Exodus===
In August 1997, [[Nova (Czech TV)|TV Nova]], a popular television station in the [[Czech Republic]], broadcast a documentary on the situation of Romanies who had emigrated to [[Canada]].&lt;ref name = &quot;exodus&quot;&gt;[http://romove.radio.cz/en/clanek/18857 The Roma Exodus to Canada], romove.radio.cz&lt;/ref&gt; The short report portrayed Romanies in Canada living comfortably with support from the state, and sheltered from racial discrimination and violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026165931/http://geocities.com/~patrin/canada.htm ERRC Statement Regarding Canada as Haven for Roma], Patrin Web Journal, 17 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, life was particularly difficult for many Romanies living in the Czech Republic. As a result of the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], many Romanies were left without citizenship in either the Czech Republic or [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name = &quot;promised&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/newsinreview/dec97/gypsies/index.html Gypsies in Canada: The Promised Land?], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Following the large flood in [[Moravia]] in July, many Romanies were left homeless yet unwelcome in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name = &quot;exodus&quot;/&gt;

Almost overnight, there were reports of Romanies preparing to emigrate to Canada. According to one report, 5,000 Romani from the city of [[Ostrava]] intended to move. Mayors in some Czech towns encouraged the exodus, offering to help pay for flights so that Romanies could leave. The following week, the Canadian Embassy in Prague was receiving hundreds of calls a day from Romanies and flights between the Czech Republic and Canada were sold out until October.&lt;ref name = &quot;exodus&quot;/&gt; In 1997, 1,285 people from the Czech Republic arrived in Canada and claimed [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|refugee status]], a rather significant jump from the 189 Czechs who did so the previous year.&lt;ref name = &quot;promised&quot;/&gt;

Lucie Cermakova, a spokesperson at the Canadian Embassy in Prague, criticized the program, claiming it &quot;presented only one side of the matter and picked out only nonsensical ideas.&quot; Marie Jurkovicova, a spokesperson for the Czech Embassy in Ottawa suggested that &quot;the program was full of half-truths, which strongly distorted reality and practically invited the exodus of large groups of Czech Romanies. It concealed a number of facts.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;exodus&quot;/&gt;

President [[Václav Havel]] and (after some hesitation) Prime Minister [[Václav Klaus]] attempted to convince the Romanies not to leave. With the help of Romani leaders like [[Emil Scuka]], Chairman of the [[Roma Civic Initiative]], they urged Romanies to remain in country and work to solve their problems with the larger Czech population.

The movement of Romanies to Canada had been fairly easy because [[Visa (document)|visa]] requirements for Czech citizens had been lifted by the [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada|Canadian government]] in April 1996. In response to the influx of Romanies, the Canadian government reinstated the visa requirements for all Czechs as of October 8, 1997.

==Romani Nationalism==
[[File:Roma flag.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flag of the Romani people]]]]

Roma nationalism has become an increasingly significant movement in Roma politics.

The first World Romani Congress was organized in 1971 near [[London]], funded in part by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Government of India]]. It was attended by representatives from [[India]] and 20 other countries. At the congress, the green and blue flag from the 1933 conference, embellished with the red, sixteen-spoked [[chakra]], was reaffirmed as the national emblem of the Romani people, and the anthem, &quot;''[[Gelem, Gelem]]''&quot; was adopted. 

The [[International Romani Union]] was officially established in 1977, and in 1990, the fourth World Congress declared April 8 to be [[International Day of the Roma]], a day to celebrate [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]] and raise awareness of the issues facing the Romani community.

The 5th World Romany Congress in 2000  issued an official declaration of the Romany non-territorial nation.
