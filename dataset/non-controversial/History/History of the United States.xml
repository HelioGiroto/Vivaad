The '''history of the [[United States]]''' as covered in American schools and universities typically begins with either [[Christopher Columbus|Christopher Columbus's]] 1492 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyage to the Americas]] or with the prehistory of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native peoples]], with the latter approach having become increasingly common in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;For a capsule online history see Alonzo Hamby, &quot;Outline of U.S. History&quot; (2010) [http://www.america.gov/publications/books/history-outline.html online]; for recent textbooks see  David M. Kennedy and Lizabeth Cohen, '' The American Pageant'' (15th ed. 2012);  James A. Henretta, Rebecca Edwards and Robert O. Self, ''America's History'' (7th ed. 2011);  James L. Roark, et al. ''American Promise'' (4th ed. 2011);  Robert A. Divine, et al. ''America Past and Present'' (8th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States of America began as an independent nation with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776. [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] reached the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific]] coasts, but the largest settlements were by the [[English American|English]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]], starting in 1607. By the 1770s, the [[Thirteen Colonies]] contained two and a half million people. They were prosperous and growing rapidly, and had developed their own political and legal systems.  The Parliament asserted its authority by imposing new taxes, which the American insisted were unconstitutional because the colonists were not represented in Parliament. It became a test of strength and neither side would back down, but the 13 colonies began collaborating. Protests culminated in the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773; Britain stripped Massachusetts of self-government and the colonists started drilling their militia. All out war began in April 1775.  After expelling Royal officials and clamping down on Loyalists, the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] took control. The July 1776,  Declaration of Independence, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] proclaimed that all men are born equal and announced the formation of a new nation, the United States of America. With major military and financial support from France, and military leadership by General [[George Washington]], the Patriots won the [[American Revolutionary War]] and peace came in 1783. During and after the war, the 13 states were united under a weak federal government established by the [[Articles of Confederation]].  When these became unworkable, a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was written in 1789; it remains the basis of the [[United States federal government]], and soon included a [[Bill of Rights]]. With Washington as the first [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief advisor, a strong national government was created, the national debt was funded, and policies favorable to merchants and financiers enacted.  Jefferson became the opposition leader, because of he feared pro-British and pro-business policies would undermine the [[Republicanism in the United States]] that became the national credo. The result was the formation of popularly based political parties--the first in the world-- in  the [[First Party System]] between Hamilton's Federalists and Jefferson's republicans. The Jeffersonians took control in 1801, and purchased Louisiana, ensuring ample farm lands for future growth,  of monarchy, and fighting a second war with Britain [[War of 1812|in 1812]].

U.S. territory expanded westward across the continent, brushing aside Native Americans and [[Mexico]], and rejecting the advice of [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] who wanted to deepen the economy rather than expand the geography. [[Slavery in the United States|Slavery of Africans]] was abolished in all the [[Northern United States|Northern states]] at the turn of the 19th century, but it flourished in the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] because of heavy European demand for cotton. After 1820, a series of compromises postponed a showdown on the issue of slavery, but in the late 1850s, the new Republican power took political control of the North and promised to stop the expansion of slavery, which implied its eventual death. The [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] triggered a crisis as eleven [[slave and free states|slave states]] seceded to found the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in 1861. The bloody [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) redefined the nation and remains the central iconic event. The South was eventually defeated and, in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the United States ended slavery, extended rights to [[African Americans]], and readmitted secessionist states with loyal governments. The national government was much stronger, and it now had the explicit duty to protect individual rights. Reconstruction ended in 1877 and from the 1890s to the 1960s the system of [[Jim Crow]] (segregation) kept blacks in political, social and economic inferiority. The entire South remained poor until the late 20th century, while the North and West grew rapidly and prospered.

Thanks to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the North and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe, the United States became the leading industrialized power at the turn of the 20th century. Disgust with corruption, waste, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], 1890s–1920s, which pushed for reform in industry and politics and put into the Constitution [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] of alcohol (the latter repealed in 1933). Initially neutral in [[American entry into World War I|World War I]], the U.S. declared war on Germany in 1917, and funded the Allied victory the following year. The nation refused to follow President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s leadership and never joined the [[League of Nations]]. After a prosperous decade in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long world-wide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. A political realignment expelled the Republicans from power and installed Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his elaborate and expensive [[New Deal]] programs for relief, recovery, and reform. Roosevelt's [[New Deal Coalition|Democratic coalition]], comprising ethnics in the North, labor unions, big-city machines, intellectuals, and the white South, dominated national politics into the 1960s. After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in Europe and, with the detonation of newly-invented [[atomic bomb]]s, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in the [[Far East]].

The United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as opposing superpowers after World War II and began the [[Cold War]], confronting one another indirectly in the [[arms race]] and [[Space Race]]. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War was built around containment of Communism. American programs to revitalize the economies of [[Western Europe]] proved successful in the late 1940s, and NATO was formed as a permanent military alliance with largely American leadership. The United States participated in the wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to contain Communist expansion. [[Liberalism in the United States|Liberalism]] won numerous victories in the days of the New Deal and again in the mid-1960s, especially in the success of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955&amp;ndash;1968)|civil rights movement]]. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservatism]] made its comeback in the 1980s under [[Ronald Reagan]]. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States the only superpower. The economy was in transition after 1970 from heavy industry (with strong labor unions) to a [[service economy]] based on high technology. International conflict returned in 2001 following the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[death of Osama bin Laden]]. At the turn of the 21st century, the worldwide [[late-2000s recession|Great Recession]] opened an era of stagnation or slow growth.

==Pre-Columbian era==
{{Main|Pre-Columbian era}}
{{See also|Native Americans in the United States}}

It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first [[settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from [[Eurasia]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued through to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early inhabitants, called [[Paleoamericans]], soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.

The [[pre-Columbian era]] incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the [[Americas|American]] continents, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[Early Modern period]].  While technically referring to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus' initial landing.

==Colonial period==
[[Image:Coronado-Remington.jpg|thumb|right|The Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]] explored parts of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] from 1540 to 1542.]]
{{Main|Colonial history of the United States}}

After a period of exploration by people from various [[Europe]]an countries, [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[France|French]], [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Russia]]n and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlements were established. In the 16th century, Europeans brought horses, cats, cattle, and hogs to the Americas and, in turn, took back to Europe maize, [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], potatoes, tobacco, beans, and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. The disease environment was very unhealthy for explorers and early settlers. The Native Americans became exposed to new diseases such as smallpox and measles and [[Native American disease and epidemics|died in very large numbers]], usually before large-scale European settlement began.&lt;ref&gt;John Mack Faragher, ''The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America'' (1996), passim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hinderaker and Rebecca Horn, &quot;Territorial Crossings: Histories and Historiographies of the Early Americas,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2010) 67#3 pp. 395-432 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5309/willmaryquar.67.3.395 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish, Dutch, and French colonization===
Spanish explorers were the first Europeans  with [[Christopher Columbus]]' [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|second expedition]], which reached Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493; others reached Florida in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenberger, ''Juan Ponce de León: the exploration of Florida and the search for the Fountain of Youth'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Quickly Spanish expeditions reached the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Grand Canyon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyne|first=Stephen J.|title=How the Canyon Became Grand|place=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-670-88110-4|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Plains]]. In 1540, [[Hernando de Soto]] undertook an extensive exploration of Southeast. Also in 1540 [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] explored from Arizona to central Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grove Day, ''Coronado's Quest: The Discovery of the Southwestern States'' (U. of California Press, 1940) [http://www.questia.com/read/66002285  online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish sent some settlers, creating the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States at [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1565, but it attracted few permanent settlers. Much larger and more important Spanish settlements included [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[San Antonio]], [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;David J. Weber, ''New Spain's Far Northern Frontier: Essays on Spain in the American West, 1540–1821'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Netherland]] was the 17th century Dutch colony centered on New York City and the Hudson River Valley, where they traded furs with the Native Americans to the north and were a barrier to [[Yankee]] expansion from [[New England]]. The Dutch were Calvinists who built the [[Reformed Church in America]], but they were tolerant of other religions and cultures. The colony was taken over by Britain in 1664. It left an enduring legacy on  American cultural and political life, including a secular broadmindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city, a rural traditionalism in the countryside typified by the story of [[Rip Van Winkle]], and politicians such as [[Martin Van Buren]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Jacobs, ''The Colony of New Netherland: A Dutch Settlement in Seventeenth-Century America'' (2nd ed. Cornell University Press; 2009) [http://www.questia.com/read/109275503  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New France]] was the area [[French colonization of the Americas|colonized by France]] from 1534 to 1763. There were few permanent settlers outside [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] became military allies of New France through the four [[French and Indian Wars]] with the British colonies who were allied with the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. During the [[French and Indian War]], New England fought successfully against Acadia and the British removed [[Acadians]] from [[Acadia]] ([[Nova Scotia]]) and replaced them with [[New England Planters]].&lt;ref&gt;Brebner, John Bartlet. New England's outpost : Acadia before the conquest of Canada. Archon Books Hamden, Conn. 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, some Acadians resettled in Louisiana, where they developed a distinctive rural [[Cajun]] culture that still exists. They became American citizens in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean Jobb, ''The Cajuns: A People's Story of Exile and Triumph'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Other French villages along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois rivers]] were absorbed when the Americans started arriving after 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Greer, &quot;National, Transnational, and Hypernational Historiographies: New France Meets Early American History,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review'' (2010) 91#4 pp 695–724&lt;/ref&gt;

===British colonization===

The strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by English colonists in the 17th century, along with much smaller numbers of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Swedish ethnic group|Swedes]]. Colonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that employed forms of [[unfree labor]] such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]], and by a British policy of benign neglect ([[salutary neglect]]) that permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.&lt;ref name=&quot;history of colonial&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Henretta |first=James A. |title=History of Colonial America |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html |work=Encarta Online Encyclopedia |year=2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013376663041 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |last=Barker |first=Deanna |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/5klVsFyDj |archivedate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful English colony was established in 1607, on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. It languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established commercial agriculture based on tobacco. Between the late 1610s and the Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to their American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;James Davie Butler, &quot;British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (1896) 2#1 pp. 12-33 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833611 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; A severe instance of conflict was the 1622 [[Powhatan]] uprising in Virginia, in which Native Americans killed hundreds of English settlers. The largest conflict between Native Americans and English settlers in the 17th century was [[King Philip's War]] in [[New England]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tougias|first=Michael|title=King Philip's War in New England |url=http://www.historyplace.com/specials/writers/kingphilip.htm |work=HistoryPlace.com|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yamasee War]] in South Carolina was as bloody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |page= 167}} Online at [http://books.google.com/books?id=_rcFu4KjwVAC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622. Soon the colonists in the South feared all natives as enemies.]]
[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] who established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630, although there was a small earlier settlement in 1620 by a similar group, the Pilgrims, at [[Plymouth Colony]]. The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of [[History of New York|New York]], [[History of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]], were characterized by a large degree of diversity. The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the [[Province of Carolina]], with [[Georgia Colony]] the last of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] established in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The colonies were characterized by religious diversity, with many Congregationalists in New England, German and Dutch Reformed in the Middle Colonies, Catholics in Maryland, and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]] Presbyterians on the frontier.  Many royal officials and merchants were Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Religiosity expanded greatly after the [[First Great Awakening]], a religious revival in the 1740s led by preachers such as  [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. American Evangelicals affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and forwarded the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] beginning in the late 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly because of ample supplies of land and food, and low death rates. They were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who came as indentured servants. The tobacco and rice plantations imported black slaves from the British colonies in the West Indies, and by the 1770s they comprised a fifth of the American population. The question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against French and Spanish power; those threats were gone by 1765. London regarded the American colonies as existing merely for the benefit of the mother country, a policy known as [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA185|date=1948; reprinted 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political integration and autonomy===
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|left|thumb|[[Join, or Die]]: This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]
The [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the main rivals of the British Crown in the colonies and Canada, the French and North American Indians, was significantly reduced. Moreover, the war effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to &quot;Join or Die&quot;. Franklin was a man of many inventions—and his greatest invention was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and was realized in July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.W. Brands|title=The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TLdOMa1MEqsC&amp;pg=PA232|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=232–40, 510–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] with the goal of organizing the new North American empire and protecting the native Indians from colonial expansion into western lands. In ensuing years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies to help pay for troops stationed in North America following the [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|British victory in the Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmund S. Morgan 14–27&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Birth of the Republic, 1763-89|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qr_ruAAACAAJ|date=1956; 4th ed 2012|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government imposed a series new taxes on the colonies without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have this right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying &quot;[[No taxation without representation]],&quot; the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmund S. Morgan 14–27&quot;/&gt;

A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|1846 painting of the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]].]]

The [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 was a direct action by activists in the town of Boston to protest against the British taxes. Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Coercive Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under army rule. which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies.  Patriots from all 13 colonies convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for redress of those grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army. The [[American Revolutionary War]] began at Concord and Lexington in April when the British tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the Patriot leaders.

===The Revolution===
The [[Thirteen Colonies]] began a rebellion against British rule in 1775 and proclaimed their independence in 1776 as the United States of America.  In the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) the American capture of the British invasion army at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]] secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States. France brought in Spain and the Netherlands, thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no allies.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Ferling, ''Independence: The Struggle to Set America Free'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  

General [[George Washington]] (1732–1799) proved an excellent organizer and administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.

As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did.  The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEH EDSITEMENT&quot;&gt;Lesson Plan on &quot;What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?&quot; [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.  As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them.  Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power for himself, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEH EDSITEMENT&quot;/&gt;  Political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] observes, &quot;The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first 'new nation'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, ''The First New Nation'' (1979) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence]]]]
On July 4, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]], meeting in [[Philadelphia]], declared the independence of &quot;the United States of America&quot; in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. July 4 is celebrated as the nation's birthday. The new nation was founded on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of liberalism in what [[Thomas Jefferson]] called the unalienable rights to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,&quot; and dedicated strongly to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] principles. Republicanism emphasized the people are sovereign (not hereditary kings), demanded civic duty, feared corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
===Confederation and Constitution===
In the 1780s the national government was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress and became territories; with the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts.  Nationalists—most of them war veterans—organized in every state and convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787. The delegates from every state wrote a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of [[Natural rights|individual liberty]] and of constraining the power of government through a system of [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, and J. R. Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Congress was given authority to ban the international [[slave trade]] after 20 years (which it did in 1807). The electoral vote of the South was enhanced by counting three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. As slavery expanded in the South during the following decades, this provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress.

To assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195341422/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil religion===
The American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism ever since. As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge), rituals (raising the Liberty Tree), flags (the Betsey Ross flag), sacred holidays (July 4) and a holy scripture (The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;
==Western frontier==
{{main|American Frontier}}
The American colonies and the new nation grew very rapidly in population and area, as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement west.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent overview see Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher, ''Frontiers: A Short History of the American West'' (2008); for elaborate detail see  Howard R. Lamar, ed. ''The New Encyclopedia of the American West'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  The process finally ended around 1890-1910 as the last major farmlands and ranch lands were settled. Native American tribes in some places resisted militarily, but they were overwhelmed by settlers and the army and after 1830 were relocated to Indian reservations in the west. The highly influential &quot;[[Frontier Thesis]]&quot; argues that the frontier shaped the national character, with its boldness, violence, innovation, [[individualism]], and democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert V 2000 p. 10&quot;&gt;Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher, ''The American West: A New Interpretive History'' (Yale University Press, 2000)  p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the frontier.  Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the &quot;Wild West&quot; of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, &quot;frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states&quot;. They explain, &quot;It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert V 2000 p. 10&quot;/&gt; 

Through wars and treaties, establishment of law and order, building farms, ranches and towns, marking trails and digging mines, and pulling in great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of [[Manifest Destiny]]. As the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the west in fiction and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike.  America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image. &quot;No other nation&quot;, says David Murdoch, &quot;has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America’s creation of the West&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Murdoch, ''The American West: The Invention of a Myth'' (2001) page vii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington established a strong government===
[[George Washington]]—a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]—became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.  The national capital moved from New York to Philadelphia and finally settled in Washington DC in 1800. 

The major accomplishments of the [[Presidency of George Washington|Washington Administration]] were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest McDonald, ''The Presidency of George Washington'' (1974) &lt;/ref&gt; His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], assumed the debts of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure.  To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party—the first in the world based on voters—the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]].

[[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] formed an opposition Republican Party (usually called the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] by political scientists). Hamilton and Washington presented the country in 1794 with the [[Jay Treaty]] that reestablished good relations with Britain. The Jeffersonians vehemently protested, and the voters aligned behind one party or the other, thus setting up the [[First Party System]].  Federalists promoted business, financial and commercial interests and wanted more trade with Britain. Republicans accused the Federalists of plans to establish a monarchy, turn the rich into a ruling class, and making the United States a pawn of the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;/&gt;  The treaty passed, but politics became intensely heated.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era: 1789–1801'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794, when western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor, was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington called out the state militia and personally led an army, as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national government was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Lesson Plan on &quot;Washington and the Whiskey Rebellion&quot; [http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/washington-and-whiskey-rebellion NEH EDSITEMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington refused to serve more than two terms—setting a precedent—and in famous [[George Washington's Farewell Address|his farewell address]], he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington's Farewell Address |url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/farewell/|work=Archiving Early America|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Adams]], a Federalist, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election. War loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the Republicans with the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], build up a large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French invasion.  However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798.&lt;ref&gt;David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2008) ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;&gt;Marshall Smelser, &quot;The Jacobin Phrenzy: The Menace of Monarchy, Plutocracy, and Anglophilia, 1789-1798,&quot; ''Review of Politics'' (1959) 21#1 pp 239-258 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405347 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
During the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of freed blacks. Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and their lesser economic reliance on it, northern states abolished slavery, although some had gradual emancipation schemes. States of the [[Upper South]] made manumission easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in the Upper South from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. By that date, a total of 13.5 percent of all blacks in the United States were free.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877,'' New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, with the demand for slaves on the rise with the development of the Deep South for cotton cultivation, the rate of manumissions declined sharply, and an internal slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders.

===Jefferson===
[[Image:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|thumb|200px|Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.]]
[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|thumb|350px|Territorial expansion; [[Louisiana Purchase]] in white.]]
[[Thomas Jefferson]] defeated Adams for the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 election]].  Jefferson's major achievement as president was the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815'' (2009) pp 368–74&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jefferson, a scientist himself, supported expeditions to explore and map the new domain, most notably the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson believed deeply in [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and argued it should be based on the independent [[yeoman]] farmer and planter; he distrusted cities, factories and banks. He also distrusted the federal government and judges, and tried to weaken the judiciary.  However he met his match in [[John Marshall]], a Federalist from Virginia who was his distant cousin. Although the Constitution included a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], its functions were vague until Marshall, the Chief Justice (1801–35), defined them, especially the power to overturn acts of Congress that violated the Constitution, first enunciated in 1803 in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) pp 309-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
{{Main|War of 1812}}

Americans were increasingly angry at the British violation of American ships' neutral rights in order to hurt France, the [[impressment]] (seizure) of 10,000 American sailors needed by the Royal Navy to fight Napoleon, and British support for hostile Indians attacking American settlers in the Midwest. Despite strong opposition from federalists in the Northeast who did not want to disrupt trade with Britain, Congress declared war in June 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''Empire of Liberty'' (2009) ch 18&lt;/ref&gt;  

The war was frustrating for both sides. American invasions of Canada were repeatedly repulsed, as the American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General [[William Henry Harrison]] finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under [[Tecumseh]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, &quot;Tecumseh, Harrison, and the War of 1812,&quot; ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (March 1969) 65#1 pp 25-44 [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu.proxy.cc.uic.edu/iudl/imh/printable/VAA4025-065-1-a02 online]&lt;/ref&gt; while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. 

The British raided and burned Washington, carrying away numerous slaves, but were repelled at Baltimore in 1814. Also in 1814 a major British invasion of New York State was turned back.  In early 1815 [[Andrew Jackson]] decisively defeated a major British invasion at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], making him the most famous war hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Stagg, 2012&quot;&gt;J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812: Conflict for a Continent'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

With Napoleon (apparently) gone, the causes of the war had evaporated and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries intact. Americans celebrated a new spirit of national pride, as the antiwar Federalist Party practically disappeared.  The Indians were the big losers; they never gained the independent nationhood Britain had promised and no longer were a threat as settlers poured into the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Stagg, 2012&quot;/&gt;

===Era of Good Feelings===
As strong opponents of the war, the Federalists held the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National euphoria after the victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they no longer played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;James Banner, ''To the Hartford Convention: the Federalists and the Origins of Party Politics in Massachusetts, 1789–1815'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; President Madison and most Republicans realized they were foolish to let the Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war.  So they chartered the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1816.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Dangerfield 1812&quot;&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feellings: America Comes of Age in the Period of Monroe and Adams Between the War of 1812, and the Ascendancy of Jackson'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Goodman 1967&quot;&gt;Paul Goodman, &quot;The First American Party System&quot; in William Nisbet Chambers and Walter Dean Burnham, eds. ''The American Party Systems: Stages of Political Development'' (1967), 56–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President [[James Monroe]] in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an [[Era of Good Feelings]], with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the [[First Party System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;George Dangerfield 1812&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Goodman 1967&quot;/&gt;

The [[Monroe Doctrine]], expressed in 1823, proclaimed the United States' opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the Americas. This was a defining moment in the [[foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]] of the United States. The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark T. Gilderhus, &quot;The Monroe Doctrine: Meanings and Implications,&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' March 2006, Vol. 36#1 pp 5–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian removal===
[[Image:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|thumb|250px|Settlers crossing the [[Great Plains|Plains of Nebraska]].]]

In 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;David Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Indian Removal'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  President Andrew Jackson was a proponent of the forcible removal of native populations to the West; Whigs and religious leaders opped the move as inhumane. The act resulted most notably in the [[Trail of Tears]], a forced migration of several native tribes to the West, with several thousand people dying en route.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vincent Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west; they fought the Army for years in the [[Seminole Wars]].

===Abolitionism===
After 1840 the growing [[abolitionist]] movement redefined itself  as a crusade against the sin of slave ownership. It mobilized support (especially among religious women in the Northeast affected by the [[Second Great Awakening]]). [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published the most influential of the many anti-slavery newspapers, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', while [[Frederick Douglass]], an ex-slave, began writing for that newspaper around 1840 and started his own abolitionist newspaper ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]]'' in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;John Stauffer, ''Giants: The Parallel Lives of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln, rejected Garrison's theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Molly Oshatz|title=Slavery and Sin: The Fight Against Slavery and the Rise of Liberal Protestantism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vVqfW0SXpRUC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas and California ===
The [[Texas Annexation|Republic of Texas was annexed]] in 1845, which Mexico had warned meant war. The [[U.S. army]], using regulars and large numbers of volunteers, easily won the [[Mexican-American War]], 1846–48. Public sentiment in the U.S. was divided as Whigs and anti-slavery elements opposed the war. The 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] ceded California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada,  and adjacent areas to the United States, with the residents given full citizenship. Simultaneously gold was discovered, pulling over 100,000 men to northern California in a matter of months in the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;Hine and Faragher, ''The American West'' (2000) ch 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War era (1849–1865)==
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}

[[Image:US Secession map 1863 (BlankMap derived).png|thumb|350px|The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]: blue (free), yellow (slave);&lt;br /&gt; The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]: brown&lt;br /&gt;*territories in light shades]]
The central issue after 1848 was the expansion of slavery, pitting the anti-slavery elements that were a majority in the North, against the pro-slavery elements that overwhelmingly dominated the white South. A small number of very active Northerners were [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition.  Much larger numbers were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor (no slaves), and free speech (as opposed to censorship rampant in the South.) Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic social and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all antislavery spokesmen as &quot;abolitionists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious activists split on slavery, with the Methodists and Baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the Methodists, Congregationalists and Quakers included many abolitionists, especially among women activists. The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Sensbach. Review of McKivigan, John R.; Snay, Mitchell, eds., ''Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery'' H-SHEAR, H-Net Reviews. January, 2000. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3744 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the [[Compromise of 1850]] brokered by Whig [[Henry Clay]] and Democrat [[Stephen Douglas]]; the Compromise included admission of California as a [[free state (United States)|free state]]. The sore point was the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] to make it easier for masters to reclaim runaway slaves. Abolitionists fastened on the Act to attack slavery, as in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus M. Bordewich, ''America's Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Compromise of 1820 was repealed in 1854 with the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of &quot;[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]]&quot; and democracy. It permitted settlers to decide on slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to say he was neutral on the slavery issue. Antislavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Pro and anti-forces rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a mini civil war called [[Bleeding Kansas]]. By the late 1850s the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college, and insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson, ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern slave societies had become wealthy based on their cotton and other commodity production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade.  They were tied to northern cities such as Boston and New York by banking, shipping, and manufacturing.  By 1860, there were four million slaves in [[Southern United States|the South]], nearly eight times as many as the total slaves nationwide in 1790. The plantations were highly profitable because of the heavy European demand for raw cotton; most of the profits were invested in new lands and new slaves drawn from the declining tobacco regions. For 50 of the nation's first 72 years a slaveholder served as president of the United States and, during that period, only slaveholding presidents were re-elected to second terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html &quot;Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City&quot;], PBS Newshour, January 25, 2007, Retrieved February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In addition, southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations.

Slave rebellions were planned or actually took place —including by [[Gabriel Prosser]] (1800), [[Denmark Vesey]] (1822), and [[Nat Turner]] (1831)—but they all failed.  They led southern states to establish tighter slave oversight as well as reducing rights of [[free people of color|free blacks]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' took the Southern position of making slavery legal everywhere, which outraged northerners.

[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abraham Lincoln]] with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]
After [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states seceded from the union between late 1860 and 1861, establishing a new government, the [[Confederate States of America]], on February 8, 1861. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. Along with the northwestern portion of Virginia, which became [[West Virginia]], four of the five northernmost &quot;[[slave and free states|slave states]]&quot; did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
{{Main|American Civil War}}

[[American Civil War|The Civil War]] began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], which ended in a surprising Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than they had originally anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012) ch 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

The war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was quite successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E.

Warfare in the Eastern theater started poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling confident in his army after defeating the Union at [[Second Bull Run]], Lee embarked on an [[Maryland Campaign|invasion of the north]] that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]]. Despite this, McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The next commander, General [[Ambrose Burnside]], suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee's smaller army at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]].  But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war weariness in the North.  In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1–3, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, &quot;To Conquer a Peace?&quot; ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26-33, online at EBSCO
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle of Franklin II 1864.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864]]

Simultaneously on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies.

The last two years of the war was bloody for both sides, with Grant launching a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against General Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns.  The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|sieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency as happened in Iraq in 2003.

Based on [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] figures, about 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% from the North and 18% from the South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maris Vinovskis|title=Toward a Social History of the American Civil War: Exploratory Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9D4TAwc93VoC|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge U.P. |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the American Civil War as the deadliest war in American history. Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government.

===Reconstruction===
{{Further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
[[File:FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg|thumb|[[Freedman|Freedmen]] voting in New Orleans, 1867]]
[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] lasted from Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863 to the [[Compromise of 1877]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012) pp 445-513 is a brief treatment; see also  Eric Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The major issues faced by Washington were the status of the ex-slaves (called &quot;Freedmen&quot;), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions. 

The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the [[Freedman's Bureau]], operated by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A, Cimbala, ''The Freedmen's Bureau: Reconstructing the American South after the Civil War'' (2005) includes a brief history and primary documents&lt;/ref&gt;

Three &quot;[[Reconstruction Amendments]]&quot; were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans. the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]  outlawed slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] guaranteed equal rights for all, and citizenship for blacks; the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prevented race from being used to disfranchise men.

Although ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for over two years, that changed when the [[Radical Republicans]] gained effective control of Congress in the 1866 elections. President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless; he escaped by one vote removal through impeachment. Congress enfranchised black men and stripped many ex-Confederate leasers of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen, [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites. State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic coalition, which gained control of the entire South by 1877. In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan and it disbanded. However there were other paramilitary groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] that worked to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Reconstruction ended after the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 election]] between Republican candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]]. With a compromise Hayes won the election, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Southern Democrats re-entered the national political scene.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Ayers, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992) pp 3-54&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1890 southern states effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] black voters. Blacks were segregated in public and remained second class citizens until the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|successes of the Civil Rights movement in 1964-65]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' (3rd ed. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sitkoff, ''The Struggle for Black Equality'' (3rd ed. 2008) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western expansion and Indian wars===
[[Image:1869-Golden Spike.jpg|thumb|250px|Completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) at [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], by Andrew J. Russell.]]
The latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the United States' development and settlement of the West, first by wagon trains and then aided by the completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]], and frequent Indian wars as settlers encroached on traditional Native American lands. Gradually the US purchased their lands and extinguished their claims, forcing most tribes onto restricted [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. According to the [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]] (1894),
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The [[American Indian Wars|Indian wars]] under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bureau of the Census|title=Report on Indians taxed and Indians not taxed in the United States (except Alaska)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KWkUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637|year=1894|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gilded Age===
{{Main|Gilded Age}}
The &quot;[[Gilded Age]]&quot; was a term that [[Mark Twain]] used to describe the period of the late 19th century when there had been a dramatic expansion of American wealth and prosperity. Reform of the Age included the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Civil Service Act]], which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs. Other important legislation included the [[Interstate Commerce Act]], which ended railroads' discrimination against small shippers, and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which outlawed monopolies in business. Twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators, scandalous politics, and unethical business practices.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Trachtenberg, ''The Incorporation of America: Culture and Society in the Gilded Age'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1890 American industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other world nations. In response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices, wheat and cotton farmers joined the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Learn About the Gilded Age|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/gilded_age/index.cfm |work=Digital History|publisher=University of Houston|date=2008-06-05|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unprecedented wave of [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] from Europe served to both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas. From 1880 to 1914, peak years of immigration, more than 22 million people migrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.theusaonline.com/people/growth.htm Growth of U.S. Population]&quot;. TheUSAonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The workers' demand for control of their workplace led to the often-violent rise of the [[labor movement]] in the cities and mining camps.  Industrial leaders included [[John D. Rockefeller]] in oil and [[Andrew Carnegie]] in steel; both became leaders of philanthropy, giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals, universities, libraries and foundations.

Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A severe nationwide depression broke out in 1893; it was called the [[Panic of 1893]] and impacted farmers, workers and businessmen who saw prices, wages and profits fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hoffmann, &quot;The Depression of the Nineties,&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' (1956) 16#2 pp 137–164. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2114113 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Many railroads went bankrupt and the political reaction saw the collapse of the Democratic Party, whose leader President [[Grover Cleveland]] shouldered much of the blame. Labor unrest involved numerous strikes, most notably the violent [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, which was shut down by federal troops under Cleveland's orders.  The [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] gained strength among cotton and wheat farmers, as well as coal miners, but was overtaken by the even more popular [[Free Silver]] movement, which demanded using silver to enlarge the money supply, leading to inflation that the silverites promised would end the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Worth Robert Miller, &quot;A Centennial Historiography of American Populism,&quot; ''Kansas History'' (1993) 16#1 pp 54-69. [http://history.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/texts/historiography.htm online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The financial, railroad and business communities fought back hard, arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy. In the most intense election in the nation's history, conservative Republican [[William McKinley]] defeated silverite [[William Jennings Bryan]], who ran on the Democratic, Populist and Silver Republican tickets. Bryan swept the South and West, but McKinley ran up landslides among the middle class, industrial workers, cities, and among upscale farmers in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Harpine|title=From the Front Porch to the Front Page: McKinley and Bryan in the 1896 Presidential Campaign|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0LANgsuVoBwC|year= 2006|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|pages=176–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosperity returned under McKinley, and the gold standard was enacted and the tariff was raised. By 1900 the U.S. had the strongest economy on the globe. Apart from two short recessions (in 1907 and 1920) the overall economy remained prosperous and growing until 1929. Republicans, citing McKinley's policies, took the credit.&lt;ref&gt;H. Wayne Morgan, &quot;William McKinley as a Political Leader,&quot; ''Review of Politics'' (1966) 28#4 pp. 417-432 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405280 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressive Era==
{{Main|Progressive Era}}
Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic [[Progressive Movement]] starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change.  Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] on the Republican side, and [[William Jennings Bryan]] on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was [[Jane Addams]] of Chicago.  Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments—the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth]] through [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]]—resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital history progressive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Learn About the Progressive Era|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/progressivism/index.cfm|work=Digital History|publisher=[[University of Houston]]|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–1918.&lt;ref&gt;George Mowry, ''The Era of Theodore Roosevelt and the Birth of Modern America, 1900–1912'' (Harpers, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism===
{{Further|American imperialism}}
The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after 1890. The main episode was the [[Spanish–American War]], which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Paterson. &quot;United States Intervention in Cuba, 1898: Interpretations of the Spanish–American–Cuban–Filipino War,&quot; ''The History Teacher'' (1996) 29#3 pp. 341–361 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/494551 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;splendid little war&quot;, as one official called it, involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] peace conference the United States acquired the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;Fred H. Harrington,  &quot;The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898–1900,&quot; ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1935) 22#2 pp. 211–230 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1898467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage.  Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved controversial.  William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as [[American imperialism|imperialism]] unbecoming to American democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt;  President [[William McKinley]] defended the acquisition, and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war.  McKinley easily defeated Bryan in a rematch in the [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, &quot;Was the Presidential Election of 1900 a Mandate on Imperialism?&quot; ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1937)  24#1 pp 43–52 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1891336 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating an [[Philippine–American War|insurrection by Filipino nationalists]], the United States engaged in a large-scale program to modernize the economy of the Philippines, and dramatically upgrade the public health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Stanley, ''A Nation in the Making: The Philippines and the United States, 1899–1921'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1908, however, Americans lost interest in an empire, and turned their international attention to the Caribbean, and especially the building of the [[Panama Canal]]. The canal opened in 1914, and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East. A key innovation was the [[Open Door Policy]], whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with no one of them allowed to take control of China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Jensen, Jon Thares Davidann, and Yoneyuki Sugital, eds. Trans-Pacific relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the twentieth century (Greenwood, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
{{main|American entry into World War I|United States home front during World War I}}
[[File:Cimetière américain de Romagne-sous-Montfaucon - 1918 - France.JPG|right|thumb|[[Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial|American Cemetery at Romagne-sous-Montfaucon]]]]
As [[World War I]] raged in Europe from 1914, President Woodrow Wilson took full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning Germany that resumption of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against American ships supplying goods to Allied nations would mean war. Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies to Britain; the U.S. declared war in April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=World War I: Encyclopedia |editors=Roberts, Priscilla Mary and Spencer Tucker |title=Germany's Decision for Unrestricted Submarine Warfare and Its Impact on the U.S. Declaration of War |last=McNabb |first=James B. |pages=482–483 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO  |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA482 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American money, food and munitions arrived quickly, but troops had to be drafted, trained; by summer 1918 American soldiers under General [[John J. Pershing]] arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, while Germany was unable to replace its losses.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The result was  [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory in November 1918. President Wilson demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the [[Fourteen Points]]. Wilson dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new [[League of Nations]]. Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's suffrage===
{{Further|Women's suffrage in the United States}}
[[Image:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Alice Paul stands before the Woman Suffrage Amendment's ratification banner.|[[Alice Paul]] wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], whose passage became an unachieved goal of the feminist movement in the 1970s]]

The [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]] began with the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]], organized by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]], and the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] demanding equal rights for women. Many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The women's rights campaign during &quot;[[first-wave feminism]]&quot; was led by Mott, Stanton, [[Susan B. Anthony]], among many others.  The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca J. Mead, ''How the Vote Was Won: Woman Suffrage in the Western United States, 1868–1914'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenda Riley 2001&quot;&gt;Glenda Riley, ''Inventing the American Woman: An Inclusive History'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1912 the [[feminist movement]], which had grown sluggish, began to reawaken, putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women, because men could not do that job.&lt;ref&gt;Aileen S. Kraditor, ''The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement: 1890–1920'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;  Protests became increasingly common as suffragette [[Alice Paul]] led parades through the capital and major cities. Paul split from the large [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], and formed the more militant [[National Woman's Party]].  Suffragists were arrested during their &quot;[[Silent Sentinels]]&quot; pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as [[political prisoner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams and Michael L. Keene, ''Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserve the right to vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I.  Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote.  Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success.  The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1919 and women could vote in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Frost-Knappman and Kathryn Cullen-Dupont, ''Women's Suffrage in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

NAWSA became the [[League of Women Voters]] and the National Woman's Party began lobbying for full equality and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in 1972. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Dumenil, ''The Modern Temper: American Culture and Society in the 1920s'' (1995)  pp 98–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristi Andersen, ''After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics before the New Deal'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect [[Al Smith]], a Catholic from New York City. Meanwhile Protestants mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan J.

In the 1920s the U.S. grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power. The United States Senate did not ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] imposed by its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] on the defeated [[Central Powers]]; instead, the United States chose to pursue [[unilateralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feature: World War I and isolationism, 1913–33|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1584/is_n17_v2/ai_11173912/ |publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=1991-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftershock of Russia's [[October Revolution]] resulted in real fears of communism in the United States, leading to a [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] and the deportation of aliens considered subversive.

In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]]. [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] encouraged illegal breweries and dealers to make substantial amounts of money selling alcohol illegally. The Prohibition ended in 1933, a failure. Additionally, the [[KKK]] re-formed during that decade and gathered nearly 4.5 million members by 1924, and the U.S. government passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] restricting foreign immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zinn|2003|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1920s were also known as the [[Roaring Twenties]], due to the great economic prosperity during this period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[Jazz]] became popular among the younger generation, and thus was also called the [[Jazz Age]].

===Great Depression and New Deal===
{{Further|Great Depression|New Deal}}

[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''Migrant Mother'' depicts destitute pea pickers in California, centering on [[Florence Owens Thompson]], a mother of seven, age 32, in [[Nipomo, California]], March 1936.]]
The Great depression (1929–39) and the New Deal (1933–36) were decisive moments in American political, economic and social history that reshaped the nation.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive history by a leading scholar see David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble was fueled by an inflated [[stock market]], which later led to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]] on October 29, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shlaes|2008|pp=85, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with [[causes of the Great Depression|many other economic factors]], triggered a worldwide [[economic depression|depression]] known as the [[Great Depression]]. During this time, the United States experienced [[deflation (economics)|deflation]] as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.

In 1932, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promised &quot;a [[New Deal]] for the American people&quot;, coining the enduring label for his domestic policies.  The desperate economic situation, along with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections, gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the &quot;First Hundred Days&quot; of his administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system, stock market, industry and agriculture, along with many other government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy. The New Deal regulated much of the economy, especially the financial sector. It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and (for young men) the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. Roosevelt turned left in 1935–36, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for FDR in 1936, 1940 and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Some of the programs were dropped in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, &quot;What the New Deal Did,&quot; ''Political Science Quarterly,'' (Summer 2009) 124#2 pp 251–268&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|right|The Japanese hoped to cripple American naval power in the Pacific with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], a naval base in Hawaii.]]

In the Depression years the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] militarized to and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started [[World War II]]. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the &quot;[[Arsenal of Democracy]]&quot; pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies—but no soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648–82&lt;/ref&gt; Japan tried to neutralize America's power in the Pacific by [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, which catalyzed American support to enter the war and seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944–45), soldiers. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the  war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked. It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence it was only &quot;for the duration&quot; and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II'' (1988) pp 27–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945'' (2001) pp 615–68&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tarawa beach HD-SN-99-03001.JPEG|thumb|American corpses sprawled on the beach of [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], November 1943.]]
The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]—the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union, as well as China, Canada and other countries—fought the [[Axis powers]] of Germany, Italy, and Japan.  The Allies saw Germany as the main threat, and gave highest priority to Europe. The U.S. dominated the war against Japan, and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942.  After losing to the Japanese Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines, and drawing the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the [[North African Campaign]] that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France from Britain.

[[File:Into the Jaws of Death 23-0455M edit.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Into the Jaws of Death]]'': The [[Normandy landings]] began the Allied march toward Germany from the west.]]

On the [[United States home front during World War II|home front]], mobilization of the U.S. economy was managed by Roosevelt's [[War Production Board]].  The wartime production boom led to full employment, wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression.  Indeed, [[labor shortage]]s encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers, finding new roles for women and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear'' (1999) pp 615–668&lt;/ref&gt;

However the fervor also inspired [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese sentiment]], which responded by [[Japanese American internment|removing everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast war zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Daniels, ''Prisoners Without Trial: Japanese Americans in World War II'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research and development]] took flight as well, best seen in the [[Manhattan Project]], a secret effort to harness [[nuclear fission]] to produce highly destructive [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rhodes, ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied pushed the Germans out of France, but faced an unexpected counterattack at the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December. The final German effort failed, and as 1945 opened Allied armies in East and West were converging on Berlin, as the Nazis hurriedly tried to kill the last remaining Jews. The western front stopped short, leaving Berlin to the Soviets as the Nazi regime formally capitulated in May 1945, ending the war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ambrose, ''Eisenhower and Berlin, 1945: The Decision to Halt at the Elbe'' 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Over in the Pacific, the U.S. implemented an [[leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping strategy]] toward Tokyo, establishing airfields for bombing runs against mainland Japan from the [[Mariana Islands]] and achieving hard-fought victories at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Spector, ''Eagle Against the Sun'' (1985) ch 12–18&lt;/ref&gt; Bloodied at Okinawa, the U.S. prepared to invade Japan's home islands when B-29's dropped [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombs on Japanese cities]], forcing the empire's surrender in a matter of days and thus ending World War II.&lt;ref&gt;D.

Giangreco, ''Hell to Pay: Operation DOWNFALL and the Invasion of Japan, 1945–1947'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupied Japan (and part of Germany), sending [[Douglas MacArthur]] to restructure the Japanese economy and political system along American lines.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Finn, ''Winners in Peace: MacArthur, Yoshida, and Postwar Japan'' (1992) pp 43–103&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf |title=American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and Statistics |publisher=Congressional Research Service |last=Leland |first=Anne |last2=Oboroceanu |first2=Mari–Jana |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-18}} p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the mainland prospered untouched by the devastation of war that inflicted a heavy toll on Europe and Asia.

Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant American isolationism. The awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired both [[nuclear power debate|optimism]] and [[mutual assured destruction|fear]].  Nuclear weapons were never used after 1945, as both sides drew back from the brink and a &quot;long peace&quot; characterized the [[Cold War]] years, 1947–1991. There were, however, regional wars in Korea and Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 1989&quot;&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cold War begins (1945–1964)==
{{Main|History of the United States (1945–1964)}}

[[Image:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s [[Civil Rights Address]], June 11, 1963.]]

Following World War II, the United States emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers, the [[USSR]] being the other. The [[U.S. Senate]] on a bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations (UN), which marked a turn away from the traditional [[isolationism]] of the U.S. and toward increased international involvement.

The primary American goal of 1945–48 was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the [[Soviet Union]].  The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans.  In 1948, the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive [[Marshall Plan]], which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 2005&quot;&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plan's $13 billion budget was in the context of a U.S. GDP of $258 billion in 1948, and was on top of $12 billion in American aid to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state [[Joseph Stalin]] prevented [[Eastern Bloc|his satellite states]] from participating, and from that point on Eastern Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity. In 1949, the United States, rejecting the long-standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance, which continues into the 21st century. In response the Soviets formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] of communist states.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 2005&quot;/&gt;

In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby escalating the risk of warfare. Indeed, the threat of [[mutually assured destruction]] prevented both powers from going too far, and resulted in [[proxy war]]s, especially in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], in which the two sides did not directly confront each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 1989&quot;/&gt;  Within the United States, the Cold War prompted concerns about [[Second Red Scare|Communist influence]]. The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with [[Sputnik]], the first Earth satellite, began the [[Space Race]], won by the Americans as [[Apollo 11]] landed astronauts on the moon in 1969. The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to large-scale federal support for [[Science education#United States|science education]] and research.&lt;ref&gt;James  T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after World War II, the United States became a global influence in economic, political, military, cultural, and technological affairs. Beginning in the 1950s, middle-class culture became obsessed with consumer goods. [[White Americans]] made up nearly 90% of the population in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab01.pdf |title=Table 1.

In [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], the charismatic politician [[John F. Kennedy]] was elected as the first and—thus far—only Roman Catholic President of the United States.  The Kennedy family brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the [[White House]]. His time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the United States' role in the [[Space Race]]; escalation of the American role in the [[Vietnam War]]; the [[Cuban missile crisis]]; the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]; the jailing of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] during the [[Birmingham campaign]]; and the appointment of his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to his Cabinet as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963, leaving the nation in profound shock.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Brien, ''John F. Kennedy: A Biography'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climax of liberalism==
The climax of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] came in the mid-1960s with the success of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963–69) in securing congressional passage of his [[Great Society]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alterman and Kevin Mattson, ''The Cause: The Fight for American Liberalism from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  They included civil rights, the end of [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], extension of welfare, federal aid to education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities, environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dallek, ''Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Bernstein, ''Guns or Butter: The Presidency of Lyndon Johnson'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; As recent historians have explained:
:&quot;Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to fast and class passions or redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Edwin Harrell|David Edwin Harrell, Jr.]], Edwin S. Gaustad, John B. Boles, Sally Foreman Griffith, Randall M. Miller, Randall B. Woods, ''Unto a Good Land: A History of the American People'' (2005) pp 1052–53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RFK and MLK together.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], June 22, 1963, Washington, D.C.]]
Johnson was rewarded with an [[United States presidential election, 1964|electoral landslide in 1964]] against conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], which broke the decades-long control of Congress by the [[Conservative coalition]]. But the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; conservative reaction would come with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Schneider, The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution (Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2009) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion. At the same time, institutionalized [[racism in the United States|racism across the United States]], but especially in the [[Southern United States|South]], was increasingly challenged by the growing [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights movement]]. The activism of African American leaders [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] led to the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], which launched the movement. For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them, but would achieve great steps towards equality with Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], which ended the [[Jim Crow laws]] that legalized [[racial segregation]] between Whites and Blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''The Civil Rights Movement'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cesar chavez2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Duncan West speaking with [[Cesar Chavez]]. Duncan represented the [[Teamsters]].]]

Martin Luther King, Jr., who had won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to achieve equality of the races, was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated in 1968]]. Following his death others led the movement, most notably King's widow, [[Coretta Scott King]], who was also active, like her husband, in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War]], and in the [[Feminist Movement in the United States|Women's Liberation Movement]]. Over the first nine months of 1967, 128 American cities suffered 164 [[riot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Zeitz. [http://www.americanheritage.com/events/articles/web/20070723-detroit-riots-1967-housing-african-american.shtml &quot;Why Did America Explode in Riots in 1967?&quot;]. ''AmericanHeritage.com''. July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise and fall of [[Black Power]], however the decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration, especially in government service, sports, and entertainment. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] turned to the courts to fight for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal government's failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken Native American groups was the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM). In the 1960s, [[Cesar Chavez]] began organizing poorly paid [[Mexican-American]] farm workers in California. He led a five-year-long strike by grape pickers. Then Chavez formed the nation's first successful union of farm workers. It later became the [[United Farm Workers of America]] (UFW).

===The Women's Movement===
{{Further|Second-wave feminism}}
[[File:Gloria Steinem at news conference, Women's Action Alliance, January 12, 1972.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Gloria Steinem]] at a meeting of the [[Women's Action Alliance]], 1972.]]

A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of [[Betty Friedan]]'s best-seller, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', which explained how many [[homemakers|housewives]] felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the [[National Organization for Women]], or NOW, to act for women as the [[NAACP]] did for African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenda Riley 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Howard Zophy, ed. ''Handbook of American Women's History'' (2nd ed. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests began, and the new Women's Liberation Movement grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U.S.'s main social revolution. Marches, parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands, sometimes millions; Friedan's [[Women's Strike for Equality]] (1970) was a nation-wide success. The Movement was split into factions by political ideology early on, however (with NOW on the left, the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL) on the right, the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] (NWPC) in the center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left).

Along with Friedan, [[Gloria Steinem]] was an important feminist leader, co-founding the NWPC, the [[Women's Action Alliance]], and editing the Movement's magazine, ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' The proposed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the Constitution, passed by Congress in 1972 and favored by about seventy percent of the American public, failed to be ratified in 1982, with only three more states needed to make it law. The nation's conservative women, led by activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]], defeated the ERA by arguing that it degraded the position of the housewife, and made young women susceptible to the [[conscription in the United States|military draft]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Critchlow, ''Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman's Crusade'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane J. Mansbridge, ''Why We Lost the ERA'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many federal laws (i.e. those equalizing [[Equal Pay Act|pay]], [[Title VII|employment]], [[Title IX|education]], [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act|employment opportunities]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|credit]], [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act|ending pregnancy discrimination]], and requiring [[NASA]], the [[Military Academies]], and other organizations to admit women), state laws (i.e. those ending [[spousal abuse]] and [[spousal rape|marital rape]]), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling the equal protection clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] applied to women), and state ERAs established women's equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women's equality. The controversial issue of abortion, deemed by the Supreme Court as a [[fundamental right]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), is still a [[abortion debate|point of debate]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Critchlow, ''Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Counterculture Revolution and Cold War Détente (1964–1980)==
{{Main|History of the United States (1964–1980)}} &lt;!-- This section and the &quot;Climax of liberalism&quot; section significantly overlap in coverage. --&gt;
Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the [[Vietnam War]], whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including those among women, minorities and young people. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] social programs and numerous rulings by the [[Warren Court]] added to the wide range of social reform during the 1960s and 1970s. Feminism and the environmental movement became political forces, and progress continued toward [[civil rights]] for all Americans. The [[counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture Revolution]] swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing Americans in a &quot;culture war&quot; but also bringing forth more liberated social views.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Voices, and Viewpoints'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:F-4B VF-151 CV-41 TU-95.jpg|right|thumb|United States Navy [[F-4 Phantom II]] shadows a Soviet [[Tu-95 Bear]] D aircraft in the early 1970s]]
Johnson was succeeded in 1969 by Republican [[Richard Nixon]], who turned the war over to the South Vietnamese forces and ended American combat roles; he negotiated a [[Paris Peace Accords|peace treaty in 1973]], secured the release of POWs and ended the draft. The war had cost the lives of 58,000 American troops. Nixon manipulated the fierce distrust between the Soviet Union and China to the advantage of the United States, achieving ''[[détente]]'' (cooperation) with both parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Robert Greene 1995&quot;&gt;John Robert Greene, ''The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Watergate scandal]], involving Nixon's cover-up of his operatives break-in into the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] destroyed his political base, sent many aides to prison, and forced Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Gerald Ford]], who was subsequently helpless to prevent the conquest of South Vietnam when North Vietnam invaded in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Robert Greene 1995&quot;/&gt;

The [[1973 oil crisis|OPEC oil embargo]] marked a long-term economic transition, as for the first time energy prices skyrocketed and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy crisis]], slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term [[stagflation]] was coined). While economists agreed on the wisdom of [[deregulation]], many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, as in transportation, banking and telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Derthick, ''The Politics of Deregulation'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Carter]], running as someone who was not a part of the Washington political establishment, was elected president in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/peopleevents/e_1976.html |title=People &amp; Events: The Election of 1976 |work=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the world stage, Carter brokered the [[Camp David Accords]] between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. With the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]] to the Republican [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urofsky |first=Melvin I. |title=The American Presidents |year=2000 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-2184-2 |page=545 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DBa6WQ5XCowC&amp;pg=PA545}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/1/20 |title=Jan 20, 1981: Iran Hostage Crisis ends |work=This Day in History |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]] produced a major [[realigning election|realignment]] with his [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] landslide elections. Reagan's economic policies (dubbed &quot;[[Reaganomics]]&quot;) and the implementation of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]] lowered income taxes from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=0 |title= Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979–2001 | publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis | date = July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. experienced a recession in 1982 but the negative indicators reversed, as the inflation rate decreased from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreased from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miseryindex.us/urbymonth.asp |title=The United States Unemployment Rate |publisher=Miseryindex.us |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the economic growth rate increased from 4.5% to 7.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the U.S. military, incurring a costly budget deficit. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot; by opponents) in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space. Though it was never fully developed or deployed, the Soviets were genuinely concerned about the possible effects of the program and became more willing to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian E. Zelizer|title=Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security--From World War II to the War on Terrorism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r_gH5s4B2SEC&amp;pg=PA300|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|pages=300–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's [[rollback]] policy of weakening Communist states in critical regions involved covert funding and assistance to [[anti-Communist]] resistance movements worldwide. Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the U.S., though his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in the controversy over the [[Iran–Contra affair]] that revealed Reagan's poor management style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ehrman|author2=Michael W. Flamm|title=Debating the Reagan Presidency|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CNtNj1oJnXEC|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=101–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan met four times with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]]. Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; then by shedding the East European empire in 1989. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, ending the U.S.–Soviet [[Cold War]].

==World superpower (1991–present)==
{{Main|History of the United States (1991–present)}}

[[File:Nasdaq Composite dot-com bubble.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[NASDAQ Composite]] index swelled with the [[dot-com bubble]] in the optimistic &quot;[[New Economy]]&quot;. The bubble burst in 2000.]]

The United States emerged as the world's sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the 1990s, including the 1991 [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]]. Following [[United States presidential election, 1992|his election in 1992]], President [[Bill Clinton]] oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values, a side effect of the [[digital revolution]] and new business opportunities created by the Internet. He also worked with the Republican Congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilentz 2008 400&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the House of Representatives on charges of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; for lying about a sexual relationship with White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]], but was later acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the 1998 election forced House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], a Republican, to resign from Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilentz 2008 400&quot;/&gt;

The [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election in 2000]] between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] was one of the closest in U.S. history, and helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come. The vote in the decisive state of Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic  [[Florida election recount|dispute over the counting of votes]]. The U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' ended the recount with a 5–4 vote. That meant Bush, then in the lead, carried Florida and the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=420–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===9/11 and the War on Terror===
[[Image:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|The [[September 11 attacks]] led to the [[War on Terror]].]]

On September 11, 2001 (9/11), the United States was struck by a [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attack]] when 19 [[al-Qaeda]] hijackers commandeered four airliners and intentionally crashed into both twin towers of the [[World Trade Center]] and into [[the Pentagon]], killing nearly 3000 people, mostly civilians.&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, ''The 9/11 Commission Report'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  In response on September 20, President [[George W. Bush]] announced a &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot;. On October 7, 2001, the United States and NATO then [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invaded Afghanistan]] to oust the [[Taliban]] regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and its leader [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Sanger, ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power'' (2012) ch 1, 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. The controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]] increased government's power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services.  A cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was created to lead and coordinate federal [[counter-terrorism]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Julian E. Zelizer, ed. ''The Presidency of George W. Bush: A First Historical Assessment'' (2010) pp 59–87&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these anti-terrorism efforts, particularly the U.S. government's handling of detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, led to allegations toward the U.S. government of human rights violations.  President Obama forbade torture, but in general retained Bush's policy regarding the Guantanamo detainees.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald, &quot;Obama’s new executive order on Guantanamo: The president again bolsters the Bush detention regime he long railed against,&quot; [http://www.salon.com/2011/03/08/guantanamo_17/ ''Salon'' March 8, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the United States launched [[2003 invasion of Iraq|an invasion of Iraq]], which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], with whom the U.S. had long-standing tense relations. The reasons for the invasion cited by the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy, the elimination of [[weapons of mass destruction]]&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, ed. ''The Presidency of George W. Bush: A First Historical Assessment'' (2010) pp 88–113&lt;/ref&gt; (a key demand of the UN as well, though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CIA's final report: No WMD found in Iraq |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/ |publisher=MSNBC |agency=Associated Press |date=2005-04-25 |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liberation of the Iraqi people. Despite some initial successes early in the invasion, the continued [[Iraq War]] fueled [[protests against the Iraq War|international protests]] and gradually saw [[popular opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq|domestic support decline]] as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clifton |first=Eli |url=http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/11/07/362734/poll-62-percent-say-iraq-war-wasnt-worth-fighting/ |title=Poll: 62 Percent Say Iraq War Wasn't Worth Fighting |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060700296.html |title=Poll Finds Dimmer View of Iraq War |work=Washington Post |date=2005-06-08 |accessdate=2010-10-10 |last=Milbank |first=Dana |last2=Deane |first2=Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after years of violence by the [[Iraqi insurgency]], President Bush deployed more troops in a strategy dubbed &quot;[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|the surge]]&quot;.  While the death toll decreased, the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, along with the [[2008 financial crisis]], led to the election of [[Barack Obama]], the first African American President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;William Crotty, &quot;Policy and Politics: The Bush Administration and the 2008 Presidential Election,&quot; ''Polity'' (2009) 41#3 pp 282–311  doi:10.1057/pol.2009.3;&lt;/ref&gt; 

As president, Obama officially ended combat operations in Iraq on August 31, 2010, but kept 50,000 in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces, help protect withdrawing forces, and work on counter-terrorism. In December 2011, the war was declared formally over and the last troops left the country.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News, &quot;'The war is over': Last US soldiers leave Iraq,&quot; [http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/18/9528197-the-war-is-over-last-us-soldiers-leave-iraq?lite MSNBC Dec. 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the same time, Obama increased American involvement in Afghanistan, starting a surge strategy using an additional 30,000 troops, while proposing to begin withdrawing troops at a later point. 

In May 2011, after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda [[Osama bin Laden]] was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted by U.S. naval special forces acting under President Obama's direct orders. While Al Qaeda was near collapse in Afghanistan, affiliated organizations continued to operate in Yemen and other remote areas, as the CIA used drones to hunt down and remove its leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Helene | last2=Cooper | first3=Mark | last3=Mazzetti | title=Bin Laden Is Dead, Obama Says | date=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter L.

=== Events since 2007 ===
[[File:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Lehman Brothers]] (headquarters pictured) filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 at the height of the U.S. [[financial crisis (2007–present)|financial crisis]].]]

In December 2007, the United States, and most of Europe, entered the longest post–World War II [[late-2000s recession|recession]]. Major problems included a [[United States housing market correction|housing market crisis]], a [[subprime mortgage crisis]], [[2000s energy crisis|soaring oil prices]], an [[effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|automotive industry crisis]], rising unemployment, and the worst [[financial crisis (2007–present)|financial crisis]] since the [[Great Depression]]. The financial crisis hit a critical point in September 2008 when [[Lehman Brothers]] and other important financial institutions failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert W.

Shortly after taking office, President Obama signed into law a [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|$787 billion economic stimulus package]] aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession.  In addition to the economic stimulus, the government took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns.  These included a bailout of [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the &quot;[[cash for clunkers]]&quot; program which temporarily boosted new car sales.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rattner, ''Overhaul: An Insider's Account of the Obama Administration's Emergency Rescue of the Auto Industry'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress enacted the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], a bill that makes sweeping changes to the financial regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mortgageorb.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.9199 | title= Most Voters Want Full Implementation Of Dodd-Frank |date=2011-07-11 | accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the recession officially ended and the U.S. economy began to expand once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68J2JJ20100920 |title=Recession ended in June 2009: NBER |agency=Reuters |date=2010-09-20 |first=Emily |last=Kaiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate peaked at 10.1% in October, followed by a slow economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasdaq.com/article/feds-pianalto-us-seeing-painfully-slow-economic-recovery-201110201314dowjonesdjonline000604&lt;/ref&gt;  

The beginning of the 2010s saw the rise of new political movements across the world, such as the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Tea Party movement]] in the U.S., the international populist [[Occupy movement]] and the pro-democratic [[Arab Spring|Arab Spring movement]] in the Middle East. The [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] saw the passage of major legislation such as the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce S. Jansson|title=The Reluctant Welfare State: Engaging History to Advance Social Work Practice in Contemporary Society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WSRALTDECQ4C&amp;pg=PA466|year= 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]], which were signed into law by President Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert P.

In the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans regained control of the House and installed [[John Boehner]] as Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Abramson et al. ''Change and Continuity in the 2008 and 2010 Elections'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The newly divided Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not raise the debt ceiling, extending tax cuts for citizens making less than $250,000 annually, and many other key issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By |url=http://www.investorplace.com/2011/12/congress-ends-2011-mired-in-gridlock/ |title=Congress Ends 2011 Mired in Gridlock |publisher=InvestorPlace |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress, their approval rating fell to an all time low of 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Seth Fiegerman |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11353209/1/congress-approval-rating-hits-all-time-low.html |title=Congress' Approval Rating Hits All-Time Low |publisher=TheStreet |date=2011-12-21 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama was [[United States presidential election, 2012|reelected in November 2012]] as the country was recovering from record draught over the summer and the massive [[Hurricane Sandy]] disrupted population centers in New York and New Jersey in late October. Partisan debates centered on the economy, the near-8% unemployment rate, economic inequality, deficit spending,  the financial crisis in state government, the role of public sector labor unions, health care, and abortion. Some $6 billion was spent on the election, but there was no change in the White House and little change in Congress, where the GOP controls the House and the Democrats the Senate. Attention immediately turned to the &quot;[[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]&quot;: starting January 1, 2013, current law calls for automatic spending cuts (&quot;sequestration&quot;) and tax increases totalling nearly $900 billion in 2013. Most analysts fear the impact on the economy will be severe unless Washington acts quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Masters, &quot;What Is the Fiscal Cliff?&quot; [http://www.cfr.org/economics/fiscal-cliff/p28757 Council on Foreign Relations, Aug. 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- New content should be added first to [[History of the United States (1991–present)]]. Human rights, environmental protection, foreign trade, and other issues rarely are covered by mainstream media as the &quot;debt crisis&quot; and Tea Party political agenda have now taken center stage.--&gt;
