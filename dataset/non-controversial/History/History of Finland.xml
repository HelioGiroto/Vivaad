The land area that now makes up [[Finland]] was probably settled immediately after the last [[ice age]] (pre- ice age human life has now been shown to exist in the modern area of Finland as well), which ended c. 9000 BCE. Most of the region was a part of the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] from the 13th century to 1809, when the vast majority of the Finnish-speaking areas of Sweden were ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] (excluding the [[Meänkieli|Finnish-speaking]] areas of the modern-day Northern Sweden), making this area the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. The Lutheran religion dominated. Finnish nationalism emerged, focused on Finnish cultural traditions, including music and - especially - the highly distinctive language and lyrics associated with it.  The catastrophic [[Finnish famine of 1866–1868]] was followed by eased economic regulations and extensive emigration. 

In 1917, Finland declared independence. A civil war between the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] ensued a few months later, with the &quot;Whites&quot; gaining the upper hand during the springtime of 1918. After the internal affairs stabilized, the still mainly agrarian economy grew relatively fast. Relations with the West, especially Sweden and Britain, were strong but tensions remained with the Soviet Union.  During the Second World War, Finland fought twice against the Soviet Union and defended its independence, though in the process it in the 1947 peace settlement ended up ceding a large part of [[Karelia]] and some other areas to the [[Soviet Union]]. However, Finland remained an independent democracy in Western Europe. 

Later half of its independent history, Finland has maintained a [[mixed economy]]. Since its post-WW2 economic boom in the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita has been among the world's highest.  The expanded [[welfare state]] of Finland from 1970 and 1990 increased the public sector employees and spending and the tax burden imposed on the citizens. In 1992, Finland simultaneously faced economic overheating and depressed Western, Russian and local markets.  Finland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995. According to a 2005 poll, most of Finns at that point were reluctant to join NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1101978684236 |title=Article on Helsingin Sanomat in English |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistory==

===Paleolithic===
If confirmed, the oldest archeological site in Finland would be the [[Wolf Cave]] in [[Kristinestad]], in Ostrobothnia. Excavations are currently underway, and if the so far presented estimates hold true, the site would be the only pre-glacial ([[Neanderthal]]) site so far discovered in the [[Nordic Countries]], and it is approximately 125,000 years old [http://www.nba.fi/fi/susiluola].

===Mesolithic===
The last [[ice age]] in the area of the modern-day Finland ended c. 9000 BCE. Starting about that time, people migrated to the area of Finland from the [[Kunda culture|Kunda]] and - possibly - [[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] cultures, and they are believed to be ancestors of today's Finnish and Sami people in Finland.  

The oldest confirmed evidence of the post-glacial human settlements in Finland are from the area of Ristola in [[Lahti]] and from [[Orimattila]], from c. 8900 BCE. Finland has been continuously inhabited at least since the end of the last ice age, up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.fi/fi/skm_opetus_esihist_tietoa4 | title=Population Development on the Prehistoric Period ('Väestön kehitys esihistoriallisella ajalla') | julkaisupaikka = Helsinki| publisher=Finnish National Board of Antiquities | accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest post-glacial inhabitants of the present-day area of Finland were probably mainly seasonal [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Their artifacts discovered are known to represent the [[Suomusjärvi culture|Suomusjärvi]] and the [[Kunda culture|Kunda]] cultures.  Among finds is the [[net of Antrea]], the oldest fishing net known ever to have been excavated (calibrated carbon dating: c. 8300 BCE).

===Neolithic===
Around 5300 BCE, - provably - pottery was present in Finland. The earliest samples belong to the [[Comb Ceramic Culture]]s, known for their distinctive decorating patterns. This marks the beginning of the [[neolithic]] period for '''Finland''', although the subsistence was still based on hunting and fishing. Extensive networks of exchange existed across Finland and Northeastern Europe during the 5th millennium BCE. For example, flint from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Valdai Hills]], [[amber]] from Scandinavia and the [[Baltic region]] and [[slate]] from Scandinavia and [[Lake Onega]] found their ways into the Finnish archeological sites undes excavatons today and [[asbestos]] and [[soap stone]] from e.g. the area of [[Saimaa]] spread outside of Finland. Rock paintings - apparently related to shamanistic and totemistic belief systems - have been found, especially in Eastern Finland, e.g. [[Astuvansalmi]].  

From 3200 BCE onwards, either immigrants or a strong cultural influence from south of the [[Gulf of Finland]] settled in Southwestern Finland. This culture was a part of the European [[Battle Axe culture]]s, which have often been associated with the movement of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers. The Battle-Axe - or Cord Ceramic - culture seems to have practiced [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] outside of Finland, but the earliest confirmed traces of agriculture in Finland date later, approximately to the 2nd millennium BCE. Further inland, the societies retained their hunting-gathering lifestyles for the time being {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. 

The Battle axe and the Comb Ceramic cultures merged, giving rise to the [[Kiukainen culture]] which existed between 2300 BCE and 1500 BCE, featuring fundamentally a comb ceramic tradition with cord ceramic characteristics.

===Bronze Age===
The Bronze Age began some time after 1500 BCE. The coastal regions of Finland were a part of the Nordic Bronze Culture, whereas in the inland regions the influences came from the bronze-using cultures of Northern and Eastern Russia.

===Chronology of the Finno-Ugric, Finnic, Indo-European and Germanic languages in Finland===

The question of the time lines for the evolution and the spreading of the contemporary languages is controversial, and new theories challenging older postulations have been introduced continuously.

According to the recently most widespread presumption,&lt;ref&gt;Article by professor of History of Religions Juha Pentikäinen at Virtual Finland [http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25814]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QGqWcZu42hUC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=comb+ugric&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9uRgOFQWjO&amp;sig=Pkf9Kg0J7NZp04lWvU52SgUHeOM#PPA32,M1 |title=The Finno-Ugric republics and the ... - Rein Taagepera - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The common acceptance of the theory is indicated by the fact that this is the theory currently presented by the National Board of Antiquities in Finland, and several schools: E.g [http://www.nba.fi/fi/skm_opetus_esihist_tulost_0 Tietoa Suomen esihistoriasta]. Museovirasto. Retrieved 2008-03-20. {{fi}}, [http://hyl.edu.hel.fi/sivut/comenius/suomi/sfinfact.html SUOMEN ASUTUS- JA SIIRTOLAISUUSHISTORIA- PROJEKTI COMENIUS MIGRATION PROJEKTI]. City of Helsinki. Retrieved 2008-03-20. {{fi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finno-Ugric (or [[Uralic]]) languages were first spoken in Finland and the adjacent areas during the (typical) Comb Ceramic period, around 4000 BCE at the latest. During the 2nd millennium BCE these evolved – possibly under an Indo-European (most likely Baltic) influence – into proto-Sami (inland) and proto(-Baltic)-Finnic (coast). However, this theory has been increasingly contested among comparative linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Ante Aikio 2006: On Germanic-Saami contacts and Saami prehistory. – ''Journal de la Société Finno-Ougrienne'' 91: 9–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested instead that the Finno-Ugric languages arrived in Finland later, perhaps only during the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Petri Kallio 2006: Suomalais-ugrilaisen kantakielen absoluuttisesta kronologiasta. – ''Virittäjä'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish language is thought to have started to differentiate during the Iron Age starting from the 1st centuries AD onwards. 

Cultural influences from all points of the compass are visible in the Finnish archeological finds from the very first settlements onwards. E.g. archaeological finds from Finnish Lapland suggest the presence of the [[Komsa culture]]. The Sujala finds equal in age with the earliest Komsa-artefacts from Norway but may suggest also a connection to the [[Swiderian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;PEOPLE, MATERIAL CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE NORTH Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu, 18–23 August 2004 Edited by Vesa-Pekka Herva GUMMERUS KIRJAPAINO [http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514281411/isbn9514281411.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; South-Western Finland belonged to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], which may be associated with Indo-European languages and according to Finnish Germanist Jorma Koivulehto speakers of [[Proto-Germanic]] language in particular. Artefacts found in [[Uusikaupunki|Kalanti]] and the province of [[Satakunta]], for long monolingually Finnish, and their place-names have made several scholars argue for an existence of a proto-Germanic speaking population component a little later, during the Early and Middle Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/2002_309.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turunsanomat.fi/agricola/?ts=1,3:1121:0:0,4:121:2:1:2007-12-11,104:121:504183,1:0:0:0:0:0: Turun Sanomat]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Norse]]-speaking population settled parts of Finland's coastal areas in the 12th to 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folktinget.fi/pdf/publikationer/SwedishInF.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish language differentiated from the eastern Norse dialects by the 13th century. During the subsequent Swedish reign over Finland particularly the coastal areas witnessed waves of settlement from Sweden.

===Iron Age===

The [[Iron Age]] in Finland is considered to last from c.500 BC until c.1150 AD when the Swedish Conquest of Finland was complete and written history in Finland (the [[Middle Ages]]) begins. There is no evidence of any form of writing in Finland, [[rune]]s or otherwise, prior to the Swedish Conquest and all evidence regarding Finnish history prior to Swedish involvement is based on archaeological findings and the scant records of contemporaneous third parties. 

The three main dialectal groups of Finnish-speakers, (proper-)Finns, [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastians]] and [[Karelians]] probably emerged during the Iron Age. The archaeological culture of the [[Åland Islands]] had a more prominent Swedish character than the rest of the country,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} possibly suggesting Scandinavian settlement.

The earliest findings of imported iron blades and local iron working appear in 500 BC. From about 50 AD, there are indications of a more intense long-distance exchange of goods in coastal Finland. Inhabitants exchanged their products, presumably, mostly furs, for weapons and ornaments with the Balts and the Scandinavians as well as with the peoples along the traditional eastern trade routes. The existence of richly furnished burials, usually with weapons, suggests that there was a chiefly elite in southern and western parts of the country. [[Hillfort]]s spread over most of southern Finland at the end of the Iron and early Medieval Age. There is no commonly accepted evidence of early state formations in Finland, and the presumedly Iron Age origins of urbanisation are contested. 

In the early Iron Age a word similar to ''Finns'' appeared for the first time in a written document when [[Tacitus]] mentions ''Fenni'' in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. However, it is unclear if these have anything to do with the present Finnish people. The first Scandinavian documents mentioning a &quot;land of the Finns&quot; are two [[runestone]]s: ([[Söderby]], Sweden, with the inscription ''finlont'' ([[Rundata|U 582 †]]), [[Gotland]] with the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Rundata|G 319 M]]) dating from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/eng/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

[[Image:Gs 13, Gävle.jpg|100px|left|thumb|The [[Baltic expeditions runestones#Gs 13|runestone Gs 13]] documents an early 11th century Swedish Viking who died in Finland, perhaps during a raid.]]

Contact between Sweden and what is now Finland was considerable even during pre-Christian times – the [[Varangian|Vikings]] were known to Finns both due to their participation in commerce and plundering. There is commonly accepted evidence of Viking settlement in the Finnish mainland.&lt;ref&gt;[Viklund, K. &amp; Gullberg, K. (red.): ''Från romartid until vikingatid. Pörnullbacken – en järnålderstida bosättning i Österbotten'', Vasa, Scriptum, 2002, 264 pages. Series: ''Acta antiqua Ostrobotniensia'', ISSN 0783-6678 ; nr 5, and ''Studia archaeologica universitatis Umensis'', ISSN 1100-7028 ; nr 15, ISBN 951-8902-91-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Åland Islands probably had Swedish settlement during the Viking Period. However, some scholars claim that the archipelago was deserted during the 11th century. 
According to the archaeological finds, [[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century. According to the very few written documents that have survived, the church in Finland was still in its early development in the 12th century. Later medieval legends describe Swedish attempts to [[First Swedish Crusade|conquer and Christianize Finland]] sometime in the mid-1150s. In the early 13th century, [[Bishop Thomas]] became the first [[bishop of Finland]]. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finns under their rule. These were Sweden, Denmark, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] in Northwestern Russia and probably the German crusading orders as well. Finns had their own chiefs, but most probably no central authority. Russian chronicles indicate there were [[Finnish-Novgorodian Wars|conflict between Novgorod and the Finnic tribes]] from the 11th or 12th century to the early 13th century.

The name &quot;Finland&quot; originally signified only the southwestern province that has been known as &quot;[[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]]&quot; since the 18th century. [[Österland]] (lit. Eastern Land) was the original name for the Swedish realm's eastern part, but already in the 15th century Finland began to be used synonymously with Österland. The concept of a Finnish &quot;country&quot; in the modern sense developed only slowly during the period of the 15th&amp;ndash;18th centuries. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

It was the Swedish regent, [[Birger Jarl]], who established Swedish rule in Finland through the [[Second Swedish Crusade]], most often dated to 1249, which was aimed at Tavastians who had stopped being Christian again. Novgorod gained control in [[Karelia]], the region inhabited by speakers of Eastern Finnish dialects. &lt;!-- It has been argued that the Finnic peoples that came under Swedish rule were equally much different as they were compared to them who came under Novgorod's influence. --&gt;Sweden however gained the control of Western Karelia with the [[Third Finnish Crusade]] in 1293. Western Karelians were from then on viewed as part of the western cultural sphere, while eastern Karelians turned culturally to Russia and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]. While eastern Karelians remain linguistically and ethnically closely related to the Finns, they are considered a people of their own by most.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Thus, the northern border between Catholic and Orthodox Christendom came to lie at the eastern border of what would become Finland with the [[Treaty of Nöteborg]] in 1323. 

During the 13th century, Finland was integrated into medieval European civilization. The [[Dominican order]] arrived in Finland around 1249 and came to exercise huge influence there. In the early 14th century, the first documents of Finnish students at [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] appear. In the south-western part of the country, an urban settlement evolved in [[Turku]]. Turku was one of the biggest towns in the Kingdom of Sweden, and its population included German merchants and craftsmen. Otherwise the degree of urbanization was very low in medieval Finland. Southern Finland and the long coastal zone of the [[Gulf of Bothnia|Bothnian Gulf]] had a sparse farming settlement, organized as parishes and castellanies. In the other parts of the country a small population of [[Sami people|Sami]] hunters, fishermen and small-scale farmers lived. These were exploited by the Finnish and Karelian tax collectors. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the 12th and 13th centuries, great numbers of Swedish settlers moved to the southern and north-western coasts of Finland, to the [[Åland Islands]] and to the archipelago between Turku and the Åland Islands: in these regions, the Swedish language is widely spoken even today. Swedish came to be the language of the high-status people in many other parts of Finland as well. 

During the 13th century, the bishopric of Turku was established. The [[Turku Cathedral|cathedral of Turku]] was the center of the cult of [[Henry, Bishop of Uppsala|Saint Henry]], and naturally the cultural center of the bishopric. The bishop had the ecclesiastical authority over much of today's Finland and was usually the most powerful man there. Bishops were often Finns, whereas the commanders in the castles were more often Scandinavian or German noblemen. In 1362, representatives from Finland were called to participate in the elections for king of Sweden. That year is often held to signify the incorporation of Finland into the kingdom of Sweden. As in the Scandinavian part of the kingdom, a gentry or (lower) nobility consisted of magnates and yeomen who could afford armament for a man and a horse. These were concentrated in the southern part of Finland. 

The strong fortress of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Finnish: ''Viipuri'', Russian: ''Vyborg'') guarded the eastern border of Finland. Sweden and Novgorod signed the [[Treaty of Nöteborg]] (''Pähkinäsaari'' in Finnish) in 1323, but that would not last long. For example, in 1348 the Swedish king [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] staged a failed crusade against the Orthodox &quot;[[Christian heresy|heretic]]s&quot;, managing only to alienate his supporters and finally losing his crown. The bones of contention between Sweden and Novgorod were the northern coast-line of the Bothnian Gulf and the wilderness regions of [[Savo]] in Eastern Finlandied [[Novgorod]] considered these as hunting and fishing grounds of its Karelian subjects, protesting against the slow infiltration of Catholic settlers from the West. [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|Occasional raids and clashes between Swedes and Novgorodians]] occurred during the late 14th and 15th centuries, but for most of the time an uneasy peace prevailed. There existed internal tensions as well. During the 1380s a civil war in the Scandinavian part of Sweden brought unrest to Finland, too. The victor of this struggle was Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]], who brought the three Scandinavian kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Norway under her rule (the &quot;[[Kalmar Union]]&quot;) in 1389. The next 130 years or so were characterized by attempts of different Swedish factions to break out of the Union. Finland was sometimes involved in these struggles, but in general the 15th century seems to have been a relatively prosperous time{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, characterized by population growth and economic development. Towards the end of the 15th century, however, the situation on the eastern border was becoming more tense. The [[Principality of Moscow]] conquered Novgorod, preparing the way for a unified Russia, and soon tensions arose with Sweden. In 1495&amp;ndash;1497, [[Russo-Swedish War, 1496-1499|a war between Sweden and Russia was fought]]. The fortress-town of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] stood against a Russian siege: according to a contemporary legend, it was saved by a miracle.

==Peasants==
While the king of Sweden set in his governor to rule Finland, in day to day reality the villagers ran their own affairs using traditional local assemblies (called the ting) which selected a local a &quot;lagman&quot;, or lawman, to enforce the norms.  The Swedes used the parish system to collect taxes. The socken (local parish) was at once a community religious organization and a judicial district that administered the king's law. The ting participated in the taxation process; taxes were collected by the bailiff, a royal appointee.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Carr et al., ''Area Handbook for Finland'' (U.S. State Department, 1974) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to serfdom in Germany and Russia, the Finnish peasant was typically a freeholder who owned and controlled his small plot of land. There was no serfdom in which peasants were permanently attached to specific lands, and were ruled by the owners of that land. In Finland (and Sweden) the peasants formed one of the four estates and were represented in the parliament. Outside the political sphere, however, the peasants were considered at the bottom of the social order—just above vagabonds.  The upper classes looked down on them as excessively prone to drunkenness and laziness, as clannish and untrustworthy, and especially as lacking honor and a sense of national spirit. This disdain  dramatically changed in the 19th century when everyone idealized the peasant as the true carrier of Finnishness and the national ethos, as opposed to the Swedish-speaking elites.  

The peasants were not passive; they were proud of their traditions and would band together and fight to uphold their traditional rights in the face of burdensome taxes from the king or new demands by the landowning nobility.  The great &quot;Club War&quot; in the south in 1596-97 attacked the nobles and their new system of state feudalism; this bloody revolt was similar to other contemporary peasant wars in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmo Katajala, &quot;Okänd bonde&quot; ['The unknown peasant. The manifold faces of the peasantry from the middle ages to modern times'] ''Historisk Tidskrift,'' 2006, Issue 4, pp 791-801&lt;/ref&gt;  In the north, there was less tension between nobles and peasants and more equality among peasants, due to the practice of subdividing farms among heirs, to non farm economic activities, and to the small numbers of nobility and gentry. Often the nobles and landowners were paternalistic and helpful.  The Crown usually sided with the nobles, but after the &quot;restitution&quot; of the 1680s it ended the practice of the nobility extracting labor from the peasants and instead began a new tax system whereby royal bureaucrats collected taxes directly from the peasants, who dislike the efficient new system. After 1800 growing population pressure resulted in larger numbers of poor crofters and landless laborers and the impoverishment of small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Antti Kujala, ''The Crown, the Nobility and the Peasants 1630-1713: Tax, Rent and Relations of Power'' (Helsinki: Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th century==
[[File:Swedish Empire in Early Modern Europe (1560-1815).png|thumb|The [[Swedish empire]] at its largest. Most of present-day Finland was an integral part of the [[Sweden proper|Swedish homeland]], ''rike'', shown in dark green.]]In 1521 the Kalmar Union collapsed and [[Gustav Vasa]] became the King of Sweden. During his rule, the Swedish church was reformed (1527). The state administration underwent extensive reforms and development too, giving it a much stronger grip on the life of local communities – and ability to collect higher taxes. Following the policies of the Reformation, in 1551 [[Mikael Agricola]], bishop of Turku, published his translation of the [[New Testament]] into the [[Finnish language]].

In 1550 [[Helsinki]] was founded by [[Gustav Vasa]] under the name of Helsingfors, but remained little more than a fishing village for more than two centuries.

King Gustav Vasa died in 1560 and his crown was passed to his three sons in separate turns. King [[Erik XIV]] started an era of expansion when the Swedish crown took the city of [[Tallinn]] in [[Estonia]] under its protection in 1561. The [[Livonian War]] was the beginning of a warlike era which lasted for 160 years. In the first phase, Sweden fought for the lordship of Estonia and [[Latvia]] against Denmark, Poland and Russia. The common people of Finland suffered because of drafts, high taxes, and abuse by military personnel. This resulted in the [[Cudgel War]] of 1596–97, a desperate peasant rebellion, which was suppressed brutally and bloodily. A peace treaty (the [[Treaty of Teusina]]) with Russia in 1595 moved the border of Finland further to the east and north, very roughly where the modern border lies.

An important part of the 16th century history of Finland was growth of the area settled by the farming population. The crown encouraged farmers from the province of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] to settle the vast wilderness regions in Middle Finland. This was done, and the original [[Sami people|Sami]] population often had to leave. Some of the wilderness settled was traditional hunting and fishing territory of [[Karelia]]n hunters. During the 1580s, this resulted in a bloody guerrilla warfare between the Finnish settlers and Karelians in some regions, especially in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]].

==17th century – the Swedish Empire==
[[Image:Grand duchy of finland 1662.jpg|thumb|Map of Finland from 1662.]]
In 1611-1632 Sweden was ruled by King [[Gustavus Adolphus]], whose military reforms transformed the Swedish army from a peasant militia into an efficient fighting machine, possibly the best in Europe. The conquest of [[Livonia]] was now completed, and some territories were taken from internally divided Russia in the [[Treaty of Stolbova]]. In 1630, the Swedish (and Finnish) armies marched into Central Europe, as Sweden had decided to take part in the great struggle between Protestant and Catholic forces in Germany, known as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The Finnish light cavalry was known as the [[Hakkapeliitta|Hakkapeliitat]].

After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, the [[Swedish Empire]] was one of the most powerful countries in Europe. During the war, several important reforms had been made in Finland:
*1637–1640 and 1648–1654 Count [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] functioned as general governor of Finland. Many important reforms were made and many towns were founded. His period of administration is generally considered very beneficial to the development of Finland.
*1640 Finland's first university, the [[Academy of Åbo]], was founded in Turku at the proposal of Count Per Brahe by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]].
*1642 The whole [[Bible]] was published in Finnish. 
However, the high taxation, continuing wars and the cold climate (the [[Little Ice Age]]) made the Imperial era of Sweden rather gloomy times for Finnish peasants. In 1655–1660, the [[Northern Wars]] were fought, taking Finnish soldiers to the battle-fields of [[Livonia]], Poland and Denmark. In 1676, the political system of Sweden was transformed into an [[Charles XI of Sweden|absolute monarchy]]. 

In Middle and Eastern Finland, great amounts of [[tar]] were produced for export. European nations needed this material for the maintenance of their fleets. According to some theories, the spirit of early [[capitalism]] in the tar-producing province of [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] may have been the reason for the [[witch-hunt]] wave that happened in this region during the late 17th century. The people were developing more expectations and plans for the future, and when these were not realized, they were quick to blame witches – according to a belief system the [[Lutheran]] church had imported from Germany.

The Empire had a colony in the New World in the modern-day Delaware-Pennsylvania area between 1638–1655. At least half of the immigrants were of Finnish origin. 

The 17th century was an era of very strict [[Lutheran]] orthodoxy. In 1608, the law of Moses was declared the law of the land, in addition to secular legislation. Every subject of the realm was required to confess the Lutheran faith and church attendance was mandatory. Ecclesiastical penalties were widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saunalahti.fi/arnoldus/puu_jalk.html Forsius, A. Puujalka ja jalkapuu.] Cited 2006-12-14. In Finnish&lt;/ref&gt; The rigorous requirements of orthodoxy were revealed in the dismissal of the Bishop of Turku, Johan Terserus, who wrote a [[catechism]] which was decreed heretical in 1664 by the theologians of the Academy of Åbo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirjasto.jyu.fi/jyk/kokoelmat/julkaisut/kielletyt_kirjat/kotimaa.htm Jyväskylän yliopiston kirjasto. Kielletyt kirjat.] Cited 2006-12-14. In Finnish&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Lutheran requirement of the individual study of Bible prompted the first attempts at wide-scale education. The church required from each person a degree of literacy sufficient to read the basic texts of the Lutheran faith. Although the requirements could be fulfilled by learning the texts by heart, also the skill of reading became known among the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotisivu.mtv3.fi/suomenhistoria/historia/kirkko/rothovi.htm Suomen historia: kirkon historia] Cited 2006-12-14. In Finnish&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1696-1699, [[Great Famine of Finland (1695–1697)|a famine]] caused by climate decimated Finland. A combination of an early frost, the freezing temperatures preventing grain from reaching Finnish ports, and a lackluster response from the Swedish government saw about one-third of the population die.&lt;ref&gt;Jutikkala, Eino and Pirinen, Kauko. ''A History of Finland''. Dorset Press, 1988, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, another war determining Finland's fate began (the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700–21).

==18th century – the Age of Enlightenment==

===Wars===
The [[Great Northern War]] (1700&amp;ndash;1721) was devastating, as Sweden and Russia fought for control of the Baltic. Harsh conditions—worsening poverty and repeated crop failures—among peasants undermined support for the war, leading to Sweden's defeat.  Finland was a battleground as both armies ravaged the countryside, leading to famine, epidemics, social disruption and the loss of nearly half the population. By 1721 only 250,000 remained.&lt;ref&gt;Antti Kujala, &quot;The Breakdown of a Society: Finland in the Great Northern War 1700-1714,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' Mar-June 2000, Vol. 25 Issue 1/2, pp 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;  Landowners had to pay higher wages to keep their peasants. Russia was the winner, annexing the [[Old Finland|south-eastern part]], including the town of [[Vyborg|Viborg]], after the [[Treaty of Nystad]]. The border with Russia came to lie roughly where it returned to after World War II. Sweden's status as a European great power was forfeit, and Russia was now the leading power in the North. The absolute monarchy was ended in Sweden. During this [[Sweden and the Great Northern War#The Age of Liberty|Age of Liberty]], the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Parliament]] ruled the country, and the two parties of the [[Hats (party)|Hats]] and [[Caps (party)|Caps]] struggled for control leaving the lesser Court party, i.e. parliamentarians with close connections to the royal court, with little to no influence. The Caps wanted to have a peaceful relationship with Russia and were supported by many Finns, while other Finns longed for revenge and supported the Hats.

Finland by this time was depopulated, with a population in 1749 of 427,000. However with peace the population grew rapidly, and doubled before 1800. 90% of the population were typically classified as &quot;[[peasant]]s&quot;, most being free taxed yeomen. Society was divided into four Estates: peasants (free taxed yeomen), the clergy, nobility and burghers. A minority, mostly [[cottage]]rs, were estateless, and had no political representation. Forty-five percent of the male population were enfranchised with full political representation in the legislature – although clerics, nobles and townsfolk had their own chambers in the parliament, boosting their political influence and excluding the peasantry on matters of foreign policy.

The mid-18th century was a relatively good time, partly because life was now more peaceful. However, during the [[Lesser Wrath]] (1741&amp;ndash;1742), Finland was again occupied by the Russians after the government, during a period of Hat party dominance, had made a [[Hats' Russian War|botched attempt to reconquer]] the lost provinces. Instead the result of the [[Treaty of Åbo]] was that the Russian border was moved further to the west. During this time, Russian propaganda hinted at the possibility of [[Kingdom of Finland (1742)|creating a separate Finnish kingdom]]. 

Both the ascending Russian Empire and pre-revolutionary France aspired to have Sweden as a client state. Parliamentarians and others with influence were susceptible to taking bribes which they did their best to increase. The integrity and the credibility of the political system waned, and in 1771 the young and charismatic king [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] staged a [[coup d'état]], abolished [[parliamentarism]] and reinstated royal power in Sweden – more or less with the support of the parliament. In 1788, he started a new war against Russia. Despite a couple of [[Battle of Svensksund|victorious battles]], the war was fruitless, managing only to bring disturbance to the economic life of Finland. The popularity of King Gustav III waned considerably. During the war, a group of officers made the famous [[Anjala conspiracy|Anjala declaration]] demanding peace negotiations and calling of ''Riksdag'' (Parliament). An interesting sideline to this process was the conspiracy of some Finnish officers, who attempted to create an independent Finnish state with Russian support. After an initial shock, Gustav III crushed this opposition. In 1789, the new constitution of Sweden strengthened the royal power further, as well as improving the status of the peasantry. However, the continuing war had to be finished without conquests – and many Swedes now considered the king as a tyrant. 

With the interruption of the war (1788&amp;ndash;1790), the last decades of the 18th century had been an era of development in Finland. New things were changing even everyday life, such as starting of potato farming after the 1750s. New scientific and technical inventions were seen. The first hot air balloon in Finland (and in the whole Swedish kingdom) was made in Oulu (Uleåborg) in 1784, only a year after it was invented in France. Trade increased and the peasantry was growing more affluent and self-conscious. The [[Age of Enlightenment]]'s climate of broadened debate in the society on issues of politics, religion and morals would in due time highlight the problem that the overwhelming majority of Finns spoke only [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but the cascade of newspapers, belles-lettres and political leaflets was almost exclusively in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] – when not in [[French language|French]]. 

The two Russian occupations had been harsh and were not easily forgotten. These occupations were a seed of a feeling of separateness and otherness, that in a narrow circle of scholars and intellectuals at the university in [[Turku]] was forming a sense of a separate Finnish identity representing the eastern part of the realm. The shining influence of the Russian imperial capital [[Saint Petersburg]] was also much stronger in southern Finland than in other parts of Sweden, and contacts across the new border dispersed the worst fears for the fate of the educated and trading classes under a Russian régime. At the turn of the 19th to 20th century, the Swedish-speaking educated classes of officers, clerics and civil servants were mentally well prepared for a shift of allegiance to the strong [[Russian Empire]].

King Gustav III was assassinated in 1792, and his son [[Gustav IV Adolf]] assumed the crown after a period of [[Absolute Monarchy in Sweden#Reuterholm|regency]]. The new king was not a particularly talented ruler; at least not talented enough to steer his kingdom through the dangerous era of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic wars]].

Meanwhile, the Finnish areas belonging to Russia after the peace treaties in 1721 and 1743 (not including Ingria), called &quot;Old Finland&quot; were initially governed with the old Swedish laws (a not uncommon practice in the expanding Russian Empire in the 18th century). However, gradually the rulers of Russia granted large estates of land to their non-Finnish favorites, ignoring the traditional landownership and peasant freedom laws of Old Finland. There were even cases where the noblemen punished peasants corporally, for example by flogging.  The overall situation caused decline in the economy and morale in Old Finland, worsened since 1797 when the area was forced to send men to the Imperial Army. The construction of military installations in the area brought thousands of non-Finnish people to the region. In 1812, after the Russian conquest of Finland, &quot;Old Finland&quot; was rejoined to the rest of the country but the landownership question remained a serious problem until the 1870s.

==Russian Grand Duchy==
{{See also|Grand Duchy of Finland}}

During the [[Finnish War]] between Sweden and Russia, Finland was again conquered by the armies of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. The [[Riksdag of the Estates|four Estates]] of occupied Finland were assembled at the [[Diet of Finland|Diet of Porvoo]] on March 29, 1809 to pledge allegiance to [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Following the Swedish defeat in the war and the signing of the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] on September 17, 1809, Finland remained a [[Grand Duchy]] in the [[Russian Empire]] until the end of 1917, with the czar as Grand Duke. Russia assigned [[Old Finland|Karelia]] (&quot;Old Finland&quot;) to the Grand Duchy in 1812. During the years of Russian rule the degree of autonomy varied. Periods of censorship and political prosecution occurred, particularly in the two last decades of Russian control, but the Finnish peasantry remained free (unlike the Russian serfs) as the old Swedish law remained effective (including the relevant parts from [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]'s [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|Constitution of 1772]]). The old [[Riksdag of the Estates|four-chamber Diet]] was re-activated in the 1860s agreeing to supplementary new legislation concerning internal affairs.

===Economy===
Before 1860 overseas merchant firms and the owners of landed estates had accumulated wealth that became available for industrial investments. After 1860 the government liberalized economic laws and began to build a suitable physical infrastructure of ports, railroads and telegraph lines. The domestic market was small but rapid growth took place after 1860 in export industries drawing on forest resources and mobile rural laborers.  Industrialization began during the mid-19th century from forestry to industry, mining and machinery and laid the foundation of Finland's current day prosperity, even though agriculture employed a relatively large part of the population until the post–World War II era.

The beginnings of industrialism took place in Helsinki. Alfred Kihlman (1825-1904) began as a Lutheran priest and director of the elite Helsingfors boys' school, the Swedish Normal Lyceum. He became a financier and member of the diet. There was little precedent in Finland in the 1850s for raising venture capital. Kihlman was well connected and enlisted businessmen and capitalists to invest in new enterprises. In 1869, he organized a limited partnership that supported two years of developmental activities that led to the founding of the [[Nokia]] company in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Martti Häikiö, ''Nokia: the inside story'' (2002) p 35&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1890 industrial productivity stagnated because entrepreneurs were unable to keep up with technological innovations made by competitors in Germany, Britain and the United States. However, Russification opened up a large Russian market especially for machinery.

===Nationalism===
{{Main|Finland's language strife}}
Particularly following Finland's incorporation into the Swedish central administration during the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] was spoken by about 15% of the population, especially the upper and middle classes. Swedish was the language of administration, public institutions, education and cultural life. Only the peasants spoke Finnish. The emergence of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] to predominance resulted from a 19th-century surge of Finnish nationalism, aided by Russian bureaucrats attempting to separate Finns from Sweden and to ensure the Finns' loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Coleman, &quot;'You Might All Be Speaking Swedish Today': language change in 19th-century Finland and Ireland,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' March 2010, Vol. 35 Issue 1, pp 44-64,&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication in 1835 of the Finnish [[national epic]], the [[Kalevala]], a collection of traditional myths and legends which is the [[folklore]] of the [[Karelian people]] (the [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] people who inhabit the [[Lake Ladoga]]-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), stirred the [[nationalism]] that later led to Finland's independence from Russia. The Finnish national awakening in the mid-19th century was the result of members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of [[nation building]], i.e. to establish a feeling of unity between all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling elite and the ruled peasantry.

In 1863, the Finnish language gained an official position in administration. In 1892 Finnish finally became an equal official language and gained a status comparable to that of Swedish. Nevertheless, the Swedish language continued to be the language of culture, arts and business all the way to 1920s. 

Movements toward Finnish national pride, as well as liberalism in politics and economics involved ethnic and class dimensions. The nationalist movement against Russia began with the &quot;Fennomanian movement&quot; led by Hegelian philosopher [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]] in the 1830s. Snellman sought to apply philosophy to social action and moved the basis of Finnish nationalism to establishment of the language in the schools, while remaining loyal to the czar. Fennomania became the Finnish Party in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Lavery, ''The history of Finland'' (2006) p. 58-60&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Paavo Ruotsalainen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Paavo Ruotsalainen, a layman, led pietistic revivals]]

Liberalism was the central issue of the 1860s to 1880s. The language issue overlapped both liberalism and nationalism, and showed some a class conflict as well, with the peasants pitted against the conservative Swedish-speaking landowners and nobles. As complications, the Finnish activists divided into &quot;old&quot; (no compromise on the language question and conservative nationalism) and &quot;young&quot; (liberation from Russia) Finns. The leading liberals were Swedish-speaking intellectuals who called for more democracy; they became the radical leaders after 1880.  The liberals organized for social democracy, labor unions, farmer cooperatives, and women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Mikko Juva, &quot;Nationalism, Liberalism Och Demokrati Under Språkstridens Första Skede i Finlan&quot; ['Nationalism, liberalism and democracy during the first period of the language conflict in Finland'] ''Historisk Tidskrift,'' 1961, Issue 4, pp 357-368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The Finns were Lutherans but there were two strains that eventually merged to form the modern Finnish church.  On the one hand  was the high-church emphasis on ritual, with its roots in traditional peasant collective society. [[Paavo Ruotsalainen]] (1777-1852) on the other hand was a leader of the new pietism, with its subjectivity, revivalism, emphasis on personal morality, lay participation, and the [[social gospel]].  The pietism appealed to the emerging middle class. The Ecclesiastical Law of 1869 combined the two strains.  Finland's political and Lutheran leaders considered both Russian Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism to be threats to the emerging nation. Orthodoxy was rejected as a weapon of Russification, while anti-Catholicism was long-standing. Anti-Semitism was also a factor, so the Dissenter Law of 1889 upgraded the status only of the minor Protestant sects.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Gassmann et al. ''Historical dictionary of Lutheranism'' (2001) p 296&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Before 1790 music was found in Lutheran churches and in folk traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth-Esther Hillila, and Barbara Blanchard, ''Historical Dictionary of the Music and Musicians of Finland'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1790 music lovers founded the Åbo Musical Society; it gave the first major stimulus to serious music by Finnish composers.  In the 1880s, new institutions, especially the Helsinki Music Institute (since 1939 called the [[Sibelius Academy]]), the  Institute of Music of Helsinki University and the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], integrated Finland into the mainstream of European music. By far the most influential composer was [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865-1957); he composed most of his music before 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Denby Richards, &quot;Music in Finland,&quot; ''American-Scandinavian Review,'' 1968, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1892 Sibelius presented his new symphony 'Kullervo' in Helsinki. It featured poetry from the ''Kalevala,'' and was celebrated by critics as truly Finnish music.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Dawn Goss, &quot;A Backdrop for Young Sibelius: The Intellectual Genesis of the Kullervo Symphony,&quot; ''19th Century Music,'' Summer 2003, Vol. 27 Issue 1, pp 48-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
Upper and upper middle class women took the lead in the deaconess movement in Finland. Coordinated by the Lutheran church, the women undertook local charitable social work to ameliorate harsh living conditions created by peasants adjusting to city life. They promoted nursing as a suitable profession for respectable women.  Their efforts helped redefine the complex relationship between private charities and the traditional state and church responsibility for social welfare. Because they volunteered without pay and emphasized motherhood and nurturing as moral values for women, they contributed to the entrenchment of what in the 20th century became widespread gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Pirjo Markkola, &quot;Promoting Faith and Welfare: The Deaconess Movement in Finland and Sweden, 1850–1930,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' Mar-June 2000, Vol. 25 Issue 1/2, pp 101-118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russification===
{{Main|Russification of Finland}}

The policy of Russification of Finland (1899–1905 and 1908–1917, called ''sortokaudet/sortovuodet'' (times/years of oppression) in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) was the policy of the Russian czars designed to limit the special status of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and more fully integrate it politically, militarily, and culturally into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Thaden, ''Russification in the Baltic Provinces and Finland'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Finns were strongly opposed and fought back by passive resistance and a strengthening of Finnish cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Huxley, ''Constitutionalist insurgency in Finland: Finnish &quot;passive resistance&quot; against Russification as a case of nonmilitary struggle in the European resistance tradition'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  Key provisions were the &quot;February Manifesto of 1899&quot; which asserted the imperial government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies. Second, the &quot;Language Manifesto of 1900&quot; which made Russian the language of administration of Finland. Third, the conscription law of 1901 incorporated the [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish army]] into the imperial army and sent conscripts away to Russian training camps.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomo Polvinen, ''Imperial Borderland: Bobrikov and the Attempted Russification of Finland, 1898–1904'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic change ====
In 1906, as a result of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the associated [[Finnish general strike of 1905]], the old [[Diet of Finland|four-chamber Diet]] was replaced by a unicameral [[Parliament of Finland]] ''(the &quot;{{lang|fi|Eduskunta}}&quot;).'' For the first time in Europe, [[universal suffrage]] (right to vote) and eligibility was implemented to include women: Finnish women were the first in Europe to gain full eligibility to vote; and have membership in an estate; land ownership or inherited titles were no longer required.
However, on the local level things were different, as in the municipal elections the number of votes was tied to amount of tax paid. Thus, rich people could cast a number of votes, while the poor perhaps none at all. The municipal voting system was changed to universal suffrage in 1917
when a left-wing majority was elected to Parliament.

===Emigration trends===
{{main|Finnish American|Canadians of Finnish ancestry}}
Emigration was especially important 1890-1914,&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics, 1750-1970'' (Columbia U.P., 1978) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; with many young men and some families headed to [[Finnish American|Finnish settlements in the United States]], and also [[Canadians of Finnish ancestry|to Canada]].  They typically worked in lumbering and mining, and many were active in Marxist causes on the one hand, or the [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] on the other.  In the 21st century about 700,000 Americans and 110,000 Canadians claim Finnish ancestry.

==Independence and Civil War==
{{Main|Finland's declaration of independence|Finnish Civil War}}

In the aftermath of the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, Finland received a new [[Senate of Finland|Senate]], a coalition-Cabinet with the same power structure as the Finnish Parliament. Based on the [[general election]] in 1916, the [[Social democracy|Social Democrat]]s had a small majority, and the Social Democrat [[Oskari Tokoi]] became prime minister. The new Senate was willing to cooperate with the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|provisional government]] of Russia, but no agreement was reached. Finland considered the [[personal union]] with Russia to be over after the dethroning of the [[Tsar]] – although the Finns had ''de facto'' recognized the provisional government as the Tsar's successor by accepting its authority to appoint a new Governor General and Senate. They expected the Tsar's authority to be transferred to Finland's Parliament, which the provisional government of Russia refused, suggesting instead that the question should be settled by the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. 

For the Finnish Social Democrats it seemed as though the bourgeoisie was an obstacle on Finland's road to independence as well as on the proletariat's road to power. The non-Socialists in Tokoi's Senate were, however, more confident. They and most of the non-Socialists in the Parliament, rejected the Social Democrats' proposal on parliamentarism (the so-called &quot;Power Act&quot;) as being too far-reaching and provocative. The act restricted Russia's influence on domestic Finnish matters, but didn't touch the Russian government's power on matters of defence and foreign affairs. For the Russian Provisional government this was, however, far too radical. As the Parliament had exceeded its authority, it was dissolved.

The minority of the Parliament, and of the Senate, were content. New elections promised a chance to gain majority, which they were convinced would improve the chances to reach an understanding with Russia. The non-Socialists were also inclined to cooperate with the Russian Provisional government because they feared the Socialists' power would grow, resulting in radical reforms, such as [[Suffrage|equal suffrage]] in municipal elections, or a [[land reform]]. The majority had the completely opposite opinion. They didn't accept the Provisional government's right to dissolve the Parliament.

The Social Democrats held on to the Power Act and opposed the [[promulgation]] of the decree of dissolution of the Parliament, whereas the non-Socialists voted for promulgating it. The disagreement over the Power Act led to the Social Democrats leaving the Senate. When the Parliament met again after the summer recess in August 1917, only the groups supporting the Power Act were present.  Russian troops took possession of the chamber, the Parliament was dissolved, and new elections were carried out. The result was a (small) non-Socialist majority and a purely non-Socialist Senate. The suppression of the Power Act, and the cooperation between Finnish non-Socialist forces and oppressive Russia provoked great bitterness among the Socialists, and had resulted in dozens of politically motivated attacks and murders.

===Independence===
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917 turned Finnish politics upside down. Now, the new non-Socialist majority of the Parliament desired total independence, and the Socialists came gradually to view Soviet Russia as an example to follow. On November 15, 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, [[Declaration of Rights of Peoples of Russia|&quot;for the Peoples of Russia&quot;]]. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland.

Worried by the development in Russia, and Finland, the non-Socialist Senate proposed that Parliament [[Finland's declaration of independence|declare Finland's independence]], which was agreed on in the Parliament on December 6, 1917. On December 18 (December 31 [[New Style|N. S.]]) the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] issued a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]], recognizing Finland's independence, and on December 22 (January 4, 1918 N. S.) it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body – [[VTsIK]]. Germany and the Scandinavian countries followed without delay.

===Civil War===
{{main|Finnish Civil War}}
Finland after 1917 was bitterly divided along social lines. The Whites consisted of the Swedish-speaking middle and upper classes and the farmers and peasantry who dominated the northern two-thirds of the land. They had a conservative outlook and rejected socialism. The socialist-Communist Reds comprised the Finnish-speaking urban workers and the landless rural cottagers.  They had a radical outlook and rejected capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Kalevi Hamalainen, ''In Time of Storm: Revolution, Civil War and the Ethnolinguistic Issue in Finland'' (HIA Book Collection, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

From January to May 1918, Finland experienced the brief but bitter [[Finnish Civil War]]. On one side there were the &quot;white&quot; civil guards, who fought for the anti-Socialists. On the other side were the Red Guards, which consisted of workers and tenant farmers. The latter proclaimed a [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. World War I was still underway and the defeat of the Red Guards was achieved with support from [[Imperial Germany]], while Sweden remained neutral and Russia withdrew its forces. The Reds lost the war and the White peasantry rose to political leadership in the 1920s-1930s. About 37,000 men died, most of them in prisoner camps ravaged by influenza and other diseases.

==Finland in the inter-war era==
After the civil war the parliament, controlled by the Whites, voted to establish a constitutional monarchy to be called the ''[[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Finland]]'', with a [[Frederick Charles of Hesse|German prince as king]]. However, Germany's defeat in November  1918 made the plan impossible and Finland instead became a republic, with [[Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg]] elected as its first President in 1919.  Despite the bitter civil war, and repeated threats from fascist movements, Finland became and remained a capitalist democracy under the rule of law. By contrast, nearby [[History of Estonia|Estonia]], in similar circumstances but without a civil war, started as a democracy and was turned into a dictatorship in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Siaroff, &quot;Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland,&quot; ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' Vol. 32,No. 1 (March , 1999), pp. 103-124 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian reform===
Large scale agrarian reform in the 1920s involved breaking up the large estates controlled by the old nobility and selling the land to ambitious peasants. The farmers became strong supporters of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jörgensen, &quot;The Inter-War Land Reforms in Estonia, Finland  and Bulgaria: A Comparative Study,&quot; ''Scandinavian Economic History Review,'' April 2006, Vol. 54 Issue 1, pp 64-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
The new republic faced a dispute over the [[Åland]] Islands, which were overwhelmingly Swedish-speaking and sought retrocession to Sweden. However, as Finland was not willing to cede the islands, they were offered an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the [[League of Nations]]. The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the Åland Islands, but they should be made an autonomous province. Thus Finland was under an obligation to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands a right to maintain the [[Swedish language]], as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty was concluded on the neutral status of Åland, under which it was prohibited to place military headquarters or forces on the islands.

===Prohibition===
Alcohol abuse had a long history, especially regarding binge drinking and public intoxication, which became a crime in 1733. In the 19th century the punishments became stiffer and stiffer, but the problem persisted. A strong abstinence movement emerged that cut consumption in half from the 1880s to the 1910s, and gave Finland the lowest drinking rate in Europe. Four attempts at instituting [[Prohibition in Finland|prohibition of alcohol]] during the Grand Duchy period were rejected by the czar; with the czar gone Finland enacted prohibition in 1919. Smuggling emerged and enforcement was slipshod. Criminal convictions for drunkenness went up by 500%, and violence and crime rates soared. Public opinion turned against the law, and a national plebiscite went 70% for repeal, so prohibition was ended in early 1932.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Wuorinen, &quot;Finland's Prohibition Experiment,&quot; ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' vol. 163, (September , 1932), pp. 216-226 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1017701 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Sariola,  &quot;Prohibition in Finland, 1919-1932; its background and consequences,&quot; ''Quarterly Journal of Studies in Alcohol'' (September 1954) 15(3) pp 477-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Nationalist sentiment remaining from the Civil War developed into the proto-Fascist [[Lapua Movement]] in 1929. Initially the movement gained widespread support among anti-Communist Finns, but following [[Mäntsälä Rebellion|a failed coup attempt]] in 1932 it was banned and its leaders imprisoned.

===Relations with Soviet Union===
In the wake of the Civil War there were many incidents along the border between Finland and Soviet Russia, such as the [[Aunus expedition]] and the [[Pork mutiny]]. Relations with the Soviets were improved after the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, in which Finland gained [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], but gave up its claims on [[East Karelia]].

Tens of thousands of radical Finns—from Finland, the United States and Canada—took up Stalin's 1923 appeal to create a new Soviet society in the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]  (KASSR), a part of Russia. 
Most were executed in the purges of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas and Nicholas C.J. Pappas, ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'' (1994) p 350&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union started to tighten its policy against Finland in the 1930s, limiting the navigation of Finnish merchant ships between [[Lake Ladoga]] and the [[Gulf of Finland]] and blocking it totally in 1937.

==Finland in World War II==
{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}

[[Image:Suurin Suomi.PNG|thumb|The area controlled by Finland at its largest, in 1942.]]

During World War II, Finland fought two wars against the Soviet Union: the [[Winter War]] of 1939–1940, resulting in the loss of [[Finnish Karelia]], and the [[Continuation War]] of 1941–1944 (with considerable support from [[Nazi Germany]] resulting in a swift invasion of [[East Karelia|neighboring areas]] of the Soviet Union), eventually leading to the loss of Finland's only ice-free winter harbour [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. The Continuation War was, in accordance with the [[Moscow armistice|armistice conditions]], immediately followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944–1945, when Finland fought the Germans to force them to withdraw from northern Finland back into Norway (then under German occupation).&lt;ref&gt;Henrik O. Lunde, ''Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Alliance in World War II'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1939 Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], where Finland and the Baltic states were given to the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. After the [[Invasion of Poland]], the Soviet Union sent ultimatums to the Baltic countries, where it demanded military bases on their soil. The Baltic states accepted Soviet demands, and lost their independence in the summer of 1940. In October 1939, the Soviet Union sent the same kind of request to Finland, but the Finns refused to give any land areas or military bases for the usage of the Red Army. This caused the Soviet Union to start a [[Winter War|military invasion against Finland]] on 30 November 1939. Soviet leaders predicted that Finland would be conquered in a couple of weeks. However, even though the Red Army had huge superiority in men, tanks, guns and airplanes, the Finns were able to defend their country about 3.5 months and still avoid invasion successfully. The Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with the [[Moscow peace treaty]]. Finland lost the [[Karelian Isthmus]] to the Soviet Union after the war. The Winter War was a big loss of prestige for Soviet Union, and it was expelled from the League of Nations because of the illegal attack. Finland received lots of international goodwill and material help from many countries during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Eloise Engle, ''The Winter War: The Soviet Attack on Finland 1939-1940'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Winter War the Finnish army was exhausted, and needed recovery and support as soon as possible. The British declined to help but in autumn 1940 Nazi Germany offered weapon deals to Finland, if the Finnish government would allow German troops to travel through Finland to occupied Norway. Finland accepted, weapon deals were made and military co-operation began in December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde, ''Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Alliance in World War II'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's support from, and coordination with, Nazi Germany starting during the winter of 1940–41 and made other countries considerably less sympathetic to the Finnish cause; particularly since the [[Continuation War]] led to a Finnish invasion of the Soviet Union designed not only to recover lost territory, but additionally to answer the irredentist sentiment of a [[Greater Finland]] by [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941–1944|incorporating East Karelia]], whose inhabitants were culturally related to the Finnish people, although religiously [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]. This invasion had caused the United Kingdom to declare war on Finland on 6 December 1941.

Finland managed to defend its democracy, contrary to most other countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, and suffered comparably limited losses in terms of civilian lives and property. It was, however, punished harsher than other German [[co-belligerence|co-belligerents]] and allies, having to pay large [[war reparations|reparations]] and resettle an eighth of its population after having lost an eighth of the territory including one of its industrial heartlands and the second-largest city of [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. After the war, the Soviet government settled these gained territories with people from many different regions of the USSR, for instance from [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The Finnish government did not participate in the systematic killing of Jews, although the country remained a &quot;co-belligrent&quot;, a ''[[de facto]]'' ally of Germany until 1944. In total, eight German Jewish refugees were handed over to the German authorities. 

During and in between the wars, approximately 80,000 [[Finnish war-children]] were evacuated abroad: 5% went to Norway, 10% to Denmark, and the rest to Sweden. Most of the children were sent back by 1948, but 15–20% remained abroad.

The [[Moscow Armistice]] was signed between [[Finland]] on one side and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[United Kingdom]] on the other side on September 19, 1944, ending the [[Continuation War]]. The armistice compelled Finland to drive German troops from its territory, leading to the [[Lapland War]] 1944-1945.

In 1947, Finland reluctantly declined [[Marshall aid]] in order to preserve good relations with the Soviets, ensuring Finnish autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jakobson&quot;&gt;Jakobson, Max. Finland in the New Europe. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2009. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the United States shipped secret development aid and financial aid to the non-communist SDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Hidden+help+from+across+the+Atlantic/1135223633788 Hidden help from across the Atlantic], Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the reparations to the Soviet Union caused Finland to transform itself from a primarily [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy to an [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] one. After the reparations had been paid off, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of [[Bilateralism|bilateral trade]].

Finland's role in the Second World War was in many ways strange. Firstly the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in 1939–1940. However, even with massive superiority in military strength, the Soviet Union was unable to conquer Finland. In late 1940, German-Finnish co-operation began; it took a form that was unique when compared to relations with the [[The Axis|Axis]]. Finland signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which made Finland an ally with Germany in the war against the Soviet Union. But, unlike all other Axis states, Finland never signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and so Finland never was ''[[de jure]]'' an Axis nation.

In the [[Tehran Conference]] of 1942, the leaders of the [[Allies]] agreed that Finland was fighting a separate war against the Soviet Union, and that in no way was it hostile to the Western allies. The Soviet Union was the only Allied country which Finland had conducted military operations against. Unlike any of the Axis nations, Finland was a parliamentary democracy throughout the 1939–1945 period. The commander of Finnish armed forces during the Winter War and the Continuation War, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], became the [[President of Finland]] after the war. Finland made a separate peace contract with the Soviet Union on 19 September 1944, and was the only bordering country of USSR in Europe that kept its independence after the war.

==Postwar==

===Neutrality in Cold War===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finlandization]] --&gt;
Finland retained a democratic constitution and free economy during the [[Cold War]] era. Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations and restraints on Finland, as well as territorial concessions. Both treaties have been abrogated by Finland since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, while leaving the borders untouched. Even though being a neighbour to the mighty Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overly cautious concern in foreign policy (&quot;[[Finlandization]]&quot;), Finland developed closer co-operation with the other [[Nordic countries]] and declared itself [[Neutral country|neutral]] in superpower politics.

In 1952, Finland and the countries of the [[Nordic Council]] entered into a passport union, allowing their citizens to cross borders without passports and soon also to apply for jobs and claim social security benefits in the other countries. Many from Finland used this opportunity to secure better paying jobs in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s, dominating Sweden's first wave of post-war labour immigrants. Although Finnish wages and standard of living could not compete with wealthy Sweden until the 1970s, the Finnish economy rose remarkably from the ashes of World War II, resulting in the buildup of another Nordic-style welfare state.

Despite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland Finland could not join the [[Nordic Council]] until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too close to the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the [[Nordic Council]] as part of [[NATO]] of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members. 
That same year Finland joined the [[United Nations]], though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations. The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956–1959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959–1965), [[Max Jakobson]] (1965–1972), Aarno Karhilo (1972–1977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977–1983), [[Keijo Korhonen]] (1983–1988), Klaus Törnudd (1988–1991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991–1998) and Marjatta Rasi (1998–2005). In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for [[Secretary-General]] of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the [[Porkkala]] peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality.

Finland became an associate member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] in 1961 and a full member in 1986. A trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] was complemented by another with the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]. The first Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which lead to the creation of the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], was held in Finland in 1972–1973. The CSCE was widely considered in Finland as a possible means of reducing tensions of the Cold War, and a personal triumph for President [[Urho Kekkonen]].

Officially claiming to be [[Neutral country|neutral]], Finland lay in the grey zone between the [[Western world|Western countries]] and the Soviet Union. The &quot;[[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]]&quot; (Finno-Soviet Pact of ''Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance'') gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. However, Finland maintained [[capitalism]] unlike most other countries bordering the Soviet Union. Property rights were strong. While nationalization committees were set up in France and UK, Finland avoided nationalizations. After failed experiments with protectionism in the 1950s, Finland eased restrictions and made a free trade agreement with the [[European Community]] in 1973, making its markets more competitive. Local education markets expanded and an increasing number of Finns also went abroad to study in the United States or Western Europe, bringing back advanced skills. There was a quite common, but pragmatic-minded, credit and investment cooperation by state and corporations, though it was considered with suspicion. Support for capitalism was widespread.&lt;ref name=&quot;equity&quot;&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRANETSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/finland.pdf Growth and Equity in Finland], World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; Savings rate hovered among the world's highest, at around 8% until the 1980s. In the beginning of the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita reached the level of Japan and the UK. Finland's economic development shared many aspects with export-led Asian countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;equity&quot;/&gt;

===Society and the welfare state===
Before 1940 Finland was a poor rural nation of urban and rural workers and independent farmers. There was a small middle class, employed chiefly as civil servants and in small local businesses. As late as 1950 half of the workers were in agriculture and only a third lived in urban towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;populationdevelopment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Finland 1917-2007 |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suomi90/joulukuu_en.html |title=Population development in independent Finland – greying Baby Boomers |publisher=Stat.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the towns and cities. The average number of births per woman declined from [[baby boom]] a peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;populationdevelopment&quot;/&gt; When baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy did not generate jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the more industrialized Sweden, migration peaking in 1969 and 1970 (today 4.7 percent of Swedes speak Finnish).&lt;ref name=&quot;populationdevelopment&quot;/&gt; The [[1952 Summer Olympics]] brought international visitors and marked the nation's most visible presence on the international stage.

By the 1990s, farm laborers had nearly all moved on, leaving owners of small farms. By 2000 the social structure included a politically active working class, a primarily clerical middle class, and an upper bracket consisting of managers, entrepreneurs, and professionals. The social boundaries between these groups were not distinct. Causes of change included the growth of a mass culture, international standards, social mobility, and acceptance of democracy and equality as typified by the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Pertti Haapala, and Brian Fleming, &quot;The Fate of the Welfare State,&quot; ''Historiallinen Aikakauskirja,' 1998, Vol. 96 Issue 2, pp 142-149&lt;/ref&gt;

The generous system of welfare benefits emerged from a long process of debate, negotiations and maneuvers between efficiency-oriented modernizers on the one hand and Social Democrats and labor unions. A compulsory system provides old-age and disability insurance, financed mostly by taxes on employers. The national government provides unemployment insurance, maternity benefits, family allowances, and day-care centers. Health insurance covers most of the cost of outpatient care. The national health act of 1972 provided for the establishment of free health centers in every municipality.&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Kettunen, &quot;The Nordic Welfare State in Finland,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' September 2001, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 225-247&lt;/ref&gt;  There were major cutbacks in the early 1990s, but they were distributed to minimize the harm to the vast majority of voters.&lt;ref&gt;Mikko Mattila, and Petri Uusikyla, &quot;The politics of scarcity: Social welfare  and health care cutbacks in Finland, 1991-1995,&quot; ''West European Politics,'' October 1997, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp 146-63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
The post-war period was a time of rapid economic growth and increasing social and political stability for Finland. The five decades after the Second World War saw Finland turn from a war-ravaged agrarian society into one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, with a sophisticated market economy and high standard of living.

In 1991 [[Early 1990s recession in Finland|Finland fell into a depression]] caused by a combination of [[Overheating (economics)|economic overheating]], fixed currency, depressed Western, Soviet, and local markets. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/evds/yayin/kitaplar/enf_kitap/4-Antti_Suvanto.pdf |title=Inflation targeting: Reflection from the Finnish experience |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in. GDP declined by 15% and [[unemployment]] increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to cut spending and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;/&gt; Some 7–8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/temp/TUNNISTE_VaVM_15_1996_fi.html |title=Converted |publisher=217.71.145.20 |date=1996-05-14 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After devaluations the depression bottomed out in 1993.

==Recent history==
The GDP growth rate has since been one of the highest of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries and Finland has topped many indicators of national performance.

Until 1991, President [[Mauno Koivisto]] and two of the three major parties, Center Party and the Social Democrats opposed the idea of European Union membership and preferred entering into the [[European Economic Area]] treaty. However, after Sweden had submitted its membership application in 1991 and the Soviet Union was dissolved at the end of the year, Finland submitted its own application to the [[European Union|EC]] in March 1992. The accession process was marked by heavy public debate, where the differences of opinion did not follow party lines. Officially, all three major parties were supporting the Union membership, but members of all parties participated in the campaign against the membership.  Before the parliamentary decision to join the EU, a [[referendum|consultative referendum]] was held on April 16, 1994 in which 56.9% of the votes were in favour of joining. The process of accession was completed on January 1, 1995, when Finland joined the [[European Union]] along with Austria and Sweden. Leading Finland into the EU is held as the main achievement of the [[Keskusta|Centrist]]-[[Kokoomus|Conservative]] government of [[Esko Aho]] then in power.

In the economic policy, the EU membership forced large changes. While politicians were previously involved in setting interest rates, the central bank was given an inflation-targeting mandate until Finland joined the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;/&gt; During Prime Minister [[Paavo Lipponen]]'s two successive governments 1995–2003, several large state companies were privatized fully or partially. Matti Vanhanen's two cabinets followed suit until autumn 2008, when the state became a major shareholder in the Finnish telecom company Elisa with the intention to secure the Finnish ownership of a strategically important industry.

In addition to fast integration with the European Union, safety against Russian leverage has been increased by building fully [[NATO]]-compatible military. 1000 troops (a high per-capita amount) are simultaneously committed in NATO and UN operations. Finland has also opposed energy projects that increase dependency on Russian imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/?contentid=89857&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=Nato: Address by Mr Pertti Torstila, Secretary of State, to the Macedonian Diplomatic Bulletin |publisher=Formin.finland.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Finland remains one of the last non-NATO members in Europe and there seems to be not enough support for full membership unless Sweden joins first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/julkaisut/finland_and_nato/chapter_9.dsp Finland and NATO], Tomas Ries.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population is aging with the [[List of countries by birth rate|birth rate]] at 10.42 births/1,000 population or fertility rate at 1.8.&lt;ref name=&quot;populationdevelopment&quot;/&gt; With median age at 41.6 years Finland is one of the oldest countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/topic.jsp?i=81 |title=Median Age (Years) – |publisher=Globalhealthfacts.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}
