One of the [[fossil]]s found—a male, adult [[Human jawbone|jawbone]]—has been dated to be between 34,000 and 36,000 years old, which would make it one of the oldest fossils found to date of modern humans in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;amos&quot;&gt;Jonathan Amos, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3129654.stm &quot;Human fossils set European record&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', 22 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A skull found in ''[[Peștera cu Oase]]'' (The Cave with Bones) in 2004-5 bears features of both modern humans and [[Neanderthal]]s. According to a paper by [[Erik Trinkaus]] and others, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] in January 2007, this finding suggests that the two groups interbred thousands of years ago.

[[File:Sarmisegetusa Regia - ansamblu 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[sanctuaries]] of the ancient [[Dacian Kingdom]] capital, [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]]]]
The earliest written evidence of people living in the territory of the present-day Romania comes from [[Herodotus]] in book IV of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' written c. 440 BCE. Herein he writes that the tribal confederation of the [[Getae]] were defeated by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Emperor [[Darius the Great]] during his campaign against the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Herodotus|author-link =Herodotus|title =The Ancient History of Herodotus By Herodotus|digitized =Google Book Search|pages =213–217|publisher = Derby &amp; Jackson|year =1859|url =http://books.google.com/?id=sfHsgNIZum0C&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=herodotus+dacians+darius|accessdate=2008-01-10|trans_title = William Beloe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dacians]], widely accepted as part of the [[Getae]] described earlier by the Greeks, were a branch of [[Thracians]] that inhabited [[Dacia]] (corresponding to modern Romania, [[Moldova]], northern [[Bulgaria]] and surroundings). The [[Dacian Kingdom]] reached its maximum expansion during King [[Burebista]], between 82 BCE - 44 BCE. Under his leadership Dacia became a powerful state which threatened the regional interests of the Romans. [[Julius Caesar]] intended to start a campaign against the Dacians, due to the support that Burebista gave to [[Pompey]], but was assassinated in [[44 BC]]. A few months later, Burebista shared the same fate, assassinated by his own noblemen. Another theory suggests that he was killed by Caesar's friends. His powerful state was divided in four and did not become unified again until 95 AD, under the reign of the Dacian king [[Decebalus]].

The [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Moesia]] by 29 BC, reaching the Danube. In 87 AD Emperor [[Domitian]] sent six legions into Dacia, which were [[Domitian's Dacian War|defeated at Tapae]]. The Dacians were eventually defeated by Emperor [[Trajan]] in [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|two campaigns]] stretching from 101&amp;nbsp;AD to 106&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =Assorted Imperial Battle Descriptions|publisher =De Imperatoribus Romanis, An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|url =http://www.roman-emperors.org/assobd.htm#s-inx|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the core of their kingdom was turned into the province of [[Roman Dacia]].

[[File:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|right|thumb|350px|[[Roman Dacia]], between 106 and 271 AD]]
The Romans exploited the rich ore deposits of Dacia. Gold and silver were especially plentiful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dacia-Province of the Roman Empire|publisher =United Nations of Roma Victor|url =http://www.unrv.com/provinces/dacia.php|quote=&quot;and were found in great quantities in the [[Western Carpathians]].

After Trajan's conquest, he brought back to Rome over 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver. The Romans heavily colonized the province,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deletant|first=Dennis|title=Colloquial Romanian|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|location=New York|pages =1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus started a period of intense [[romanization]], the [[Vulgar Latin]] giving birth to the [[Proto-Romanian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matley|first=Ian|title=Romania; a Profile|publisher=Praeger|year=1970|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giurescu|first=Constantin C.|title=The Making of the Romanian People and Language|publisher=Meridiane Publishing House|year=1972|location=Bucharest|pages=43, 98–101, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical position of ''Dacia Felix'' (another name for the [[Roman province of Dacia]]) made it difficult to defend against the barbarians, and during 240 AD - 256 AD, under the attacks of the [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]] and the [[Goths]], Dacia was lost. The [[Roman Empire]] withdrew from ''Dacia Romana'' around 271 AD, thus making it the first province to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Eutropius|authorlink=Eutropius (historian)|coauthors=Justin, Cornelius Nepos|title=Eutropius, Abridgment of Roman History|publisher=George Bell and Sons|year=1886|location=London|url=http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/eutropius_breviarium_2_text.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Thayer|title=The Economic History of the Western Roman Empire|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/barbarians.htm|quote=&quot;The Emperor Aurelian recognized the realities of the military situation in Dacia and around 271 A.D. withdrew Roman troops from Dacia leaving it to the Goths. The Danube once again became the northern frontier of the Roman Empire in eastern Europe&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman conquest of Dacia stands at the base of the [[origin of Romanians]]. Several competing theories have been introduced to explain the origin of modern Romanians. Linguistic and geo-historical analyses tend to indicate that [[Romanians]] have coalesced as a major ethnic group both South and North of the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghyka|first=Matila|title=A Documented Chronology of Roumanian History|location=Oxford|publisher =B.

Different migrating peoples lived along the local populations, such as the [[Goths|Gothic]] Empire ([[Oium]]) from 271 until 378, the [[Huns|Hunnish Empire]] until 435, the [[Eurasian Avars|Avar Empire]] and [[Slavs]] during the 6th century. Subsequently [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Tatars]] also raided and settled in the lands to various extents.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Romania in the Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Wallachia in the Middle Ages}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], Romanians lived in three distinct principalities: [[Wallachia]] ({{lang-ro|Ţara Românească}}—&quot;Romanian Land&quot;), [[Moldavia]] ({{lang-ro|Moldova}}) and [[Transylvania]].

The [[Pechenegs]] (a semi-nomadic [[Turkic people]] of the Central Asian steppes) occupied the steppes north of the [[Black Sea]] (8th–12th century) and by the 10th century were in control of the lands between the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Danube]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448299/Pechenegs&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 11th and 12th century, the nomadic confederacy of the [[Cumans]] and (Eastern) Kipchaks (who are considered to be either the eastern branch of the Cumans or a distinct but related tribe with whom the Cumans created a confederacy) were the dominant force over the vast territories stretching from the present-day Kazakhstan, southern Russia, Ukraine, to southern Moldavia and western Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511110153&amp;ss=fro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eliznik.org.uk/RomaniaHistory/wallachia-history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474977384642&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=8C6P3PYaPmQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=%22cuman%22+wallachia&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 11th century, the area of today's Transylvania became a largely autonomous part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. [[Hungarian rulers|Kings of Hungary]] invited the [[Saxons]] to settle in Transylvania. Also living in Transylvania were the [[Székely]]. After the Magyar conquest (10-11th century), Transylvania became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=László|last=Makkai|editor-last = Köpeczi|editor-first = Béla

Independent [[Wallachia]] has been on the border of the [[Ottoman Empire]] since the 14th century and slowly fell under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century. One famous ruler in this period was [[Vlad III the Impaler]] (also known as [[Vlad Dracula]] or {{lang-ro|Vlad Ţepeş}}), [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of [[Wallachia]] in 1448, 1456–62, and 1476.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Schoolfield|first =George C.|title =A Baedeker of Decadence: Charting a Literary Fashion, 1884-1927

As king, he maintained an independent policy in relation to the [[Ottoman Empire]], and in Romania he is viewed by many as a prince with a deep sense of justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title =Count Dracul's Legend| year =2006| url =http://www.romaniatourism.com/dracula.html| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a defender of both Wallachia and European [[Christianity]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[expansionism]].

The principality of [[Moldavia]] reached its most glorious period under the rule of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] between 1457 and 1504.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Marek|first =Miroslav|title =Rulers of Moldavia: Mushati family|url =http://genealogy.euweb.cz/balkan/balkan18.html}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rule of 47 years was unusually long, especially at that time - only [[List of longest reigning monarchs of all time|13 rulers]] worldwide were recorded to have ruled for at least 50 years until the end of 15th century. He was a very successful military leader (winning 47 battles and losing only 2&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =St. Stephen the Great Charitable Trust|url =http://www.ststephentrust.org.uk/html/ststephen.html}} {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and after each victory, he raised a church, managing to build 48 churches or monasteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Orthodox Church in America|title = St. Stephen the Great - Commemorated on July 2|url =http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=149011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of them with unique and very interesting painting styles. ''For more information see [[Painted churches of northern Moldavia]] listed in [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Sites]]''. Stephen's most prestigious victory was over the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1475 at the [[Battle of Vaslui]] for which he raised the [[Voroneţ Monastery]]. For this victory, [[Pope]] [[Sixtus IV]] deemed him ''verus christianae fidei athleta'' (''true Champion of Christian Faith''). However, after his death, [[Moldavia]] would also come under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century.

By 1541, the entire [[Balkan peninsula]] and most of [[Hungary]] became Ottoman provinces. In contrast, Moldavia, Wallachia, and [[Transylvania]], came under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], but conserved fully internal autonomy and, until the 18th century, some external independence. During this period the Romanian lands were characterised by the slow disappearance of the [[feudalism|feudal]] system, the distinguishment of some rulers like [[Vasile Lupu]] and [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] in Moldavia, [[Matei Basarab]] and [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] in Wallachia, [[Gabriel Bethlen]] in [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Transylvania]], the [[Phanariot|Phanariot Epoch]], and the appearance of the [[Russian Empire]] as a political and military influence.

[[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II]], the last non-Habsburg [[king of Hungary]], moved his royal court to [[Alba Iulia]] in Transylvania, and after his abdication as king of Hungary, became the first [[Prince of Transylvania]]. His Edict of [[Turda]] was the first decree of [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] in the modern history of Europe (1568). In the subsequent period, Transylvania was ruled by mostly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Hungarian princes (until the end of the 17th century), and [[Protestantism]] flourished in the region.

[[Image:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Map of Europe in 1648 showing the three Romanian principalities: Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldova]]

[[Michael the Brave]] (Romanian: Mihai Viteazul) was the [[Prince of Wallachia]] (1593–1601), of [[Rulers of Transylvania|Transylvania]] (1599–1600), and of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavia]] (1600). Briefly, during his reign the three principalities largely inhabited by Romanians were for the first time united under a single rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}{{Citation|last =Rezachevici|first =Constantin|title =Mihai Viteazul: itinerariul moldovean|year =2000|journal=Magazin istoric|issue =5 |url =http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2000/current5/mi5.htm}} {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, as vassal tributary states, [[Moldova]] and [[Wallachia]] had complete internal autonomy and an external independence, which was finally lost in the 18th century. In 1600, the principalities of Wallachia, Moldova and Transylvania were simultaneously headed by the Wallachian prince [[Mihai Viteazul|Michael the Brave]] (''Mihai Viteazul''), [[Ban (title)|Ban]] of [[Oltenia]], but the chance for a unity dissolved after Mihai was killed, only one year later, by the soldiers of an [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] army general [[Giorgio Basta]]. Mihai Viteazul, who was prince of Transylvania for less than one year, intended for the first time to unite the three principalities and to lay down foundations of a single state in a territory comparable to today's Romania.

The [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1811)|Principality of Transylvania]] experienced a golden age under the [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] rule of [[Gabor Bethlen]] (1613–1629). In 1699, Transylvania became a territory of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs']] Austrian empire, following the Austrian victory over the Turks. The Austrians, in their turn, rapidly expanded their empire: in 1718 an important part of Wallachia, called [[Oltenia]], was incorporated to the Austrian monarchy and was only returned in 1739. In 1775, the Austrian empire occupied the north-western part of Moldavia, later called [[Bukovina]], while the eastern half of the principality (called [[Bessarabia]]) was occupied in 1812 by [[Russia]].

During the period of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] rule in [[Transylvania]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty over [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], most [[Romanians]] were in the situation of being [[Supplex Libellus Valachorum|second-class citizens]] (or even non-citizens)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher =GenealogyRO Group|title =The Magyarization Process|url =http://www.genealogy.ro/cont/13.htm

As in most European countries, [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 brought revolution]] to Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania, announced by [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] and his [[Pandurs]] in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]]. The goals of the revolutionaries - complete independence for Moldavia and Wallachia, and national emancipation in Transylvania - remained unfulfilled, but were the basis of the subsequent evolutions. Also, the uprising helped the population of the three principalities recognise their unity of language and interests. Moldavia and Romanian countries were very close, not just in language, but in geography also.

After the failed [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]], the [[Great Powers]] did not support the Romanians' expressed desire to officially unite in a single state, forcing Romania to proceed alone against the Turks. Heavily taxed and badly administered under the Ottoman Empire, in 1859, people in both Moldavia and Wallachia elected the same &quot;[[Domnitor]]&quot; (ruler) - [[Alexander John Cuza|Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] - as prince. (''[[Domnitor]]'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Bobango|first =Gerald J|title =The emergence of the Romanian national State
|publisher =Boulder|year =1979|location =New York|isbn =  978-0-914710-51-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Romania was created as a personal union, albeit a Romania that did not include Transylvania, where the upper class and the aristocracy remained mainly Hungarian, although Romanian nationalism inevitably ran up against Hungarian nationalism at the end of the 19th century. As in the previous 900 years, Austria-Hungary, especially under the [[History of Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] of 1867, kept the Hungarians firmly in control, even in parts of Transylvania where Romanians constituted a local majority.

In an 1866 ''coup d'état'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza|Cuza]] was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], who became known as [[Prince Carol of Romania]]. 
He was appointed as [[Domnitor]]—Prince—of the Principality of Romania, as [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]].

In 1877, Romania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire.

During the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]], Romania fought on the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} {{Citation|title =San Stefano Preliminary Treaty|year =1878|url =http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/FOREIGN/stefano.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Romanians before WW1.jpg|thumb|left|Territories inhabited by Romanians before WWI]]
The new state, squeezed between the great powers of the Ottoman, [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires, looked to the West, particularly [[France]], for its cultural, educational, military and administrative models. In 1916 Romania entered [[World War I]] on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] side, after the Entente agreed to recognize Romanian rights over Transylvania, which was part of Austria-Hungary until that time.

In August 1914, when [[World War I]] broke out, Romania declared [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. Two years later, under the pressure of Allies (especially [[France]] desperate to open a new front), on August 14/27 1916 it joined the Allies, for which they were promised support for the accomplishment of national unity, Romania declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Horne|first =Charles F.|year =Horne|title =Ion Bratianu's Declaration of War Delivered to the Austrian Minister in Romania on 28 August 1916|volume =V|publisher =Source Records of the Great War|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/romaniawardeclaration.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian military campaign]] ended in disaster for Romania as the [[Central Powers]] conquered two-thirds of the country and captured or killed the majority of its [[Romanian Army|army]] within four months. Nevertheless, [[Moldova]] remained in Romanian hands after the invading forces were stopped in 1917. In May 1918, Romania was in no position to continue the war, and negotiated a peace treaty with [[German Empire|Germany]] (see [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918]]). In October 1918, Romania joined the war again and by the end of the war, the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires had disintegrated; governing bodies created by the Romanians of Transylvania, Bessarabia and Bukovina chose union with the [[Kingdom of Romania]], resulting in [[Greater Romania]].
and since by the war's end, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire had collapsed, [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]] were allowed to unite with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1918. By the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], [[Hungary]] renounced in favour of Romania all the claims of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] over [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Trianon|title=Text of the Treaty of Trianon|publisher=World War I Document Archive|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union of Romania with [[Bukovina]] was ratified in 1919 in the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=treaty+of+st+germain+text+bukovina|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia|author=Bernard Anthony Cook|page=162|isbn=0-8153-4057-5|year=2001|publisher=Taylor&amp;Francis|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Bessarabia]] in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1920)|Treaty of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Legal Status of the Bukovina and Bessarabia|author=Malbone W.

== Greater Romania ==
;(1918–1940)
{{Main|Greater Romania}}

[[Image:Romania MASSR 1920.png|thumb|300px|Great Romania (1920 - 1940)]]
The Romanian expression [[Greater Romania|România Mare]] (literal translation &quot;Great Romania&quot;, but more commonly rendered &quot;Greater Romania&quot;) generally refers to the Romanian state in the [[interwar period]], and by extension, to the territory Romania covered at the time (see map). Romania achieved at that time its greatest territorial extent (almost {{convert|300000|km2|sqmi|disp=s|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://media.ici.ro/history/ist08.htm Statul National Unitar (România Mare 1919 - 1940)]&lt;/ref&gt;), managing to unite all the historic Romanian lands. Historically, Greater Romania—''România Mare''—represented one of the ideals of Romanian [[nationalism]]. Greater Romania is still seen by many as a &quot;paradise lost&quot;, often by comparison with the &quot;stunted&quot; [[Communist Romania]]. To exploit the nationalistic connotation of the term, a [[Greater Romania Party|nationalist political party]] uses it as its name.

In 1918, at the end of [[World War I]], Transylvania and Bessarabia united with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. The Deputies of the Romanians from Transylvania voted to unite their region by the ''Proclamation of Union'' of [[Alba Iulia]]. Bessarabia, having declared its independence from Russia in 1917 by the Conference of the Country ([[Sfatul Țării]]), called in Romanian troops to protect the province from the [[Bolshevik]]s who were spreading the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. The union of the regions of Transylvania, [[Maramureș]], [[Crișana]] and [[Banat]] with the Old Kingdom of Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which recognised the sovereignty of Romania over these regions and settled the border between the independent Republic of Hungary and the Kingdom of Romania. The union of [[Bucovina]] and Bessarabia with Romania was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Romania had also recently acquired the [[Southern Dobruja]] territory called &quot;The Quadrilateral&quot; from [[Bulgaria]] as a result of its participation in the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913.
[[Image:Alba Iulia Resolution.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Union between Transylvania and Romania]]
[[Image:Greater Romania histprov.svg|thumb|left|300px|Administrative map of Greater Romania in 1930. the colors represent the historical regions (no administrative value)]]

The Union of 1918 united most regions with clear Romanian majorities into the boundaries of a single state. However, it also led to the inclusion of various sizable minorities, including [[Magyars]] (ethnic Hungarians), [[German people|Germans]], [[Jew]]s, [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Bulgarians]], etc., for a total of about 28% of the population (Magyars mostly in Transylvania; Germans in Transylvania, Bukovina, and Banat; Ukrainians in part of Bessarabia and Bukovina, Bulgarians in Dobrudja). Recognized by the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|Romanian Constitution of 1923]] and supported by various laws (education, electoral, etc.), national minorities were represented in [[Romanian Parliament|Parliament]], and several of them created national parties (the Magyars in 1922, the Germans in 1929, the Jews in 1931), although a unique standing of minorities with autonomy on a wide basis, provided for at the assembly of Transylvanian Romanians on 1 December 1918 were not fulfilled.

Two periods can be identified in Romania between the two World Wars. From 1918 to 1938, Romania was a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[constitutional monarchy]], but one facing the rise of the nationalist, [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] parties, particularly [[Iron Guard]], which won about 15% of the votes in the general elections of 1937. From 1938 to 1944, Romania was a dictatorship. The first dictator was [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]], who abolished the parliamentary regime and ruled with his ''camarilla.''

In 1939, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], which stipulated, amongst other things, the Soviet &quot;interest&quot; in Bessarabia. Following the severe territorial losses of 1940 (''see next section''), Carol was forced to abdicate, replaced as king by his son [[Mihai of Romania|Mihai]], but the power was taken by the military dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] (initially in conjunction with the Iron Guard). In August 1944, Antonescu was arrested by Mihai.

{{Main|Romania during World War II|Bombing of Romania in World War II}}

During the Second World War, Romania tried again to remain neutral, but on June 28, 1940, it received a [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet ultimatum]] with an implied threat of [[invasion]] in the event of non-compliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimatum&quot;&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/istorie1918-1940/13-4.htm Soviet Ultimata and Replies of the Romanian Government] in Ioan Scurtu, Theodora Stănescu-Stanciu, Georgiana Margareta Scurtu, ''Istoria Românilor între anii 1918-1940'' (in Romanian), [[University of Bucharest]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from [[Moscow]] and [[Berlin]], the Romanian administration and the army were forced to retreat from [[Bessarabia]] as well from [[Northern Bukovina]] to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nagy-Talavera|first=Nicolas M.|title=Green Shirts and Others: a History of Fascism in Hungary and Romania|year=1970|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in combination with other factors, prompted the government to join the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]. Thereafter, southern [[Dobruja]] was awarded to Bulgaria, while Hungary received [[Northern Transylvania]] as result of an [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

In 1940, Romania lost territory in both east and west: In June 1940, after receiving an ultimatum from the [[Soviet Union]], Romania ceded [[Bessarabia]] and northern [[Bukovina]]&lt;ref&gt;Istvan Deak, ''Essays on Hitler's Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8032-6630-8, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Y.

Two thirds of Bessarabia were combined with a small part of the USSR to form the [[Moldavian SSR]]. Northern Bukovina and [[Budjak]] were apportioned to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. In August 1940, [[Northern Transylvania]] was awarded to Hungary by [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] through the [[Second Vienna Award]]. [[Southern Dobruja]] was also lost to Bulgaria shortly after Carol's abdication.

Because Carol II lost so much territory through failed diplomacy, the army supported seizure of power by General [[Ion Antonescu]]. For four months (the period of the [[National Legionary State]]), he had to share power with the Iron Guard, but the latter [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|overplayed their hand in January 1941]] and were suppressed. Romania entered [[World War II]] under the command of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in June 1941, declaring war to the Soviet Union in order to recover Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. Romania was awarded the territory between [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug]] by Germany to administer it under the name of ''[[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]].''
[[Image:Rom1942.png|thumb|200px|right|Romania's borders during World War II (1941-1944)]]

The authoritarian [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] [[abdicated]] in 1940, succeeded by the [[National Legionary State]], in which power was shared by [[Ion Antonescu]] and the [[Iron Guard]]. Within months, Antonescu had crushed the [[Iron Guard]], and the subsequent year Romania entered the war on the side of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. During the war, Romania was the most important source of oil for [[Nazi Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/mistakes.htm#ploesti|title=The Biggest Mistakes In World War 2:Ploesti - the most important target|accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting [[Operation Tidal Wave|multiple bombing raids]] by the [[Allies]].

[[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] following World War II led to the formation of a [[communism|communist]] People's Republic in 1947, and the abdication of King Michael, who went into exile. The leader of Romania from 1948 to his death in 1965 was [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], the [[General Secretary|First Secretary]] of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]], who first sowed the seeds of greater independence from the Soviet Union by persuading Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev to withdraw troops from Romania in April 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Granville, [http://www.scribd.com/doc/17679545/DejAVu-Early-Roots-of-Romanias-Independence-by-Johanna-Granville &quot;''Dej''-a-Vu: Early Roots of Romania's Independence,&quot;] ''East European Quarterly'', vol. XLII, no. 4 (Winter 2008), pp. 365-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the negotiated retreat of Soviet troops, Romania, under the new leadership of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], started to pursue independent policies, including the condemnation of the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] (Romania being the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country not to take part in the invasion), the continuation of diplomatic relations with [[Israel]] after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 (again, the only Warsaw Pact country to do so), and the establishment of economic (1963) and diplomatic (1967) relations with the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm &quot;countrystudies.us - Romania: Soviet Union and Eastern Europe&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, close ties with the [[Arab]] countries (and the [[PLO]]) allowed Romania to play a key role in the [[Israel]]-[[Egypt]] and Israel-[[PLO]] peace processes by intermediating the visit of [[Sadat]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/romania/80.htm &quot;countrystudies.us: Middle East policies in Communist Romania&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; As Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from 3 to 10 billion US dollars),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Deletant|first = Dennis|title=New Evidence on Romania and the Warsaw Pact, 1955-1989|publisher=Cold War International History Project e-Dossier Series|url =http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=topics.publications&amp;doc_id=16367&amp;group_id=13349}}&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of international financial organisations such as the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]] grew, conflicting with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s [[autarky|autarchic]] policies. Ceauşescu eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt (completed in 1989, shortly before his overthrow). To achieve this goal, he imposed policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy. He greatly extended the authority of the [[Securitate|police state]] and imposed a [[cult of personality]]. These led to a dramatic decrease in Ceauşescu's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and execution in the bloody [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].

Seduced by Ceauşescu's &quot;Independent&quot; foreign policy, Western leaders were slow to turn against a regime that, by the late 1970s, had become increasingly arbitrary, capricious and harsh. Rapid economic growth fueled by foreign credits gradually gave way to wrenching austerity and severe political repression, which became increasingly draconian through the 1980s. During the 1947–1962 period, many people were arbitrarily killed or imprisoned for political, economic or unknown reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}{{Citation|last =Caraza|first =Grigore|title =Aiud însângerat|publisher =Editura Vremea XXI|year=2004|volume=IV|series =Chapter|isbn=973-645-050-3|url=http://www.procesulcomunismului.com/marturii/fonduri/gcaraza/aiud/docs/cap4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; detainees in prisons or camps, deported persons, persons under house arrest, and administrative detainees.

== 1989 Revolution ==
{{Main|Romanian Revolution of 1989}}

The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in [[Timişoara]] and [[Bucharest]], and brought about the fall of Ceauşescu and the end of the Communist regime in Romania. After a weeklong state of unrest in Timişoara, a mass rally summoned in Bucharest in support of Ceauşescu on December 21, 1989 turned hostile. The Ceauşescu couple, fleeing Bucharest by helicopter, ended up in the custody of the army. After being tried and convicted by a [[kangaroo court]] for [[genocide]] and other crimes, they were executed on December 25, 1989. The events of this revolution remain to this day a matter of debate, with many conflicting theories as to the motivations and even actions of some of the main players.

[[Ion Iliescu]], a former Communist Party official marginalized by Ceauşescu, attained national recognition as the leader of an impromptu governing coalition, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN) that proclaimed the restoration of democracy and civil liberties on December 22, 1989. The Communist Party was initially outlawed by Ion Iliescu, but he soon revoked that decision; as a consequence, Communism is not outlawed in Romania today. However, Ceauşescu's most controversial measures, such as bans on [[abortion]] and [[contraception]], were among the first laws to be changed after the Revolution, and their legality has not been widely questioned since then.

== Transition to free market ==
;(1990–2004)
{{Main|Romania since 1989}}

After the fall of Ceauşescu, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), led by [[Ion Iliescu]], took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Carothers| first= Thomas |title= Romania: The Political Background  |url= http://www.idea.int/publications/country/upload/Romania,%20The%20Political%20Background.pdf |quote= &quot;This seven-year period can be characterized as a gradualistic, often ambiguous transition away from communist rule towards democracy.&quot;|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| unused_data=Transitions World Politics - Volume 50, Number 2, January 1998, pp. 203-234| last=Hellman| first=Joel| title= Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major political parties of the pre-war era, such as the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|National Christian Democrat Peasant's Party (PNŢCD)]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party (PNL)]] and the [[Romanian Social Democrat Party|Romanian Social Democrat Party (PSDR)]] were resurrected. After several major political rallies (especially in January), in April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of the recently held parliamentary elections began in [[University Square, Bucharest]]. The protesters accused the FSN of being made up of former Communists and members of the [[Securitate]]. The protesters did not recognize the results of the election, which they deemed undemocratic, and were asking for the exclusion from the political life of the former high-ranking Communist Party members. The protest rapidly grew to become an ongoing mass demonstration (known as the [[Golaniad]]). The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, with some of the protesters attacking the police headquarters, national television station, and the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deletant&quot;&gt;[http://d.yimg.com/kq/groups/21010417/803473086/name/Carey_final.pdf Deletant, Dennnis. &quot;The Security Services since 1989: Turning over a new leaf.&quot; (2004) Carey, Henry F.

But the most visible and politically influential were the coal miners of the [[Jiu River|Jiu Valley]]. After representatives of the government met with leaders of the [[League of Miners Unions of the Jiu Valley|Jiu Valley coal miners union]], thousands of miners were organized and arrived in Bucharest June 14.

Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on May 20, 1990. Running against representatives of the re-established pre-war [[National Peasants' Party]] and [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], and taking advantage of FSN's tight control of the national radio and television, Iliescu won 85% of the vote. The FSN secured two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. A university professor with strong family roots in the Communist Party, [[Petre Roman]], was named prime minister of the new government, which consisted mainly of former communist officials. The government initiated modest [[free market]] reforms.

Because the majority of ministers in the Petre Roman government were ex-communists, anti-communist protesters initiated [[Golaniad|a round-the-clock anti-government demonstration]] in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]], Bucharest in April 1990. Two months later, these protesters, whom the government referred to as &quot;hooligans&quot;, were brutally dispersed by the miners from [[Jiu Valley]], called in by President Iliescu; this event became known as the [[mineriad]] (see [[June 1990 Mineriad]]). The facts surrounding these events are disputed by the miners, who claim that most of the [[June 1990 Mineriad#Inquiry into potential involvement of the Romanian Intelligence Service|violence was perpetrated by government agents]] that were agitating the crowds. Some of the counter-protesters also attacked the headquarters and private residences of opposition leaders. Later Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and in June 1994 a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deletant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baleanu&quot;&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/romania/g43.html  Baleanu, V G.  ''The Enemy Within: The Romanian Intelligence Service in Transition.'' January 1995. Conflict Studies Research Centre, The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst: Camberley, Surrey GU15 4PQ.]&lt;/ref&gt; Petre Roman's government fell in late September 1991, when the miners returned to Bucharest to demand higher salaries. A technocrat, [[Theodor Stolojan]], was appointed to head an interim government until new elections could be held.

In December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum, which, however, attracted criticism from international observers who accused the government of manipulating the population and even of outright fraud. (The constitution was most recently revised by a national referendum on October 18–19, 2003, again plagued by fraud accusations made by internal and international observers.) The new constitution, which took effect October 29, 2003, follows the structure of the Constitution of 1991, but makes significant revisions, among which the most significant are extension of the presidential mandate from four years to five, and the guaranteed protection of private property.

March 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic National Front]] (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. [[Red Quadrilateral|With parliamentary support]] from the nationalist PUNR (National Unity Party of Romanians), PRM ([[Great Romania Party]]), and the ex-communist PSM (Socialist Workers' Party), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister [[Nicolae Văcăroiu]], an economist. The FDSN changed its name to [[Party of Social Democracy in Romania]] (PDSR) in July 1993.

The subsequent disintegration of the FSN produced several political parties including the Romanian Democrat Social Party (PDSR, later  [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], PSD), the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD) and the ApR ([[List of political parties in Romania#Other post-1989 parties|Alliance for Romania]]). The PDSR party governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then there have been three democratic changes of government: in 1996, the democratic-liberal opposition and its leader [[Emil Constantinescu]] acceded to power; in 2000 the Social Democrats returned to power, with [[Iliescu]] once again president; and in 2004 [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected president, with an electoral coalition called [[Justice and Truth|Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA). The government was formed by a larger coalition which also includes the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] and the [[UDMR|ethnic Hungarian party]].

[[Emil Constantinescu]] of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] (CDR) emerged as the winner of the second round of the 1996 presidential elections and replaced Iliescu as chief of state. The PDSR won the largest number of seats in Parliament, but was unable to form a viable coalition. Constituent parties of the CDR joined the Democratic Party (PD), the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania]] (UDMR) to form a centrist coalition government, holding 60% of the seats in Parliament. This coalition of sorts frequently struggled for survival, as decisions were often delayed by long periods of negotiations among the involved parties. Nevertheless, this coalition was able to implement several critical reforms. The new coalition government, under prime minister [[Victor Ciorbea]] remained in office until March 1998, when  [[Radu Vasile]] (PNŢCD) took over as prime minister.  The former governor of the National Bank, [[Mugur Isărescu]], eventually replaced [[Radu Vasile]] as head of the government.

The [[Romanian elections, 2000|2000 elections]], brought Iliescu's PDSR, known as [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) after the merger with the PSDR, back to power. Iliescu won a third term as the country's president. [[Adrian Năstase]] became the prime minister of the newly formed government.

== European Union membership ==
;(2004–present)
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
{{Main|Accession of Romania to the European Union|Romanian membership of the European Union|2012 Romanian protests}}

Presidential and parliamentary elections took place again on November 28, 2004. No political party was able to secure a viable parliamentary majority and opposition parties alike that the PSD had committed large-scale electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;http://neovox.cortland.edu/archives/2004/12/the_romanian_el.html&lt;/ref&gt; There was no winner in the first round of the presidential elections. The joint PNL-PD candidate, [[Traian Băsescu]], won the second round on December 12, 2004 with 51% of the vote and thus became the third post-revolutionary president of Romania.

The PNL leader, [[Călin Popescu Tăriceanu]] was assigned the difficult task of building a coalition government without including the PSD. In December 2004, the new coalition government (PD, PNL, PUR [[Romanian Humanist Party]] - which eventually changed its name to [[Romanian Conservative Party]] and UDMR), was sworn in under Prime Minister Tăriceanu.

Post–[[Cold War]] Romania developed closer ties with [[Western Europe]], eventually joining [[NATO]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =NATO update: NATO welcomes seven new members|url =http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/04-april/e0402a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU). It became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=BBC News: EU approves Bulgaria and Romania|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5380024.stm | date=September 26, 2006 | accessdate=January 5, 2010|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the free travel agreement and politic of the post–Cold War period, as well as hardship of the life in the post 1990s economic depression, Romania has an [[Romanian diaspora|increasingly large diaspora]]. The main emigration targets are Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, UK, Canada and the USA.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Romania joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] in 2004, and the [[European Union]], alongside [[Bulgaria]], on January 1, 2007.

In April 2008, Bucharest hosted the [[2008 Bucharest summit|NATO summit]].

In January 2012, Romania started the first [[2012 Romanian protests|large national protests]] since '89, motivated by the global economical crisis of that time and as an answer to the [[Crisis situations and unrest in Europe since 2000|crisis situations and unrest in Europe of 2000s]].
