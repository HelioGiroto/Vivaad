'''LGBT history''' refers to the history of [[lesbian]], [[gay (term)|gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) peoples and cultures around the world, dating back to the first recorded instances of same-sex love and sexuality of [[Ancient history|ancient civilizations]]. What survives of many centuries' persecution– resulting in shame, suppression, and secrecy– has only recently been pursued and interwoven into historical narrative. In 1994 the first month-long annual observance [[LGBT History Month]] began in the US and has been picked up by other countries. They cover the history of the people,  [[List of LGBT rights by region|LGBT rights]] and related [[civil rights]] movements. It is observed during October in the United States, to include [[National Coming Out Day]] on October 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;glsen&quot;&gt;[http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/educator/library/record/816.html LGBT History Month Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, it is observed during February, to coincide with a major celebration of the 2005 abolition of [[Section 28]], which had prohibited schools from discussing LGBT issues or counseling LGBT or [[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Local+Government+Act+&amp;Year=2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=819204&amp;ActiveTextDocId=819364&amp;filesize=374 Local Government Act 2003 (c. 26) – Statute Law Database&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880009_en_5.htm Local Government Act 1988 (c. 9)], section 28.

==Ancient history==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history}}
Among historical figures, some were recorded as having relations with others of their own sex — exclusively or together with opposite-sex relations — while others were recorded as only having relations with the opposite sex. However, there are instances of same-sex love and sexuality within almost all ancient civilizations. Additionally, Transgender and [[third sex]] peoples have been recorded in almost all cultures across human history.

===Classical antiquity in Europe===
{{Main|Homosexuality in Ancient Greece|Homosexuality in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Kiss Briseis Painter Louvre G278 full.jpg|thumb|Male couple ([[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|''erastes'' and ''eromenos'']]) kissing ''([[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figured cup]], ca. 480 BC)'']]
The earliest documents concerning same-sex relationships come from [[Ancient Greece]]. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and beside it. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate (with exceptions such as [[Alexander the Great]] and the same-aged  [[Hephaestion]]) but the older man would usually be the ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastes]]'' (lover) to a young ''[[eromenos]]'' (loved one). The ideal held that both partners would be inspired by love symbolized by [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], the erastes unselfishly providing education, guidance, and appropriate gifts to his eromenos, who became his devoted pupil and assistant, while the sexuality theoretically remained short of penetrative acts and supposedly would consist primarily of the act of [[frot]]tage or [[intercrural sex]].  Although this was the ideal, realistically speaking, it is probable that in many such  relationships [[fellatio]] and penetrative [[anal intercourse]] did occur. The hoped-for result was the mutual improvement of both erastes and eromenos, each doing his best to excel in order to be worthy of the other. If one was open about one's homosexuality then they were exiled or in some cases executed because it was regarded as a duty to one's [[ethnic group]] to reproduce. [[Kenneth J. Dover]], followed by [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Halperin]], assumed that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. However, Dover's claim has been questioned in light of evidence of [[love poetry]] which suggests a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed [[semen]], more specifically [[sperm]], to be the source of knowledge, and that these relationships served to pass [[wisdom]] on from the erastes to the eromenos within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanggaard |first=Thorkil |title=Phallos. A Symbol and its History in the Male World |publisher=New York: International Universities Press, Inc. |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-8236-8192-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Greece and [[Phrygia]], and later in the [[Roman Republic]], the Goddess [[Cybele]] was worshiped by a cult of people who [[castration|castrated]] themselves, and thereafter took female dress and referred to themselves as female.&lt;ref name=Califia&gt;[[Patrick Califia|Califia, Patrick]] (2003) ''Sex Changes The Politics of Transgenderism'', [[Cleis Press]] INC., California, [[ISDN]] 1-57344-180-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Banjamin&gt;[[Harry Benjamin|Benjamin, H.]] (1966). The Transsexual Phenomenon. Julian Press: New York&lt;/ref&gt; These early transsexual figures have also been referred to as early gay role models by several authors.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;[[Arthur Evans|Evans, Arthur.]] (1978) ''Witchraft and Gay counterculture,'' [[Boston]]: Fag Rag Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conner&gt;[[Randy Conner|Conner, R.]] (1993) ''Blossom of Bone'' San Francisco, Harper&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman patriarchal society, it was socially acceptable for an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizen]] to take the penetrative role in same-sex relations. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|Freeborn male minors]] were strictly protected from sexual predators (see ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''), and men who willingly played the &quot;passive&quot; role in homosexual relations were disparaged. No law or moral censure was directed against homosexual behaviors as such, as long as the citizen took the dominant role with a partner [[Social class in ancient Rome|of lower status]] such as a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]], [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]], or someone considered ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infamis]]'', of no social standing. 

Attitudes toward homosexual behavior changed when the Empire fell under Christian rule; see for instance [[Sodomy#Justinian I and Byzantine power politics of late antiquity|legislation of Justinian I]].

===Ancient China and Japan===
{{Main|Homosexuality in China|Homosexuality in Japan|Shudō}}

Homosexuality has been acknowledged in China since ancient times. Scholar Pan Guangdan (潘光旦) came to the conclusion that nearly every [[Emperor of China|emperor]] in the [[Han Dynasty]] had one or more [[catamite|male sex partners]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed. [[Wayne Dynes]], ''Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990, pp216&lt;/ref&gt; There are also descriptions of lesbians in some history books. It is believed homosexuality was popular in the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese homosexuals did not experience high-profile persecution as compared with that which was received by homosexuals in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990, p218&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex love was celebrated in Chinese art, many examples of which have survived the book burnings of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls and [[Chinese painting|paintings]] on silk can be found in private collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androphile.org/preview/Museum/China/NEWindex.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, several [[Heian period|Heian]] diaries which contain references to homosexual acts exist as well. Some of these also contain references to [[Emperor of Japan|emperors]] involved in homosexual relationships and to &quot;handsome boys retained for sexual purposes&quot; by emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990, p6352&lt;/ref&gt; In other literary works can be found references to what Leupp has called &quot;problems of gender identity&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} such as the story of a youth's falling in love with a girl who is actually a [[cross-dressing]] male. Japanese ''[[shunga]]'' are erotic pictures which include same-sex and opposite-sex love.

===South Asia===
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}
In South Asia the ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]'' are a caste of third-gender, or transgender group who live a feminine role. Hijra may be born male or [[intersex]], and some may have been born female.

===South Pacific===
In many societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were, until the middle of the last century, an integral part of the culture. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a pre-pubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would &quot;inseminate&quot; him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards pederasty and same-sex relationships since the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries.&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
{{Further2|[[LGBT topics and Islam]], [[LGBT topics and Judaism]]}}
[[File:Samarkand A group of musicians playing for a bacha dancing boy.jpg|thumb|''Dance of a [[bacchá]] (dancing boy)''&lt;br /&gt; [[Samarkand]], (ca 1905–1915), photo [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]]. [[Library of Congress]], Washington, DC.]]
Among many Middle Eastern Muslim cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. The practice of bacha bazi is one among many forms of [[pederasty]] ubiquitous in the Muslim world. In pre-modern Islam there was a &quot;widespread conviction that beardless youths possessed a temptation to adult men as a whole, and not merely to a small minority of deviants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;El-Rouayheb, 2005. Op.cit. p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent scholars of Islam, such as [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained [[capital punishment]] for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fatwa IslamOnline&quot;&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556 Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions] Fatwa on Homosexuality from IslamOnline.net&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most Muslim-majority countries. In the Islamic regimes of Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, homosexual activity is punished with the death penalty. In Nigeria and Somalia the death penalty is issued in some regions.&lt;ref name = ILGAMAP&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_map_2009_A4.pdf ILGA: Lesbian and Gay Rights in the World (2009)].&lt;/ref&gt; The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment such as [[imprisonment]]. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RoughGuideSEAsia2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=http://www.roughguides.com/|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|ISBN=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]] this is not the case. A tradition of art and literature sprang up constructing Middle Eastern homosexuality. Muslim—often [[Sufi]]—poets in medieval Arab lands and in [[Iran|Persia]] wrote odes to the beautiful wine boys who served them in the taverns. In many areas the practice survived into modern times, as documented by [[Richard Francis Burton]], [[André Gide]], and others. [[Homoerotic]] themes were present in poetry and other literature written by some Muslims from the medieval period onwards and which celebrated love between men. In fact these were more common than expressions of attraction to women.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', MacMillan Reference USA, 2004, p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

Egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, [[Mauritania]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 ILGA:7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Though often ignored or suppressed by European explorers and colonialists, homosexual expression in native Africa was also present and took a variety of forms. Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned &quot;long term, erotic relationships,&quot; named ''motsoalle.''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O. Murray |coauthors=[[Will Roscoe|Roscoe, Will]] (ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-23829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] also recorded that male [[Azande]] warriors (in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]) routinely took on boy-wives between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in intercrural sex with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders he spoke to.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard, E. E.]] (December 1970). Sexual Inversion among the Azande. American Anthropologist, New Series, 72(6), 1428–1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Middle Ages==
{{main|Homosexuality in medieval Europe}}
Same-sex scholarly 'empires of the mind' were common in medieval Arabic cultures, as seen in their poetry on same-sex love.

According to [[John Boswell (historian)|John Boswell]], author of ''Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality'',&lt;ref&gt;New Haven: [[Yale University Press]] (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; there were same-sex Christian monastic communities and other [[religious order]]s in which homosexuality thrived. According to Chauncey et al. (1989), the book &quot;offered a revolutionary interpretation of the [[Western culture|Western tradition]], arguing that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had not condemned [[Homosexuality|gay people]] throughout its history, but rather, at least until the twelfth century, had alternately evinced no special concern about homosexuality or actually celebrated love between men.&quot;
Boswell was also the author of ''Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe'' (New York: Villard, 1994) in which he argues that the ''adelphopoiia'' liturgy was evidence that attitude of the Christian church towards homosexuality has changed over time, and that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] did on occasion accept same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/index-bos.html John Boswell page; &quot;People with a History: An Online Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans* History &quot;] [[Fordham University]]; 1997. Retrieved January 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, notably [[R. W. Southern]], dispute Boswell's findings and scholarly rigor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} His work attracted great controversy, as it was seen by many as merely an attempt for Boswell to justify his homosexuality and Roman Catholic faith. For instance, R. W. Southern points out that homosexuality had been condemned extensively by religious leaders and medieval scholars well before the 12th century; he also points to the [[penitential]]s which were common in early medieval society, and many of which include homosexuality as among the serious sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boswell Thesis: Essays on Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality|author=Mathew Kuefler|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-226-45741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Need to add reference to the Englishman who lived as a woman, in French courts, and had an insurance and court battle over whether she was male or female ~~~~ --&gt;

Bennett and Froide, in &quot;Singlewomen in the European Past&quot;, note: &quot;Other
single women found emotional comfort and [[Sexual arousal|sexual pleasure]] with women. The
history of same-sex relations between women in medieval and early modern
Europe is exceedingly difficult to study, but there can be no doubt of its
existence. Church leaders worried about lesbian sex; women expressed,
practiced, and were sometimes imprisoned or even executed for same-sex love;
and some women cross-dressed in order to live with other women as married
couples.&quot; They go on to note that even the seemingly modern word &quot;lesbian&quot;
has been traced back as far as 1732, and discuss lesbian subcultures, but
add, &quot;Nevertheless, we certainly should not equate the single state with
lesbian practices.&quot; While same-sex relationships among men were highly
documented and condemned, &quot;Moral theologians did not pay much attention to
the question of what we would today call lesbian sex, perhaps because
anything that did not involve a phallus did not fall within the bounds of
their understanding of the sexual. Some legislation against lesbian
relations can be adduced for the period, mainly
&lt;nowiki&gt;involving&lt;/nowiki&gt; the use of &quot;instruments,&quot; in other words,
[[dildo]]es.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Singlewomen in the European Past
|authorlink=Judith M. Bennett and Amy M. Froide|year=1999|publisher=University
Pennsylvania Press|pages=10–11, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecutions against homosexuality rose during the [[High Middle Ages]], reaching their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of fornication and sodomy, alongside accusations of satanism.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman &quot;The Guilt of the Templars&quot; (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that &quot;special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;civ2&quot;&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003. Page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Renaissance==
The Renaissance saw intense oppression of homosexual relationships by the Roman Catholic Church. Homosexual activity radically passes from being completely legal in the most of Europe to incurring the death penalty in most European states.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (1980) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France in the Middle Ages|France]], first-offending sodomites lost their testicles, second offenders lost their penis, and third offenders were burned. Women caught in same-sex acts could be mutilated and executed as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fone&quot;&gt;Fone, Byrne R. S. (2000). Homophobia: a history. New York: Metropolitan Books. ISBN 0-8050-4559-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] argues that sodomy is second only to murder in the ranking of sins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fone&quot;/&gt; The church used every means at its disposal to fight what it considered to be the &quot;corruption of [[sodomy]]&quot;. Men were fined or jailed; boys were flogged. The harshest punishments, such as [[burning at the stake]], were usually reserved for crimes committed against the very young, or by violence. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] begins in 1480, sodomites were stoned, castrated, and burned. Between 1540 and 1700, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for sodomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fone&quot;/&gt; In 1532 the [[Holy Roman Empire]] made sodomy punishable by death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fone&quot;/&gt; The following year King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] passed the [[Buggery Act 1533]] making all male-male sexual activity punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Jacobs'' (1817) Russ &amp; Ry 331 confirmed that buggery related only to intercourse ''[[anal sex|per anum]]'' by a man with a man or woman or intercourse ''per anum'' or ''[[vaginal sex|per vaginum]]'' by either [[bestiality|a man or a woman with an animal]]. Other forms of &quot;unnatural intercourse&quot; may amount to [[indecent assault]] or [[Gross indecency (disambiguation)|gross indecency]], but do not constitute buggery. See generally, Smith &amp; Hogan, ''Criminal Law'' (10th ed), ISBN 0-406-94801-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florentine homosexuality===
[[Florence]] had a widespread homosexual culture, which included age-structured relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Milner, ''At the Margins: Minority Groups in Premodern Italy'', Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8166-3820-9, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1432 the city established ''Gli Ufficiali di Notte'' (The Officers of the Night) to root out the practice of sodomy. From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: &quot;If you crave joys, tumble some boys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Florentine proverb, ca. 1480. After [[Sabadino degli Arienti]] in ''Le Porretane.''Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence,'' Oxford, 1996; p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Association of homosexuality with foreignness====
The reputation of Florence is also reflected in the fact that the Germans adopted the word ''Florenzer'' to refer to a &quot;sodomite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', ISBN 978-0-19-512292-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', ISBN 978-0-19-505696-9&lt;/ref&gt; The association of foreignness with homosexuality gradually became a cornerstone of homophobic rhetoric throughout Europe, and it was used in a calumnious perspective. For example, the French would call &quot;homosexuality&quot; the &quot;Italian vice&quot; in the 16th and 17th centuries, the &quot;English vice&quot; in the 18th century, the ''mœurs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the &quot;German vice&quot; starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Revenin, '''Homosexualité et prostitution masculines à Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
The Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.

==Europe==

===Psychology and terminology shifts===
The developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since 1790s with Johann Valentin Müller’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127–152. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of “criminals,” looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify “pederasts” affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;&gt;Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127–152.&lt;/ref&gt; François Charles’s exposé, Les Deux Prostitutions: études du pathologie sociale, (The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology) developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. Kraftt-Ebing’s 1886 publication, Psychopathia Sexualis,was the most widely translated work of this kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt;  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Kraft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt;

Degeneracy became widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th Century. Benedict Augustin Morel is considered the father of degeneracy theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt;

An important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology’s inquisition into homosexuality.  “Contrary sexual feeling,”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; as Westphal’s phrased, and the word “homosexual” itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term “sodomy” and the elusive “abomination.”  As Michel Foucault phrases, “the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt;

An addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of &quot;gay and lesbian&quot; every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. In the last decade non-heterosexuals such as bisexuals and those who are trans-gender have been lumped together with gays and lesbians, resulting in the popular GLBT acronym (gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans-gender). But since around 2005 the acronym has evolved at times to LGBT, apparently with the assistance of pro-lesbian lobbying to change the acronym. But the acronym is not set in stone for all publications, and GLBT or LGBT seem to appear interchangeably. It has even appeared as GLBTQ (to include Queer) or even as GLBTQQ (to include both Queer and Questioning).

===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===
[[Molly house]]s appeared in 18th century London and other large cities. A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?—circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down. Molly houses were perhaps the first precursors to the modern [[gay bar]].

===Decriminalization of homosexuality in France===
In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] (and Andorra) adopts a new penal code which no longer criminalizes sodomy. France thus becomes the first West European country to decriminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, Scott (2009). [http://www.wellesley.edu/French/facultyhomepages/gunther/Scott%20Gunther%20-%20The%20Elastic%20Closet.html &quot;The Elastic Closet: A History of Homosexuality in France, 1942–present&quot;] Book about the history of homosexual movements in France (sample chapter available online).

===The emancipation movement in Germany, 1890s–1934===
Prior to the [[Third Reich]], Berlin was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] city, with many gay bars, nightclubs and cabarets. There were even many [[drag (clothing)|drag]] bars where tourists [[heterosexuality|straight]] and gay would enjoy [[drag queen|female impersonation]] acts. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] decried cultural degeneration, [[prostitution]] and [[syphilis]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews. Berlin also had the most active [[LGBT movements|LGBT rights movements]] in the world at the time. Jewish doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] had co-founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious &quot;[[Paragraph 175]]&quot; of the Penal Code that made [[Men who have sex with men|sex between men]] illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international GLBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]]. It had a [[research library]] and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for [[civil rights]] and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.

===Oscar Wilde===
[[Oscar Wilde]], the Irish author and playwright played an important role in bringing homosexuality into the public eye. His scandal in British Society and subsequent court case from 1885–6 was highly discussed not only in Europe, but also in America, although newspapers like the New York Times concentrated on the question of blackmail, only alluding to the homosexual aspects as having “a curious meaning,” in the first publication on April 4, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;OSCAR WILDE PLAINTIFF:Cynicisms on Literature and Manners in an English Court.

Retrieved February 1, 2010, from ProQuest Historical Newspapers ''The New York Times'' (1851–2006).&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilde’s arrest, the April 6 ''New York Times'' discussed Wilde’s case as a question of “immorality” and did not specifically address homosexuality, discussing the men “some as young as 18” that were brought up as witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;OSCAR WILDE IMPRISONED:Worse Than Failure Comes of His Suit for Vindication.

===Pre-contact North America===
Prior to western contact, many{{Quantify|date=April 2010}} [[Native Americans in the United States|American Native]] tribes had [[third-gender]] roles.&lt;ref name=Califia/&gt; These include &quot;[[berdache]]s&quot; (a derogatory term for genetic males who assumed a feminine role) and &quot;passing women&quot; (genetic females who took on a masculine role). The term &quot;berdache&quot; is not a Native American word; rather it was a European definition covering a range of third-gender people in different tribes. The proper term for these individuals is [[Two-Spirit]]ed. Not all Native American tribes had transgender people.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;[[Jonathan Katz|Katz, J.]] (1976) ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' New York: [[Thomas Y. Crowell]] Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
Anthropologists{{Who|date=August 2010}} had observed that relatively uncompetitive, less complex cultures such as those that do not distinguish or reward the best hunters in distinction to the other men in the tribe have virtually no homosexuality. One female-born [[Mohave people|Mohave]] berdache (known as a ''hwame'') is known to have been murdered. Sahaykwisa told other Mohaves that he had been turned into a man by white man's magic, and took several female lovers. Sahaykwisa was raped, and later murdered by a group of men.&lt;ref name=Califia/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;[[Walter L. Williams|Williams, Walter L.]], (1986) ''The Spirit and the Flesh: Sexual Diversity in American Indian Culture'', Boston: Beacon Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackson Katz]]&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt; puts forth that there is documentation of &quot;intimate relationships between two males, often of a lifelong character&quot;, and &quot;homosexual relations between adults and youths&quot; ([[Pederasty]])

===18th and 19th Century===

Before the American Civil War and the massive population growth of the Post-Civil War America, the majority of the American population was rural. Without major urban centers to foster sexual subcultures, no self-conscious homosexual subculture could form. With no access to alternative opinions to religious, legal, and social castigations, the culture treatment of homosexuality as a sickness, a sin, and a criminal act would be internalized by homosexuals— keeping homosexuality suppressed personally and culturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;&gt;Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69–84. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality remained unseen and taboo concept in society. In fact, the word “homosexuality” was not coined as a word till 1868 by German-Hungarian [[Karoly Maria Kertbeny]] (who advocated decriminalization).&lt;ref&gt;EEdsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69–84. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, homosexuality fell under the umbrella term “sodomy” that comprised all forms of nonproductive sexuality (masturbation and oral sex were sometimes excluded). Without urban sub-cultures or even a name for self-definition, communal solidarity and self-consciousness was impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

Mainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] (even though the sins of the city are not detailed well) were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of “sodomy.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of “buggery,” and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of 18th Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

Pennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for “sodomy” in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, court case language notably shifted from Biblical damnation to a more dispassionate language, such as: “unmentionable” or “abominable” acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; This evasive language moved homosexuality to an absolute taboo in American society, making communal solidarity ever impossible. Aside from sodomy and “attempted sodomy” court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality remained unacknowledged by mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely because of the Victorian notion of female sexuality was that women were not sexually driven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

In a survey of sodomy law enforcement of the 19th Century, a significant minority of cases did not even specify gender of the “victim” and the accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128&quot;&gt;Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117–128. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128&quot;/&gt; This can be attributed to the purity movement which also explains the sharp increase in arrests for prostitution and homosexuality. In response to the visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure were introduced across America as discourse for easier persecution. “Sodomy” laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the 20th Century to specifically address homosexuality (many States during the 20th Century made anal intercourse between men and women legal).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128&quot;/&gt; In some states, these laws would last until the Federal government repealed them in 2004 with the Lawrence decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128&quot;/&gt;

===The Male Ideal and The 19th Century===

Homosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, “a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy’s boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. – fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

New York, as America’s largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800–20 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; He was immediately drawn to young working class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''— “frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love” or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:

&quot;Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

Sometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments— “I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman’s treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt; But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

Twenty years after Whitman came to New York, Horatio Alger continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian self-made man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84&quot;/&gt;

===Late 19th Century===
We'wha was a relatively modern ''Ihamana'' ([[Two-Spirit]]) of the Native American [[Zuni people|Zuni tribe]]. She made a trip to Washington in 1886, and later shook President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s hand. She was revered by her tribe for her skill at weaving and pottery, as well as taking part in community ceremonies and rituals.&lt;ref name=Califia/&gt; Her life was originally documented by anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;Roscoe, W. (1988) &quot;The Zuni Man-Woman&quot;, ''[[Outlook (magazine)| ]]'', Summer 1988, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Early Twentieth Century===
In 1908 the first American defense of homosexuality was published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; This 600 page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson’s view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing’s, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels— ''Imre: A Memorandum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91&quot;&gt;Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to “cure” him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91&quot;/&gt; Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely “spiritual,” but could not escape the “animal.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91&quot;/&gt;

By this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In a 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York’s queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. “Middle class queer,” “fairies,” were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; But with this growing public presence, backlash came naturally. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman’s praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152&quot;/&gt; Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.

===1920s===

[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]
[[Berlin]] was the leading city for homosexuals during the 1920s with clubs and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine [[Die Freundin]] was started by [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] and the gay men magazine [[Der Eigene]] had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine. The first gay demonstration ever took place in [[Nollendorfplatz]] in 1922 in Berlin, gathering 400 homosexuals. The homosexual doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] did many things to improve the situation for gays. Berlin was well known as the decadent city during the 1920s, which is shown in the musical and movie [[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]].

The 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title &quot;Masculine Women, Feminine Men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in Hugh J. Ward's Musical Comedy &quot;Lady Be Good.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:&lt;ref&gt;Artists who recorded this song include: 1. [[Frank Harris]] ([[Irving Kaufman (singer)|Irving Kaufman]]), (Columbia 569D,1/29/26) 2. Bill Meyerl &amp; Gwen Farrar (UK, 1926) 3. Joy Boys (UK, 1926) 4. Harry Reser's [[Six Jumping Jacks]] (UK, 2/13/26) 5. Hotel Savoy Opheans (HMV 5027, UK, 1927, aka Savoy Havana Band) 6. Merrit Brunies &amp; His Friar's Inn Orchestra on Okeh 40593, 3/2/26. An exhibit of early-twentieth-century postcards depicting &quot;Masculine Women and Feminine Men&quot; is available at: http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuals received a level of acceptance that was not seen again until the 1960s. Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as &quot;pansy clubs&quot;. The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star. '' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade included [[Alla Nazimova]] and [[Ramon Novarro]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star. '' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12–13, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.

===Late 1930s===
By 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and mores, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young [[Undercover Cops|undercover cops]] to get them to make propositions to them.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.

During [[The Holocaust]] about 50,000 people were sentenced because of their homosexuality and several thousands of them died in concentration camps. Outside of the gay community, this persecution of homosexuals is usually ignored (see [[History of Gays during the Holocaust]] for more information). Conditions for gay men in the camps was especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of beatings. German soldiers were also known to use the pink triangles that the men were forced to wear for [[target practice]] with their weapons. Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. &quot;anti-social&quot;.

By the 1930s both ''fruit'' and ''fruitcake'' terms as well as numerous other words are seen as not only negative but also to mean male homosexual,&lt;ref name=&quot;A Dictionary of Epithets&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunkling |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Dunkling|coauthor = |title=A Dictionary of Epithets and Terms of Address  |publisher=Routledge |date=1990, ISBN 0-415-00761-5|url = http://books.google.com/?id=5QIv39cbUMYC&amp;dq=fruit+homosexuality+term |accessdate=2007-11-15 |isbn=978-0-415-00761-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; although probably not universally.

===Stonewall Riots===
{{Main|Stonewall riots}}

In the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, Dick Leitsch, president of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and two other members staged the Sip-in at Julius bar on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens and butch dykes against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&amp;nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the Oscar Wilde Book Shop, which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.

===Decriminalization of Homosexuality (1961–2003)===
The first US state to decriminalize homosexuality was Illinois in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 123. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1969 that another state would follow (Connecticut), but the 1970s and 80s saw the decriminalization throughout the majority of the United States. The 14 states that did not repeal these laws until 2003 were forced to by the landmark United States Supreme Court case [[Lawrence v. Texas]].

===1980s===
In the 1980s a new intolerance and even hatred against them was manifested by society as it became more conservative, primarily with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). It is a common belief within the gay community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were vehemently anti-gay, but that is an extreme exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who “advocated” homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexual men. Robert G. Kaiser’s news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.
“The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,” Kaiser wrote. “Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans’ private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan’s 60th birthday party — a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan’s press secretary.”  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: The Gay Left Lies about Reagan — Again]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all conservatives were as tolerant. Many people called AIDS a &quot;punishment from God&quot; and blamed gay men for their &quot;loose morals.&quot; However by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gay men as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also despite the more conservative period life in general for gays and lesbians were considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era. Canards against LGBT people are still employed and in 2010 several Christian right organizations are upgraded from &quot;anti-gay&quot; to [[hate group]]s by the Southern Poverty Law Center which historically tracts hate activities due to the groups' propagation of known falsehoods about lesbians and gays.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/Religion-News/RNS-Hate-group-watchdog-adds-Family-Research-Council-to-its-list.aspx RNS: Hate group watchdog adds Family Research Council to its list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/11/24/hate Anti-gay group: We aren't hateful!: The Family Research Council is angry that its homophobic rhetoric has gotten it labeled a &quot;hate group&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9266:tolerance-group-accused-of-character-assassination&amp;catid=155:nonprofit-newswire&amp;Itemid=986 Tolerance Group Accused of Character Assassination]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite this, homosexuals in a [[Wall Street Journal]] survey in 1991 found in comparison with average Americans that they were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, and had average salaries $30,000 higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq &quot;The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom&quot;], Michael Bronski. Macmillan, 2000. ISBN 0-312-25287-0, ISBN 978-0-312-25287-8. p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage}}
{{World homosexuality laws map|align=right|size=350px}}

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, there has been a growing movement in a number of countries to regard marriage as a right which should be extended to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]. Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples unmarried in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.

The first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. At present, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in ten countries (see map on the right): the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), and [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010). In [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]], same-sex marriage is recognized in all states, but performed only in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]], where it became effective on March 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{sp icon}} {{cite web | author=Carlos Áviles Allende | publisher=El Universal | title=Ratifica corte, bodas gay, válidas en todo el país | date=August 10, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/700789.html | accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay marriage effective&quot;&gt;{{sp icon}} {{cite web | author=Mónica Archundia | publisher=El Universal | title=La primera unión gay, para marzo | date=January 5, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/99607.html | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States as of July 2011, the states of [[New York]], [[Vermont]], [[Iowa]], [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Massachusetts]] are the ones to recognize and offer same-sex marriages, while the states of [[New Jersey]], California, [[Nevada]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], as well as the [[District of Columbia]] offer same-sex partners benefits similar to those of legally married couples. Seventeen other States have constitutional provisions that limit marriages to one man and one woman, while 25 states have statutes containing similar definitions. In the United States, the debate over whether or not to make same-sex marriages legally binding remains one of the most polarizing and divisive political debates of the early 21st century, and it is discussed with great passion all over the world. During 2004, 13 [[U.S. state|US states]] amended their constitutions to define marriage as being only between one man and one woman. Some people, including many gay rights advocates and some heterosexual same-sex marriage advocates, view restrictions such as these as being an example of the [[tyranny of the majority]] in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spring fever |work=Bill and Kent's Place on the Web |url=http://billandkent.com/blog/archives/000802.htm |accessdate=November 8, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613211653/http://billandkent.com/blog/archives/000802.htm |archivedate = June 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Matt Daniels, president of the traditionalist Alliance for Marriage condemned the decision. |work=NewsFeed Researcher |url=http://newsfeedresearcher.com/rss/idn2006.10.29.11.58.50.jsp#hdng1 |accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student groups===
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}
{{Main|Gay-straight alliance}}

Since the mid-1970s students at high schools and universities have organized GBTL groups, often called Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) at their respective schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amsa.org/news/release2.cfx?id=279 American Medical Student Association. September 13, 2006: &quot;Nation's Medical Students Applaud California Osteopathic Medical School's Affirmation of [[Gay-straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliance]].&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The groups form to provide support for GBTL students and to promote awareness of GBTL issues in the local community. In 1990, a student group named [[The Other Ten Percentile]] (Hebrew: העשירון האחר) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first [[GBTL]] organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recogniztion as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, organizing these groups do not always work. For most places around the world it takes time for them to become recognized.

===Schools===
Several public schools have opened with a specific mission to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for LGBT students and allies, including [[Harvey Milk High School]] in New York City, and [[The Alliance School (Milwaukee)|The Alliance School]] of [[Milwaukee]]. The Social Justice High School-Pride Campus is proposed for Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95565768&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of private schools have also identified as &quot;gay friendly&quot;, such as the [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]] in New York City.

In 2012, for the first time, two American school districts celebrated [[LGBT History Month]]; the Broward County school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, and later that year the Los Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on. &lt;ref&gt;http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/two-school-districts-recognize-lgbt-month/?hpt=us_bn1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical study of homosexuality==

===19th century and early 20th century===
When Heinrich Hoessli and K. H. Ulrichs began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, ISBN 0-8153-3354-4, ISBN 978-0-8153-3354-8, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In German [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus_Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.

===1950s and 1960s===
As part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.

The atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''[[Annales (journal)|Annales]]''. Although several useful syntheses of the world history of homosexuality have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990, pp539-542&lt;/ref&gt;
