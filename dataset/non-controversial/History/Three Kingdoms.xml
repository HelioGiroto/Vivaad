{{History of China|BC=1}}
The '''Three Kingdoms period''' ({{zh|first=t|t={{linktext|三|國|時|代}}|s={{linktext|三|国|时|代}}|p=Sānguó shídài}}) was a period in [[History of China|Chinese history]], part of an [[period of disunity|era of disunity]] called the &quot;[[Six Dynasties]]&quot; following immediately the loss of [[de facto]] power of the [[Han Dynasty]] rulers. In a strict academic sense, it refers to the period between the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] in 220 AD and the [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquest]] of the state of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] by the [[Jìn Dynasty]] in 280. However, many Chinese historians extend the starting point of this period back to various years during the collapse of the Han dynasty, such as to the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Guo Jian (郭建) |title=千秋興亡 |trans_title=Rise and Fall over Thousands of Autumns|publisher= 長春出版社 (Changchun Press) |location=[[Changchun]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jiang Lang (姜狼) | title=184-280:三國原來這樣|trans_title=184-280: It Turns out the Three Kingdoms Were like This|location=[[Beijing]]|publisher=現代出版社 (Modern Press)|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the year after the beginning of the rebellion, 185;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Han Guopan (韓國磐)| title=魏晉南北朝史綱 |trans_title=Historical Highlights of the Six Dynasties|publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dong Zhuo]] deposing and murdering [[Emperor Shao of Han]] and establishing [[Emperor Xian of Han]] in 189;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Zhang Binsheng (張儐生) | title=魏晉南北朝政治史 |trans_title=Administrative History of the Six Dynasties| publisher=中國文化大學 (Chinese Culture University Press) | location=[[Taipei]] | year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國經濟通史 魏晉南北朝經濟卷| trans_title=The Complete Economic History of China: Economy of the Six Dynasties|editor=Gao Min (高敏) | publisher=經濟日報出版社 (Economics Daily Press) | location=[[Hong Kong]] | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Zhuo sacking [[Luoyang]] and moving the capital to [[Chang'an]] in 190;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國軍事通史 三國軍事史 | trans_title=The Complete Military History of China: Three Kingdoms Military History|author=Luo Kun (羅琨) et al. | publisher=軍事科學出版社 (Military Science Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Cao Cao]] placing the emperor under his control in [[Xuchang]] in 196.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=魏晉南北朝社會生活史 | trans_title=The Social History of the Six Dynasties|author=Zhu Dawei (朱大渭) et al. | publisher = 中國社會科學出版社 (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國魏晉南北朝軍事史 | trans_title=China's Six Dynasties Military History|author=Zhang Wenqiang (張文強) | publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press) | location=[[Beijing]] | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國風俗通史 魏晉南北朝卷 | trans_title=The Complete History of Chinese Customs: Six Dynasties|author1= Zhang Chengzong (張承宗) | author2= Wei Xiangdong (魏向東) | publisher=上海藝文出版社 (Shanghai People's Press) | location=[[Shanghai]] | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國魏晉南北朝政治史 （百卷本國全史第7）|trans_title=China's Six Dynasties Administrative History (This Nation's Total History in 100 Volumes, no 7)|author=He Dezhang (何德章)|publisher=人民出版社 (People's Press)|location=[[Beijing]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=中國農業通史 魏晉南北朝卷|trans_title=The Complete History of Chinese Agriculture: Six Dynasties|author=Wang Lihua (王利華) et al.|publisher=中國農業出版社 (Chinese Agricultural Press)|location=[[Beijing]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Three Kingdoms'' ({{zh|first=t|t=三國|s=三国|p=Sānguó}}) were [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (魏), [[Shu Han|Shu]] (蜀), and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] (吳). To further distinguish these states from other historical Chinese states of the same name, historians add a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei (曹魏), Shu is also known as Shu Han (蜀漢), and Wu is also known as Eastern Wu (東吳). The term &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by kings, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han Dynasty. Although the translation &quot;Three Empires&quot; is more contextually accurate,&lt;ref&gt;Chinaknowledge, [http://www.chinaknowledge.org/History/Division/sanguo.html Chinese History - Three Kingdoms]&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; has become standard among [[Sinology|sinologist]]s.

The earlier, &quot;unofficial&quot; part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China. The middle part of the period, from 220 and 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states, Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of this period was marked by the collapse of the tripartite situation: first the [[conquest of Shu by Wei]] (263), then the overthrow of Wei by the Jin Dynasty (265), and the destruction of Wu by Jin (280).

Although relatively short, this historical period has been greatly romanticised in the cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It has been celebrated and popularised in operas, folk stories, novels and in more recent times, films, television, and video games. The best known of these is [[Luo Guanzhong]]'s ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[Ming Dynasty]] historical novel based on events in the Three Kingdoms period. The authoritative historical record of the era is [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', along with [[Pei Songzhi]]'s later annotations of the text.

The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A population census during the late Eastern Han Dynasty reported a population of approximately 50 million, while a population census during the early Western Jin Dynasty reported a population of approximately 16 million.&lt;ref name = ANU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A history of China in the Third Century AD|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/asianstudies/decrespigny/3KWJin.html|last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe|publisher=Australian National University| month =November | year=2003|accessdate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Jin Dynasty's census was far less complete than the Han census, so these figures are in question.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Technology advanced significantly during this period. Shu [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Zhuge Liang]] invented the [[wooden ox]], suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the [[repeating crossbow]]. Wei mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor [[Zhang Heng]]. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for [[Cao Rui|Emperor Ming of Wei]], square-pallet [[chain pump]]s for irrigation of gardens in [[Luoyang]], and the ingenious design of the [[South Pointing Chariot]], a non-magnetic directional compass operated by [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.

==Periodisation==
There is no set time period for the era, and many arbitrary definitions are given. The strictest rule of dating would be to deem the era to be from the point where all three states coexisted as independent states (229, with the foundation of [[Eastern Wu]]) up until the downfall of the [[Shu-Han]] Kingdom (at which point, only two kingdoms continued to exist rather than three.) [[Mao Zonggang]], a commentator on the [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], mentions in his commentary on Chapter 120 of the novel that:

::''&quot;The three kingdoms formed when the Han royal house declined. The Han royal house declined when the eunuchs abused the sovereign and officials subverted the government.&quot;'').&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Three_kingdoms.html?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In doing so, he suggests that the historiography of the Three Kingdoms should begin at the rise of the [[Ten Eunuchs]] to power. He further argues that the Romance of the Three Kingdoms defines the end of the era as 280, the downfall of Wu, justifying:

::''&quot;As the novel focuses on Han, it could have ended with the fall of Han. But Wei usurped Han. To end the tale before Han's enemy had itself met its fate would be to leave the reader unsatisfied. The novel could have ended with the fall of Wei, but Han's ally was Wu. To end the tale before Han's ally had fallen would be to leave the reader with an incomplete picture. So the tale had to end with the fall of Wu.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Moss |last=Roberts | title=Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Three_kingdoms.html?id=Sc-shy_ZOMkC | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-520-22503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Chinese laymen {{Who?|date=June 2012}} extend the Three Kingdoms into the Later Han Dynasty, variably to 184 (to the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]) or to 189 (the Ten Eunuchs' coup).

By traditional Chinese historiography, no Three Kingdoms era officially existed, since in a legal sense the [[Mandate of Heaven]] was passed legitimately from the [[Emperor Xian|Han Emperor Xian]] to [[Cao Wei]], and then on to the [[Jìn Dynasty]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The power of the Eastern [[Han Dynasty]] went into depression and steadily declined after the reign of [[Emperor He of Han|Emperor He]] from a variety of political and economic problems. A series of Han emperors ascended the throne while still youths, and ''de facto'' imperial power often rested with the emperors' older relatives. As these relatives occasionally were loath to give up their influence, emperors would, upon reaching maturity, be forced to rely on political alliances with senior officials and [[eunuch]]s to achieve control of the government. Political posturing and infighting between imperial relatives and eunuch officials was a constant problem in Chinese government at the time. During the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] and [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], leading officials' dissatisfaction with the eunuchs' usurpations of power reached a peak, and many began to openly protest against them. The first and second protests met with failure, and the court eunuchs persuaded the emperor to execute many of the protesting scholars. Some local rulers seized the opportunity to exert despotic control over their lands and citizens, since many feared to speak out in the oppressive political climate. Emperors Huan and Ling's reigns were recorded as particularly dark periods of Han Dynasty rule. In addition to political oppression and mismanagement, China experienced a number of natural disasters during this period, and local rebellions sprung up throughout the country.

In the third month of 184, [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]], leader of the Way of Supreme Peace, a [[Taoism|Taoist]] movement, along with his two brothers [[Zhang Liang (Yellow Turban)|Zhang Liang]] and [[Zhang Bao (Yellow Turban)|Zhang Bao]], led the movement's followers in a rebellion against the government that was called the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]. Their movement quickly attracted followers and soon numbered several hundred thousands and received support from many parts of China. They had 36 bases throughout China, with large bases having 10,000 or more followers and minor bases having 6,000 to 7,000, similar to Han armies. Their motto was: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The [[firmament]]&lt;ref&gt;Referring to the Han Dynasty government&lt;/ref&gt; has perished, the Yellow Sky&lt;ref&gt;Referring to the Yellow Turban Rebellion&lt;/ref&gt; will soon rise; in this year of ''[[Chinese calendar|jiazi]]'', let there be prosperity in the world!&quot;&lt;br&gt;(蒼天已死，黃天當立。歲在甲子，天下大吉。)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Book of Han]]'' - ''Record of Emperor Xiaoling'' and the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' -''Guanghe Year 6'' record that Zhang Jiao declared himself Yellow Emperor and took their movement's name from a headscarf worn by followers [yellow signifying the Yellow Emperor and imperial authority].&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Ling dispatched generals [[Huangfu Song]], [[Lu Zhi (Han Dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], and [[Zhu Jun (Han Dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] to lead the Han armies against the rebels, and decreed that local governments had to supply soldiers to assist in their efforts. It is at this point that the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' begins its narrative. The Yellow Turbans were ultimately defeated and its surviving followers dispersed throughout China, but due to the turbulent situation throughout the empire, many were able to survive as bandits in mountainous areas, thus continuing their ability to contribute to the turmoil of the era.

With the widespread increase in bandits across the Chinese nation, the Han army had no way to repel each and every raiding party. In 188, Emperor Ling accepted a memorial from Yi Province&lt;ref&gt;Roughly covering the [[Sichuan Basin]]&lt;/ref&gt; governor [[Liu Yan (warlord)|Liu Yan]] suggesting he grant direct administrative power over feudal provinces and direct command of regional military to local governors, as well promoting them in rank and filling such positions with members of the Liu family or court officials.  This move made [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou'') official administrative units, and although they had power to combat rebellions, the later intra-government chaos allowed these local governors to easily rule independently of the central government. Soon after this move, Liu Yan severed all of his region's ties to the Han imperial court, and several other areas followed suit.

===Dong Zhuo in power===
In the same year, Emperor Ling died, and another struggle began between the court eunuchs for control of the imperial family. Court eunuch [[Jian Shuo]] planned to kill General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], a relative of the imperial family, and to replace the [[crown prince]] [[Prince of Hongnong|Liu Bian]] with his younger brother [[Emperor Xian of Han|Liu Xie]], the Prince of Chenliu (in present-day [[Kaifeng]]), though his plan was unsuccessful. Liu Bian took the Han throne as Emperor Shao, and He Jin plotted with warlord [[Yuan Shao]] to assassinate the [[Ten Attendants]], a clique of ten eunuchs led by [[Zhang Rang]] who controlled much of the imperial court. He Jin also ordered [[Dong Zhuo]], the frontier general in Liang Province, and [[Ding Yuan]], Inspector of Bing Province&lt;ref&gt;The area between present-day [[Baoding]] and [[Taiyuan]]&lt;/ref&gt;, to bring troops to the capital to reinforce his position of authority. The eunuchs learned of He Jin's plot, and had him assassinated before Dong Zhuo reached the capital [[Luoyang]]. When Yuan Shao's troops reached Luoyang, they stormed the palace complex, killing the Ten Attendants and 2,000 of the eunuchs' supporters. Though this move effectively ended the century-long feud between the eunuchs and the imperial family, it ushered in the era of warlords and martial law that became the Three Kingdoms era.

This event prompted the invitation of Dong Zhuo to enter Luoyang from the northwest boundary of China. At the time China faced the [[Qiang people|Qiang tribes]] in the northwest, and thus Dong Zhuo controlled a large army with elite training. When he brought the army to Luoyang, he was able to easily overpower the existing armies of both sides and took control of the imperial court, ushering in a period of civil war across China.

Dong Zhuo then manipulated the succession so that Liu Xie could take the throne in lieu of Liu Bian. Dong Zhuo, while ambitious, genuinely wished for a more capable emperor. On his way to Luoyang, he encountered a small band of soldiers protecting Liu Bian and Liu Xie fleeing the war zone. In the encounter Dong Zhuo acted arrogantly and threateningly, causing Liu Bian to be paralyzed with fear; Liu Xie, the future Emperor Xian, responded calmly with authority and commanded Dong Zhuo to protect the royal family with his army to return to the imperial court.

While Dong Zhuo originally wanted to re-establish the authority of the Han Dynasty and manage all the political conflict properly, his political capability proved to be much worse than his military leadership. His behaviour grew more and more violent and authoritarian, executing or sending into exile all that opposed him, and showed less and less respect to the emperor. He ignored all royal etiquette and frequently carried open weapons into the imperial court. In 190 [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|a coalition led by Yuan Shao]] was formed between nearly all the provincial authorities in the eastern provinces of the empire against Dong Zhuo. The mounting pressure from repeated defeat on the southern frontline against [[Sun Jian]]'s forces drove Emperor Xian and later Dong Zhuo himself west to [[Chang'an]] in May 191.

Dong Zhuo once again demonstrated his political shortcomings by forcing millions of residents of Luoyang to migrate to Chang'an. He then set fire to Luoyang, preventing occupation by his enemies and destroying the biggest city in China at that time. In addition, he ordered his army to slaughter a whole village of civilians. The soldiers beheaded the civilians and carried their heads into Chang'an to show off as war trophies, pretending to have had a great victory against his enemies. A year later Dong Zhuo was killed in a [[coup d'etat]] by [[Wang Yun]] and [[Lü Bu]].

=== Rise of Cao Cao ===
[[Image:Cao Cao scth.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A portrait of Cao Cao from ''Sancai Tuhui'']]

In 192, there was some talk among the coalition of appointing [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], an imperial relative, as emperor, and gradually its members began to fall out. Most of the warlords in the coalition, with a few exceptions, sought the increase of personal military power in the time of instability instead of seriously wishing to restore the Han Dynasty's authority. The Han empire was divided between a number of regional warlords. [[Yuan Shao]] occupied the northern area of [[Ye, China|Ye]] and extended his power, by taking over his superior [[Han Fu (warlord)|Han Fu]] with trickery and intimidation, north of the [[Yellow River]] against [[Gongsun Zan]], who held the northern frontier. [[Cao Cao]], directly to Yuan Shao's south, was engaged in a struggle against [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Liu Biao]], who occupied respectively the [[Huai River]] basin and middle [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] regions. Further south the young warlord [[Sun Ce]], taking over after the untimely death of [[Sun Jian]], was establishing his rule in the lower Yangtze, albeit as a subordinate of Yuan Shu. In the west, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] held Yi Province while [[Hanzhong]] and the northwest were controlled by a motley collection of smaller warlords such as [[Ma Teng]] of Liang Province, the original post of Dong Zhuo.

Dong Zhuo, confident in his success, was slain by his follower [[Lü Bu]] and minister [[Wang Yun]]. Lü Bu, in turn, was attacked by Dong Zhuo's subordinates: [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]], [[Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Ji]] and [[Fan Chou]]. Wang Yun and his whole family were executed. Lü Bu fled to [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]], a northern warlord, and remained with him for a time before briefly joining Yuan Shao, but it was clear that Lü Bu was far too independent to serve another.

In August 195, Emperor Xian fled the tyranny of Li Jue at Chang'an and made a year long hazardous journey east in search of supporters. By 196, when he was received by Cao Cao, most of the smaller contenders for power had either been absorbed by larger ones or destroyed. This was an extremely important move for Cao Cao following the suggestion from his primary advisor, [[Xun Yu]], commenting that by supporting the authentic emperor, Cao Cao would have the formal legal authority to control the other warlords and force them to comply in order to restore the Han Dynasty.

Cao Cao, whose zone of control was the precursor to the state of Cao Wei, had raised an army in the winter of 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled Yan Province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by [[Zhang Miao]] and [[Chen Gong]], who joined his cause to create his first sizable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 Yellow Turban rebels into his army as well as a number of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing Province. In 196 he established an imperial court at [[Xuchang]] and developed military agricultural colonies (''[[tuntian]]'') to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased to be able to work with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos. This was later said to be his second important policy for success.

In 194, Cao Cao went to war with [[Tao Qian (Han Dynasty)|Tao Qian]] of Xu Province, because Tao's subordinate Zhang Kai had murdered Cao Cao's father [[Cao Song]]. Tao Qian received the support of [[Liu Bei]] and Gongsun Zan, but even then it seemed as if Cao Cao's superior forces would overrun Xu Province entirely. However, Cao Cao received word that Lü Bu had seized Yan Province in his absence, and accordingly he retreated, putting a halt to hostilities with Tao Qian for the time being. Tao Qian died in the same year, leaving his province to Liu Bei. A year later, in 195, Cao Cao managed to drive Lü Bu out of Yan Province. Lü Bu fled to Xu Province and was received by Liu Bei, and an uneasy alliance began between the two.

In the south, Sun Ce, then an independent general under the service of Yuan Shu, defeated the warlords of Yang Province, including [[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], [[Wang Lang]], and [[Yan Baihu]]. In 197, Yuan Shu, who was at odds with Cao Cao, Yuan Shao, and Liu Bei, felt assured of victory with his subordinate's conquests, and thus declared himself emperor of the Cheng Dynasty. The move, however, was a strategic blunder, as it drew the ire of many warlords across the land, including Yuan Shu's own subordinate Sun Ce, who had advised Yuan Shu not to make such a move. Cao Cao issued orders to Sun Ce to attack Yuan Shu. Sun Ce complied, but first convinced Cao Cao to form a coalition against Yuan Shu, of which Liu Bei and Lü Bu were members. Attacked on all sides, Yuan Shu was defeated and fled into hiding.

Afterwards, Lü Bu betrayed Liu Bei and seized Xu Province, forming an alliance with Yuan Shu's remnant forces. Liu Bei, together with his followers [[Zhang Fei]] and [[Guan Yu]], fled to Cao Cao, who accepted him. Soon, preparations were made for an attack on Lü Bu, and the combined forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei invaded Xu Province. Lü Bu's men deserted him, Yuan Shu's forces never arrived as reinforcements, and he was bound by his own subordinates [[Song Xian]] and [[Wei Xu]] and executed on Cao Cao's order.

In 200, [[Dong Cheng (Han Dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.

After settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.

In 200, after winning a decisive battle against Liu Biao at Sha County and putting down the rebellions of [[Xu Gong (Han Dynasty)|Xu Gong]] and others, Sun Ce was struck by an arrow and fatally wounded. On his deathbed, he named his younger brother, [[Sun Quan]], as his heir.

Following months of planning, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Overcoming Yuan Shao's superior numbers, Cao Cao decisively defeated him by setting fire to his supplies, and in doing so crippled the northern army. Liu Bei fled to join Liu Biao in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], and many of Yuan Shao's forces were destroyed. In 202, Cao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death and the resulting division among his sons to advance north of the Yellow River. He [[Battle of Ye|captured]] [[Ye, China|Ye]] in 204 and occupied the provinces of Ji, Bing, Qing and You. By the end of 207, after [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain|a lightning campaign]] against the [[Wuhuan]] barbarians, Cao Cao had achieved undisputed dominance of the [[North China Plain]].

=== Battle of Red Cliffs ===
{{main|Battle of Red Cliffs}}
[[Image:Chibi.jpg|thumb|300px|One traditional site of Red Cliffs ({{zh|c=赤壁}}), whose actual location is a matter of intense debate]]

In 208, [[Cao Cao]] marched south with his army hoping to quickly unify the empire. [[Liu Biao]]'s son [[Liu Cong (Han Dynasty)|Liu Cong]] surrendered [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] and Cao was able to capture a sizable fleet at Jiangling. [[Sun Quan]], the successor to [[Sun Ce]] in the lower [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], continued to resist, however. His advisor [[Lu Su]] secured an alliance with [[Liu Bei]], himself a recent refugee from the north, and [[Zhou Yu]] was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran general who served the Sun family, [[Cheng Pu]]. Their combined armies of 50,000 met Cao Cao's fleet and 200,000-strong force at [[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]] that winter. After an initial skirmish, an attack beginning with a plan to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet was set in motion to lead to the decisive defeat of Cao Cao, forcing him to retreat in disarray back to the north. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, and provided the basis for the states of Shu and Wu.

After his return to the north, Cao Cao contented himself with absorbing the northwestern regions in 211 and consolidating his power. He progressively increased his titles and power, eventually becoming the [[Chinese nobility|King]] of Wei in 217, a title bestowed upon him by the puppet Emperor Xian that he controlled. Liu Bei, having defeated the weak Jing Province warlords [[Han Xuan]], [[Jin Xuan]], [[Zhao Fan]], and [[Liu Du]], entered Yi Province and later in 214 displaced [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] as ruler, leaving [[Guan Yu]] in charge of Jing Province. Sun Quan, who had in the intervening years being engaged with defenses against Cao Cao in the southeast at [[Hefei]], now turned his attention to Jing Province and the middle Yangtze. Tensions between the allies were increasingly visible. In 219, after Liu Bei successfully seized [[Hanzhong]] from Cao Cao and as Guan Yu was engaged in the [[Battle of Fancheng|siege of Fancheng]], Sun Quan's general [[Lü Meng]] seized Jing Province in a [[Lü Meng's invasion of Jing Province|surprise invasion]]. Guan Yu was captured and executed on Sun Quan's order.

=== Emergence of the Three Kingdoms ===
In the first month of 220, [[Cao Cao]] died and in the tenth month his son [[Cao Pi]] forced [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] to abdicate, thus ending the [[Han Dynasty]]. He named his state [[Cao Wei|Wei]] and proclaimed himself emperor in [[Luoyang]]. In 221, [[Liu Bei]] declared himself emperor, in a bid to restore the fallen Han Dynasty. (His state is known in history as &quot;Shu&quot; or &quot;[[Shu Han]]&quot;) In the same year, Wei bestowed on [[Sun Quan]] the title of King of Wu. A year later, Shu declared war on Wu (this was because Wu had allied with Wei in order to defeat the sworn brother of Liu Bei - Guan Yu - who at that time placed in charge on [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], as it was most strategic location in all of the three kingdoms) and met the Wu armies at the [[Battle of Xiaoting]] (also known as Battle of Yiling). At Xiaoting, Liu Bei was disastrously defeated by Sun Quan's commander [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] and forced to retreat back to Shu, where he died soon afterward. After the death of Liu Bei, Shu and Wu resumed friendly relations at the expense of Wei, thus stabilizing the tripartite configuration. In 222, Sun Quan renounced his recognition of Cao Pi's regime and, in 229, he declared himself emperor of [[Eastern Wu]] in Wuchang.

Dominion of the north completely belonged to Wei, whilst Shu occupied the southwest and Wu the central south and east. The external borders of the states were generally limited to the extent of Chinese civilization. For example, the political control of Shu on its southern frontier was limited by the tribes of present-day [[Yunnan]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]], known collectively as the &quot;[[Nanman]]&quot; (southern barbarians).

=== Consolidation ===
{{See also|Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign}}

In 223, [[Liu Shan]] rose to the throne of [[Shu Han|Shu]] following his father's defeat and death. The defeat of [[Liu Bei]] at [[Battle of Xiaoting|Xiaoting]] ended the period of hostility between Wu and Shu and both used the opportunity to concentrate on internal problems and the external enemy of [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. For [[Sun Quan]], the victory terminated his fears of Shu expansion into [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] and he turned to the aborigines of the southeast, whom the Chinese collectively called the &quot;[[Baiyue|Shanyue]]&quot;. A collection of successes against the rebellious tribesmen culminated in the victory of 224. In that year [[Zhuge Ke]] ended a three year siege of Danyang with the surrender of 100,000 Shanyue. Of these, 40,000 were drafted as auxiliaries into the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] army. Meanwhile Shu was also experiencing troubles with the indigenous tribes of their south. The southwestern [[Nanman]] peoples rose in revolt against Shu authority, captured and looted cities in Yi Province. Zhuge Liang, recognising the importance of stability in the south, ordered the advance of the Shu armies in three columns against the Nanman. He fought a number of engagements against the chieftain [[Meng Huo]], at the end of which Meng Huo submitted. A tribesman was allowed to reside at the Shu capital [[Chengdu]] as an official and the Nanman formed their own battalions within the Shu army.

=== Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions ===
{{Main|Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions}}
At the end of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s Southern Campaign, the Wu-Shu alliance came to fruition and Shu was free to move against the north. In 227, Zhuge Liang transferred his main Shu armies to [[Hanzhong]], and opened up the battle for the northwest with Wei. The next year, he ordered [[Zhao Yun]] to attack from Ji Gorge as a diversion while Zhuge himself led the main force to Mount Qi. The vanguard [[Ma Su]], however, suffered a tactical defeat at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]] and the Shu army was forced to withdraw. In the next six years Zhuge Liang attempted several more offensives, but supply problems limited the capacity for success. In 234 he led his last great northern offensive, reaching the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] south of the [[Wei River]]. Due to the death of Zhuge Liang (234), however, the Shu army was forced once again to withdraw, but were pursued by Wei. The Shu forces began to withdraw; [[Sima Yi]] deduced Zhuge Liang's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.

=== Wu and the South ===
In the times of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s northern offensives, the state of Wu had always been on the defensive against invasions from the north. The area around [[Hefei]] was the scene of many bitter battles and under constant pressure from Wei after the Battle of Red Cliffs. Warfare had grown so intense that many of the residents chose to migrate and resettle south of the [[Yangtze River]]. After Zhuge Liang's death, attacks on the southern [[Huai River]] region intensified but nonetheless, Wei could not break through the line of the river defenses erected by Wu, which included the Ruxu fortress.

[[Sun Quan]]'s long reign is regarded as a time of plenty for his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangtze and in Kuaiji commandery (present-day [[Shaoxing]]). River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of [[celadon]] and metal industries. Ocean transport was improved to such an extent that sea journeys were made to [[Manchuria]] and the island of [[Taiwan]]. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (Southern [[Vietnam]]) and [[Funan Kingdom]]. As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangtze delta, the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influences reached the south from [[Luoyang]].

==Decline and end of the Three Kingdoms==
[[Image:China 5.jpg|250px|thumb|The Three Kingdoms in 262, on the eve of the conquest of Shu.]]
From the late 230s, tensions began to become visible between the imperial Cao clan and the Sima clan. Following the death of [[Cao Zhen]], factionalism was evident between [[Cao Shuang]] and the Grand Tutor [[Sima Yi]]. In deliberations, Cao Shuang placed his own supporters in important posts and excluded Sima Yi, whom he regarded as a dangerous threat. The power of the Sima clan, one of the great landowning families of the Han Dynasty, was bolstered by Sima Yi's military victories. Additionally, Sima Yi was an extremely capable strategist and politician. In 238 he [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|crushed the rebellion]] of [[Gongsun Yuan]] and brought the [[Liaodong]] region directly under central control. Ultimately, he outmaneuvered Cao Shuang in power play. Taking advantage of an excursion by the imperial clansmen to the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|Gaoping Tombs]], Sima Yi undertook a [[putsch]] in Luoyang, forcing Cao Shuang's faction from authority. Many protested against the overwhelming power of the Sima family; notable among these were the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]. One of the sages, [[Xi Kang]], was executed as part of the purges after Cao Shuang's downfall.

===Fall of Shu===
{{Main|Conquest of Shu by Wei}}
The decreasing strength of the Cao clan was mirrored by the decline of Shu. After [[Zhuge Liang]]'s death, his position as [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] fell to [[Jiang Wan]], [[Fei Yi]] and [[Dong Yun]], in that order. But after 258, Shu politics became increasingly controlled by the [[eunuch]] faction and corruption rose. Despite the energetic efforts of [[Jiang Wei]], Zhuge Liang's [[protege]], Shu was unable to secure any decisive achievement. In 263, Wei launched a three-pronged attack and the Shu army was forced into general retreat from Hanzhong. Jiang Wei hurriedly held a position at Jiange but he was outflanked by the Wei commander [[Deng Ai]], who force-marched his army from Yinping through territory formerly considered impassable. By the winter of the year, the capital [[Chengdu]] fell due to the strategic invasion of Wei by Deng Ai who invaded Chengdu personally. The emperor [[Liu Shan]] thus surrendered. The state of Shu had come to an end after 43 years. Liu Shan was reinstated to the Wei capital of Luoyang and was given the new title of the &quot;Duke of Anle&quot;.  Directly translated, it meant the &quot;Duke of Safety and Happiness&quot; and was a trivial position with no actual power.

===Fall of Wei===
[[Cao Huan]] succeeded to the throne in 260 after [[Cao Mao]] was killed in a failed coup against [[Sima Zhao]]. Soon after, Sima Zhao died and his title as Duke of Jìn was inherited by his son [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]]. Sima Yan immediately began plotting to become emperor but faced stiff opposition. However, due to advice from his advisors, Cao Huan decided the best course of action would be to abdicate, unlike his predecessor Cao Mao. Sima Yan seized the throne in 264 after forcing Cao Huan's abdication, effectively overthrowing the Wei Dynasty and establishing the successor [[Jìn Dynasty]]. This situation was similar to the deposal of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] by [[Cao Pi]] 40 years earlier.

===Fall of Wu===
{{Main|Conquest of Wu by Jin}}

Following [[Sun Quan]]'s death and the ascension of the young [[Sun Liang]] to the throne in 252, the state of Wu went into a period of steady decline. Successful Wei suppression of rebellions in the southern [[Huai River]] region by [[Sima Zhao]] and [[Sima Shi]] reduced any opportunity of Wu influence. The fall of Shu signalled a change in Wei politics. After Liu Shan surrendered to Wei, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] (grandson of Sima Yi), overthrew the Wei emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty of Jin in 264, ending 46 years of Cao dominion in the north. After Jin's rise, emperor [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]] of Wu died, and his ministers gave the throne to [[Sun Hao]]. Sun Hao was a promising young man, but upon ascension he became a tyrant, killing or exiling all who dared oppose him in the court. In 269 [[Yang Hu]], a Jin commander in the south, started preparing for the invasion of Wu by ordering the construction of a fleet and the training of marines in [[Sichuan]] under [[Wang Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Wang Jun]]. Four years later, [[Lu Kang]], the last great general of Wu, died leaving no competent successor. The planned Jin offensive finally came in the winter of 279. Sima Yan launched five simultaneous offensives along the [[Yangtze River]] from Jianye (present-day [[Nanjing]]) to Jiangling whilst the Sichuan fleet sailed downriver to [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. Under the strain of such an enormous attack, the Wu forces collapsed and Jianye fell in the third month of 280. Sun Hao surrendered and was given a fiefdom on which to live out his days. This marked the end of the Three Kingdoms era, and the beginning of a break in the forthcoming 300 years of chaos.

== Population ==
After the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], serious famine followed in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]]s of China. After his coming to power, [[Dong Zhuo]] gave full swing to his army to plunder and rape women. When the Guandong Coalition was starting the campaign against Dong Zhuo, unexpectedly absurd enough, he ordered that &quot;all the population of [[Luoyang]] be forced to move to [[Chang'an]], all the palaces, temples, official residences and homes be burnt, no one should stay within that area of 200 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''&quot;, (considering the miserable life at that time, it was almost impossible for most people to move to the final destination alive) thus making cries of discontent rise all round and the population there decreased sharply. When Cao Cao was attacking Xu Province, it was said that &quot;hundreds of thousands of men and women were buried alive, even dogs and chickens did not survive. The [[Si River]] was blocked. From then on, these five towns never recover.&quot;  When [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] and his army were advancing towards the [[Guanzhong]] area, &quot;there remained hundreds of thousands of people, but Li Jue allowed his army to plunder the cities and the people, thus making the people have nothing but eat each other to death.&quot;  

It can be known from the following table that how serious the decrease of population was during that period. From the late Eastern Han to the Western Jin Dynasty, despite its length about 125 years, the peak number of population only equaled 35.3% of the peak number of the entire Eastern Han Dynasty. From then on to [[Sui Dynasty]], the population never recovered. It also should be noted that the high militarization of the population was common. For example, the population of Shu was 900,000, but the military were more than 100,000, occupying more than 10% of the population. The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' contains population figures for the Three Kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.

While it is clear that warfare undoubtedly took many lives during this period, the census figures do not support the idea that millions were wiped out solely from warfare. Other factors such as mass migration out of China must be taken into account.

== Economy ==
In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, due to natural disasters and social unrest, the economy was badly depressed, leading to the massive waste of farmland. Some local landlords and aristocracy established their own strongholds to defend themselves and developed agriculture, which gradually evolved into a self-sufficient manorial system. The system of strongholds and manors also had effects on the economical mode of following dynasties. In addition, because of the collapse of the imperial court, those worn copper coins were not melted and reminted and many privately minted coins appeared. In the Three Kingdoms period, newly minted coins never made their way into currency. Due to the collapse of the coinage, Cao Wei officially declared silk cloth and grains as the main currencies in 221.&lt;ref name=ANU /&gt;

In economic terms the division of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern [[Song Dynasty]], 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and [[Sichuan]]). These geographical divisions are underscored by the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linking north and south, the hauling-way through the [[Three Gorges]] of the [[Yangtze River]] linking southern China with Sichuan and the [[gallery road]]s joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of [[Zhuge Liang]] (see [[Longzhong Plan]]).

==In popular culture==
{{See|Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Cultural_references}}
Numerous people and affairs from the period later became Chinese legends. The most complete and influential example is the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', written by [[Luo Guanzhong]] during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Possibly due to the popularity of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', the Three Kingdoms era is one of the most well known non-modern Chinese eras in terms of iconic characters, deeds and exploits. This is reflected in the way how fictional accounts of the Three Kingdoms, mostly based on the novel, play a significant role in East Asian popular culture. Books, television dramas, films, cartoons, anime, games, and music on the topic are still regularly produced in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam and Japan.
