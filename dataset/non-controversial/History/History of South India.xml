      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41728">{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
The history of the southern part of India covers a span of over four thousand years during which the region saw the rise and fall of a number of dynasties and empires. The period of known history of the region begins with the [[Iron age]] (1200 BC to 24 BC) period during which [[Chera dynasty|Chera]],  [[Chola]], [[Pandya]] ruled the South Indian country until 14th century A.D. Inscriptions on Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple shows that once Pandyan kingdom ruled from Himalayas in North to Kanyakumari in the South. Other dynasties of [[Satavahana]], [[Chalukya]], [[Pallava]], [[Rashtrakuta]],  [[Kakatiya]] and [[Hoysala]] were at their peak during various periods of history. These kingdoms constantly fought amongst each other and against external forces when Muslim armies invaded south India. [[Vijayanagara empire]] rose in response to the Muslim intervention and covered the most of south India and acted as a bulwark against [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] expansion into the south. When the European powers arrived during the 16th century CE, the southern kingdoms were not powerful enough to resist the new threat and eventually succumbed to British occupation. The British created the [[Madras Presidency]] which covered most of south India directly administered by the [[British Raj]], and divided the rest into a number of dependent princely states. After [[Indian independence]] South India was linguistically divided into the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].

==Prehistory==
{{See also|Prehistoric India|Prehistoric_Tamil_Nadu#Pre-historic_period|History_of_Karnataka#Pre-history|History_of_Andhra_Pradesh#Introduction|Pre-history of Kerala}}
South India remains is in the [[Mesolithic]] until 2500 BC. [[Microlith]] production is attested for the period 6000 to 3000 BC. The [[Neolithic]] period lasts from 2500 BC to 1000 BC, followed by the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]], characterized by [[megalithic]] burials.&lt;ref&gt;One such was found at [[Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri|Krishnagiri]] in Tamil Nadu—{{cite news | title= Steps to preserve megalithic burial site   | work= The Hindu, Oct 6, 2006 | url= http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/06/stories/2006100617521000.htm | publisher= The Hindu Group  | accessdate=2006-11-15 | location=Chennai, India | date=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Thirunelveli district and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. N. Sastri, ''A History of South India'', pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Early epigraphic evidence begins to appear from about the 5th century BC, in the form of [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscriptions, reflecting the southward spread of [[Buddhism]].

==Ancient history==
{{Main|Ancient history of South India}}
{{Further|Tamil Sangams|Sangam literature}}
Evidence in the forms of documents and inscriptions do not appear often in the history of ancient South India. Although there are signs that the history dates back to several centuries BCE, we only have any authentic archeological evidence from the early centuries of the [[common era]]. The Kingdom of Pratipalapura (5th century BCE), identified with [[Bhattiprolu]], in [[Guntur]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]] appears to be the earliest known kingdom in South India. We also have an inscriptional evidence to show that king Kubera was ruling over [[Bhattiprolu]] around 230 BC followed by Sala Kings. The script of [[Bhattiprolu]] inscriptions was the progentor of [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] Lipi that diversified later into modern [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] scripts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

During the reign of [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) the three [[Tamil language|Tamil]] dynasties of [[Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] and [[Pandya]] were running in the south, probably with late megalithic phase material culture. These areas (known as [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]]- &quot;Land of Tamils&quot;), while not part of Ashoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the [[Maurya Empire]].

===Pandyas===
{{Main|Pandyan Empire}}
The [[Pandyas]] were one of the three ancient Tamil dynasties ([[Chola]] and [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] being the other two) who ruled the Tamil country from pre-historic times until end of the 15th century. They ruled initially from Korkai, a sea port on the southern most tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to [[Madurai]]. Pandyas are mentioned in [[Sangam Literature]] (c. 100 – 200 CE) as well as by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sources during this period.

The early Pandyan dynasty of the Sangam literature went into obscurity during the invasion of the [[Kalabhras]]. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early 6th century, pushed the Kalabhras out of the Tamil country and ruled from Madurai. They again went into decline with the rise of the Cholas in the 9th century and were in constant conflict with them. Pandyas allied themselves with the Sinhalese and the Keralas in harassing the Chola empire until they found an opportunity for reviving their fortunes during the late 13th century. Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan (c. 1251) expanded their empire in to the Telugu country and invaded Sri Lanka to conquer the northern half of the island. They also had extensive trade links with the Southeast Asian maritime empires of [[Srivijaya]] and their successors. During their history Pandyas were repeatedly in conflict with the [[Pallavas]], [[Cholas]], [[Hoysalas]] and finally the Muslim invaders from the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The Pandyan Kingdom finally became extinct after the establishment of the Madurai Sultanate in the 14th century. The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south Indian coast, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced one of the finest pearls known in the ancient world.

===Cholas===
{{Main|Chola Empire}}
{{See also|Early Cholas|Medieval Cholas|Later Cholas}}
[[Image:ThanjavurBigTemple.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Brihadeeswarar temple]] at [[Thanjavur]] is one of the largest monolithic temple complexes in the world - a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]
The [[Cholas]] were one the three main dynasties to rule south India from ancient times. [[Karikala Chola]] was the famous king during the early centuries of the common era and managed to gain ascendency over the [[Pandyas]] and [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]]. The Chola dynasty however went into a period of decline from c. fourth century CE. This period coincided with the ascendency of [[Kalabhras]] who moved down from the northern Tamil country displacing the established kingdoms and ruled over most of south India for almost 300 years.

[[Vijayalaya Chola]] revived the Chola dynasty in 850 CE by conquering [[Thanjavur]] and made it his capital. His son [[Aditya I]] defeated the Pallava king Aparajita and extended the Chola territories to Tondaimandalam. The centers of the Chola Kingdom were at [[Kanchi]] ([[Kanchipuram]]) and Thanjavur. One of the most powerful rulers of the Chola kingdom was [[Raja Raja Chola]].  He ruled from 985 to 1014 CE. His army conquered the Navy of the Cheras at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], and annexed [[Anuradhapura]] and the northern province of [[Ceylon]]. [[Rajendra Chola I]] completed the conquest of [[Sri Lanka]], invaded [[Bengal]], and undertook a great naval campaign that occupied parts of [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Burma]], and [[Sumatra]]. The Chola dynasty began declining by the 13th century and ended in 1279. Cholas were great builders and have left some of the most beautiful examples of early Dravidian temple architecture. [[Brihadisvara Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] is a fine example and has been listed as one of the [[United Nations]]' World Heritage sites.

===Cheras===
{{Main|Chera Empire|Chera kingdom}}
The [[Chera Empire|Chera kingdom]] were one of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] dynasties who ruled the southern India from ancient times until around the twelfth century CE. The Early Cheras ruled over the [[Malabar Coast]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Erode]], [[Namakkal]], [[Karur]] and [[Salem District|Salem]] Districts in South India, which now forms part of the modern day Indian states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Throughout the reign of the Early Cheras, trade continued to bring prosperity to their territories, with spices, ivory, timber, pearls and gems being exported to the [[Middle East]] and to [[southern Europe]]. Evidence of extensive foreign trade from ancient times can be seen throughout the Malabar coast ([[Muziris]]), Karur and Coimbatore districts.

===Satavahanas===
{{Main|Satavahanas}}

|}
The '''Sâtavâhana Empire''' started out as feudatories to the [[Mauryan Empire]] but declared independence soon after the death of [[Ashoka]] (232&amp;nbsp;BC). They were the first Indic rulers to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed and are known for their patronage of [[Buddhism]] resulting in Buddhist monuments from [[Ellora]] to [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]]. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Gangetic plains to the southern tip of India.

The [[Satavahana]]s had to compete with the [[Sunga]] and the [[Kanva dynasty]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]] to establish first their independence then to expand their rule. Later they had to contend in protecting their domain from the incursions of  [[Sakas]], [[Yavanas]] and [[Pahlavas]]. In particular their struggles with the [[Western Kshatrapas]] weakened them and the kingdom split into smaller states

===Pallavas===
{{Main|Pallava Empire}}
[[Image:Mamallapuram1a.jpg|thumb|The [[Shore Temple]] in [[Mahabalipuram]] built by the Pallavas - a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]
The [[Pallava]]s were a great south Indian dynasty who ruled between the third century CE until their final decline in the ninth century CE. Their capital was [[Kanchipuram]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Their [[Origin of Pallava|origins]] are not clearly known. However, it is surmised that they were yadavas and they probably were feudatories of [[Satavahanas]]. [[Pallava]]s started their rule from [[Krishna river]] valley, known today as [[Palnadu]], and subsequently spread to southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] and north [[Tamil Nadu]]. [[Mahendravarman I]] was a prominent Pallava king who began work on the rock-cut temples of [[Mahabalipuram]]. His son [[Narasimhavarman I]] came to throne in 630 CE. He defeated the Chalukya king [[Pulakesi II]] in 632 CE and burned the Chalukyan capital Vatapi. Pallavas and [[Pandyas]] dominmated the souther regions of South India between the sixth and the ninth centuries CE.

===Kadambas of Banavasi===
{{Main|Kadambas}}
[[Image:Kambadahalli Jain temple.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Panchakuta Basadi, 9th. cen. [[Jain]], [[Kambadahalli]], [[Mandya District]], Karnataka]]
[[Kadambas]] ruled during 345–525 CE. Their kingdom spanned the present day [[Karnataka]] state. [[Banavasi]] was their capital. They expanded their territories to cover [[Goa]], [[Hanagal]]. The dynasty was founded by Mayura Sharma c. 345 CE. They built fine temples in Banavasi, [[Belgaum]], [[Halsi]] and Goa. Kadambas were the first rulers to use [[Kannada]] as an administrative language as proven by the [[Halmidi inscription]] (450 CE) and Banavasi copper coin. With the rise of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] of Badami, the Kadambas ruled as their feudatory from 525 CE for another five hundred years.

===Gangas of Talkad===
{{Main|Western Gangas}}
The [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] ruled southern Karnataka region during 350–550 CE. They continued to rule until the 10th century as feudatories of [[Rashtrakutas]] and [[Chalukyas]]. They rose from the region after the fall of the Satavahana empire and created a kingdom for themselves in Gangavadi (south Karnataka) while the Kadambas, their contemporaries, did the same in north Karnataka. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi which included the present day districts of [[Mysore]], [[Chamrajanagar]], [[Tumkur]], [[Kolar]], [[Mandya]] and [[Bangalore]]. They continued to rule until the 10th century as feudatories of [[Rashtrakutas]] and [[Chalukyas]]. Gangas initially had their capital at [[Kolar]], before moving it to [[Talakad]] near Mysore. They made a significant contribution to Kannada literature with such noted writers as King [[Durvinita]], King [[Shivamara II]] and [[Chavundaraya]]. The famous [[Jain]] monuments at [[Shravanabelagola]] were built by them.

===Chalukyas of Badami===
{{Main|Chalukya Empire}}
[[Image:Pattadakal1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Badami Chalukya Architecture]], [[Virupaksha Temple]], [[Badami]], [[Karnataka]].]]
One of the first kings of the [[Chalukyas|Chalukyan]] dynasty was [[Pulakesi I]].  He ruled from [[Badami]], the present day [[Bijapur, Karnataka]], in [[Karnataka]]. His son [[Pulakesi II]] became the king of the Chalukyan empire in 610&amp;nbsp;CE and ruled until 642 CE. Pulakesi II is most remembered for the battle he fought and won against Emperor [[Harshavardhana]] in 637 CE. He also defeated the Pallava king  [[Mahendravarman I]]. The Chalukya empire existed from 543–757 CE and an area stretching from Kaveri to Narmada rivers. The [[Chalukyas]] created the Chalukyan style of architecture. Great monuments were built in [[Pattadakal]], [[Aihole]] and [[Badami]]. These temples exhibit evolution of the [[Vesara]] style of architecture.

The Chalukyas of [[Vengi]], also known as the [[Eastern Chalukyas]], who were related to the Badami Chalukyas ruled along the east coast of South India around the present-day [[Vijayawada]]. The Eastern Chalukya dynasty was created by [[Kubja Vishnuvardhana]], a brother of [[Pulakesi II]]. The Eastern Chalukyas continued to rule for over five hundred years and were in close alliance with the [[Cholas]].

===Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta===
{{Main|Rashtrakuta Empire}}
[[Image:Kailasha temple at ellora.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rashtrakuta architecture, Kailasanatha Temple, in [[Ellora Caves]], [[Maharashtra]].]]
The [[Rashtrakuta]] Empire ruled from Manyaketha in [[Gulbarga]] from 735 CE until 982 CE and reached its peak under [[Amoghavarsha I]] (814–878 CE), considered ''Ashoka of South India''. The Rashtrakutas came to power at the decline of the Badami Chalukyas and were involved in a three-way power struggle for control of the Gangetic plains with the [[Prathihara]] of [[Gujarat]] and [[Pala Empire|Palas]] of [[Bengal]]. The Rashtrakutas were responsible for building some of the beautiful rock-cut temples of [[Ellora]] including the Kailasa temple. [[Kannada language]] literature flourished during this period of [[Adikavi Pampa]], [[Sri Ponna]] and [[Shivakotiacharya]]. King [[Amoghavarsha I]] wrote the earliest [[Extant literature|extant]] Kannada classic [[Kavirajamarga]].

===Chalukyas of Kalyani ( Eastern Chalukyas )===
{{Main|Western Chalukya Empire}}
&lt;!--[[Image:Tripurantakesvara Temple Open Mantapa1 at Balligavi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mantapa, Kalyani Chalukya architecture, Thripuranthakeshwara Temple (1070 CE), [[Shimoga]], Karnataka]]--&gt;
[[Image:Itagi Mahadeva temple.JPG|thumb|left|Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the [[Koppal district]], 1112 CE, an example of ''dravida'' articulation with a ''nagara'' superstructure]]
The [[Western Chalukya Empire]] was created by the descendants of the Badami Chalukya clan and ruled from 973–1195 CE. Their capital was [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]], present day [[Basava Kalyana]] in [[Karnataka]]. They came to power at the decline of the [[Rashtrakutas]]. They ruled from the Kaveri in the South to Gujarath in the north. The empire reached its peak under [[Vikramaditya VI]]. The [[Eastern Chalukyas|Kalyani Chalukyas]] promoted the ''[[Gadag]]'' style of architecture, excellent examples of which are present in [[Gadag]], [[Dharwad]], [[Koppal]] and [[Haveri]] districts of Karnataka. They patronised great Kannada poets such as [[Ranna]] and [[Nagavarma II]] and is considered as a golden age of [[Kannada literature]]. The [[Vachana]] ''Sahitya'' style of native Kannada poetry flourished during these times.

===Hoysalas===
{{Main|Hoysala Empire}}
[[Image:Somanathapura Keshava temple altered.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Keshava temple]], [[Somanathapura]], [[Karnataka]].]]
[[Hoysalas]] began their rule as subordinates of the Chalukyas of Kalyani and gradually established their own empire. Nripa Kama Hoysala who ruled in the western region of Gangavadi, founded the [[Hoysala]] dynasty. His later successor Ballala I reigned from his capital at [[Belur]]. [[Vishnuvardhana]] Hoysala (1106–1152 CE) conquered the [[Nolamba]] region earning the title ''Nolambavadi Gonda''. Some of the most magnificent specimens of South Indian temples are those attributed to the Hoysala dynasty of Karnataka. [[Vesara]] style reached its peak in their period. Hoysalas period is remembered today as one of the brightest periods in the history of Karnataka. They ruled [[Karnataka]] for over three centuries from c. 1000 to 1342 CE. The most famous kings among the Hoysalas were [[Vishnuvardhana]], [[Veera Ballala II]] and [[Veera Ballala III]]. Jainism flourished during the Hoysala period. Ramanuja the founder of Shri Vaishnavism, came to Hoysala kingdom to spread his religion. Hoysalas encouraged both Kannada and [[Sanskrit literature]] and earned a great name as builders of temples at [[Belur]], [[Halebid]]u, [[Somanathapura]], [[Belavadi]] and [[Amrithapura]]. Such famous poets as [[Rudrabhatta]], [[Janna]], [[Raghavanka]] and [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] wrote many classics in Kannada during this time.

===Kakatiyas===
{{Main|Kakatiyas}}
[[Image:Ramappa1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramappa temple]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
The [[Kakatiya dynasty]] rose to prominence in the eleventh century with the decline of the [[Chalukyas]].  By the early 12th century, the Kakatiya Durjaya clan declared independence and began expanding their kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://igmlnet.uohyd.ernet.in:8000/gw_44_5/hi-res/hcu_images/G2.pdf The History of Andhras, Durga Prasad]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the century, their kingdom had reached the [[Bay of Bengal]] and it stretched between the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and the [[Krishna]] rivers. The empire reached its zenith under Ganapatideva who was its greatest ruler. At its largest, the empire included most of modern day [[Andhra Pradesh]] and parts of [[Orissa]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Chattisgarh]] and [[Karnataka]]. Ganapatideva was succeeded by his daughter Rudramamba. The Kakatiya dynasty lasted for three centuries. [[Warangal]] was their capital. By the early 14th century, the Kakatiya dynasty attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate under Allauddin Khilji. It paid tribute to Delhi for a few years, but was eventually conquered by the forces of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] in 1323.

===Musunuri===
{{Main|Musunuri Nayaks}}
After the downfall of [[Kakatiya]] empire, two cousins known as [[Musunuri Nayaks]] rebelled against [[Delhi Sultanate]] and recaptured [[Warangal]] and brought the whole of [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking areas under their control. Although short lived (50 years), the Nayak rule is considered a watershed in the history of South India. Their rule inspired the establishment of [[Vijayanagar empire]] to defend [[Hindu]]  dharma for the next five centuries.

==Medieval history==

===Rise of Islamic Forces===
[[Image:Hampi8.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Vijayanagara]] architecture, Stone chariot in Vittala temple, Hampi, Karnataka]]
The early medieval period saw the rise of Muslim jihad in South India. The defeat of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] of [[Warangal]] by the forces of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1323 CE. and the defeat of the [[Hoysalas]] in 1333 CE. heralded a new chapter in South Indian history. The grand struggle of the period was between the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] based in [[Gulbarga]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] with its capital in Vijayanagara in modern [[Hampi]]. By the early sixteenth century, the Bahmani empire fragmented into five different kingdoms based in [[Ahmednagar]], [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]], [[Bidar]], [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Golconda]], together called the [[Deccan Sultanates]].

Whereas on the South-Western Coast of South India, a new local economical and political power arose into the vacuum created by the disintegration of [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] power. The [[Zamorin]]s of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], with the help of the Muslim-Arab merchants, dominated the maritime trade on Malabar Coast for the next few centuries.

===Vijayanagara Empire===
{{Main|Vijayanagara Empire|Origin of Vijayanagara Empire|Ancient City of Vijayanagara|Battle of Raichur|Battle of Talikota}}

Differing theories have been proposed regarding the Vijayanagara empire's origins. Many historians propose [[Harihara I]] and [[Bukka Raya I]], the founders of the empire, were [[Kannadiga]]s and commanders in the army of the [[Hoysala Empire]] stationed in the [[Tungabhadra]] region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kannadaempire&quot;&gt;Historians such as [[P. B. Desai]] (''History of Vijayanagar Empire'', 1936), [[Henry Heras]] (''The Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagara'', 1927), [[B.A. Saletore]] (''Social and Political Life in the Vijayanagara Empire'', 1930), G.S. Gai (Archaeological Survey of India), William Coelho (''The Hoysala Vamsa'', 1955) and Kamath (Kamath 2001, pp157–160)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;karma&quot;&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulke&quot;&gt;Kulke and Rothermund (2004), p188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;Rice (1897), p345&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that they were Telugu people first associated with the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya kingdom]] who took control of the northern parts of the [[Hoysala Empire]] during its decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;telguorigin&quot;&gt;Robert Sewell (''A Forgotten Empire Vijayanagar: A Contribution to the History of India'', 1901), Nilakanta Sastri (1955), N. Ventakaramanayya (''The Early Muslim expansion in South India'', 1942) and B. Surya Narayana Rao (''History of Vijayanagar'', 1993) in Kamath (2001) pp157–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by [[Vidyaranya]], a saint at the [[Sringeri]] monastery  to fight the Muslim invasion of South India.&lt;ref name=&quot;vidya&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastry (1955), p216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vidya1&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p160&lt;/ref&gt; Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much-needed information about the empire's history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural innovations.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;Portuguese travelers Barbosa, Barradas and Italian Varthema and Caesar Fredericci in 1567, Persian Abdur Razzak in 1440, Barani, Isamy, Tabataba, Nizamuddin Bakshi, [[Ferishta]] and Shirazi and vernacular works from the 14th century to the 16th century. (Kamath 2001, pp157–158)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;discover&quot;&gt;Fritz &amp; Michell (2001) pp1–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the early 14th-century rise of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Hindu states of the Deccan, the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava Empire]] of Devagiri, the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya Kingdom]] of [[Warangal]], the [[Pandyan Empire]] of [[Madurai]], and the tiny kingdom of [[Kampili]] had been repeatedly invaded by [[Muslim]]s from the north, and by 1336 they had all been defeated by [[Alla-ud-din Khilji]] and [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]]. The [[Hoysala Empire]] was the sole remaining Hindu state in the path of the Muslim invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;onlykingdom&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p216&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Hoysala king [[Veera Ballala III]] during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala Empire merged with the growing Vijayanagara empire.

In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of ''Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara'' (&quot;master of the eastern and western seas&quot;). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of [[Arcot]], the [[Reddy]]s of Kondavidu, the [[Madurai Sultanate|Sultan of Madurai]] and gained control over [[Goa]] in the west and the Tungabhadra-[[Krishna River]] [[doab]] in the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;femalepoet&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vijayama1&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p317&lt;/ref&gt; The original capital was in the [[principality]] of [[Anegondi]] on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's [[Karnataka]]. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I. 

With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in stature, [[Harihara II]], the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the [[Krishna River]] and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.&lt;ref name=&quot;umbrella&quot;&gt;The success was probably also due to the peaceful nature of Muhammad II Bahmani, according to Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p242&lt;/ref&gt; The next ruler, [[Deva Raya I]], emerged successful against the [[Gajapatis]] of [[Orissa]] and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;aqueduct&quot;&gt;From the notes of Portuguese Nuniz. Robert Sewell notes that a big dam across was built the Tungabhadra and an aqueduct {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} long was cut out of rock (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p243).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deva Raya II]] (called ''Gajabetekara'')&lt;ref name=&quot;hunter&quot;&gt;Also deciphered as ''Gajaventekara'', a metaphor for &quot;great hunter of his enemies&quot;, or &quot;hunter of elephants&quot; (Kamath 2001, p163).&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the [[Sangama Dynasty|Sangama dynasty]] rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunter1&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p244&lt;/ref&gt; He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the [[Zamorin]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] and [[Quilon]] in the south. He invaded the island of [[Lanka]] and became overlord of the kings of [[Burma]] at [[Pegu]] and [[Tanintharyi Division|Tanasserim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burma&quot;&gt;From the notes of Persian Abdur Razzak. Writings of Nuniz confirms that the kings of Burma paid tributes to Vijayanagara empire (Nilakanta Sastri 1955, p245)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burma1&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bidjanagar&quot;&gt;From the notes of Abdur Razzak about Vijayanagara: ''a city like this had not been seen by the pupil of the eye nor had an ear heard of anything equal to it in the world'' (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'' 2003, p11)&lt;/ref&gt; The empire declined in the late 15th century until the serious attempts by commander [[Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya]] in 1485 and by general [[Tuluva Narasa Nayaka]] in 1491 to reconsolidate the empire.

After nearly two decades of conflict with rebellious chieftains, the empire eventually came under the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishna Deva Raya]], the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka.&lt;ref name=&quot;great&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p250&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following decades the Vijayanagara empire dominated all of Southern India and fought off invasions from the five established [[Deccan Sultanates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;civilization&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;civilization1&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p159&lt;/ref&gt; The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect&quot;&gt;From the notes of Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes about Krishna Deva Raya: ''A king who was perfect in all things'' (''Hampi, A Travel Guide'' 2003, p31)&lt;/ref&gt; The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;richcity&quot;&gt;The notes of Portuguese Barbosa during the time of Krishna Deva Raya confirms a very rich and well provided Vijayanagara city (Kamath 2001, p186)&lt;/ref&gt; Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya.&lt;ref name=&quot;dibba&quot;&gt;Most monuments including the royal platform (''Mahanavami Dibba'') were actually built over a period spanning several decades (Dallapiccola 2001, p66)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Krishna Deva Raya was followed by his younger brother [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] in 1529 and in 1542 by [[Sadashiva Raya]] while the real power lay with [[Aliya Rama Raya]], the son-in-law of Krishna Deva Raya, whose relationship with the Deccan Sultans who allied against him has been debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;involve&quot;&gt;Dr. P. B. Desai asserts that Rama Raya's involvement often was at the insistence of one Sultan or the other (Kamath 2001, p172).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sudden capture and killing of Aliya Rama Raya in 1565 at the [[Battle of Talikota]], against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies, created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army later plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied. [[Tirumala Deva Raya]], Rama Raya's younger brother who was the sole surviving commander, left Vijayanagara for [[Penukonda]] with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 1500 elephants.&lt;ref name=&quot;venue1&quot;&gt;Some scholars say the war was actually fought between Rakkasagi and Tangadigi in modern [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur district]], close to Talikota, and the battle is also called &quot;Battle of Rakkasa-Tangadi&quot;. Shervani claimed that the actual venue of the battle was Bannihatti (Kamath 2001, p170)&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire went into a slow decline regionally, although trade with the Portuguese continued, and the British were given a land grant for the establishment of [[Madras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reviver&quot;&gt;The Telugu work ''Vasucharitamu'' refers to Aravidu King Tirumala Deva Raya (1570) as the ''reviver of the [[Karnata Empire]]''.(Ramesh 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reviver1&quot;&gt;Nilakanta Sastri (1955), p268&lt;/ref&gt; Tirumala Deva Raya was succeeded by his son [[Sriranga I]] later followed by [[Venkata II]] who was the last great king of Vijayanagara empire and made [[Chandragiri]], [[Vellore]] his capital, repulsed the invasion of the [[Deccan Sultanates]] and saved [[Penukonda]] from being captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p174&lt;/ref&gt; 

His successor [[Rama Deva Raya]] took power and ruled until 1632, after whose death [[Venkata III]] became king and ruled for about ten years . The empire was finally conquered by the [[Sultanate]]s of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Golkonda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;/&gt; The largest feudatories of the Vijayanagar empire&amp;nbsp;– the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore Kingdom]], [[Keladi Nayaka]], [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Nayaks of Madurai]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks|Nayaks of Tanjore]], [[Nayakas of Chitradurga]] and [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak Kingdom]] of [[Gingee]]  palegars of gummanayakanapalya&amp;nbsp;– declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries. These Nayaka kingdoms lasted into the 18th century while the Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until [[Indian Independence]] in 1947 although they came under the [[British Raj]] in 1799 after the death of [[Tipu Sultan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;capital1&quot;&gt;Kamath (2001), p220, p226, p234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nayak kingdoms===

Vijayangara empire had established military and administrative governors called Nayakas to rule in the various territories of the empire. After the demise of the Vijayanagara empire, the local governors declared their independence and started their rule. The [[Madurai nayak|Nayak of Madurai]], [[Nayaks of Tanjore]], [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of [[Shimoga]], [[Nayakas of Chitradurga]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore]] were the most prominent of them. Raghunatha Nayak (1600–1645) was the greatest of the Tanjavur Nayaks. Raghunatha Nayak encouraged trade and permitted a Danish settlement in 1620 at Danesborg at Tarangambadi. This laid the foundation of future European involvement in the affairs of the country. The success of the Dutch inspired the English to seek trade with Thanjavur, which was to lead to far-reaching repercussions. Vijaya Raghava (1631–1675 CE) was the last of the Thanjavur Nayaks. Nayaks reconstructed some of the oldest temples in the country and their contributions can be seen even today. Nayaks expanded the existing temples with large pillared halls, and tall gateway towers was a striking feature in the religious architecture of this period. Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar and [[Tipu Sultan]] from the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], Madhukari Nayaka of [[Chitradurga]] Nayaka clan and Venkatappa Nayaka of [[Keladi]] dynasty are the most famous among the post Vijayanagar rulers from Kannada country. 

In Madurai, [[Thirumalai Nayak]] was the most famous Nayak ruler. He patronised art and architecture creating new structures and expanding the existing landmarks in and around Madurai. His landmark buildings are the Meenakshi Temple Gopurams and Thirumalai Nayak Palace in Madurai. On Thirumalai Nayak's death in 1659 CE, other notable ruler was [[Rani Mangammal]]. Shivaji Bhonsle, the great Maratha Ruler, invaded the south, as did Chikka Deva Raya of Mysore and other Muslim Rulers, resulting in chaos and instability and the Madurai Nayak Kingdom collapsed in 1736 following internal strife.
 
The [[Tanjavur Nayaks]] ruled till late 17th century until their dynasty was put to an end by Madurai Rulers, and the Marathas grabbing the opportunity to install their ruler. The Tanjavur Nayak kings were notable for their contribution to Arts and [[Telugu literature]].

===Rise of the Marathas===
{{Main|Maratha Empire}}
[[Image:Mysore Palace at dusk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mysore Palace]] in [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]].]]
The rise of [[Maratha]] military power under [[Shivaji]] and his heirs in the immediate north of what is today considered South India had a profound influence on the political situation of South India, with Maratha control quickly extending as far east as [[Ganjam]] and as far south as [[Thanjavur]]. Following the death of Aurangzeb, Mughal power withered, and South Indian rulers gained autonomy from Delhi. The [[Wodeyar]] kingdom of [[Mysore]], which was originally in tribute to Vijayanagara and gained in strength over the next few decades, subsequently emerging as the dominant power in the southern part of South India. The [[Asaf Jahis]] of Hyderabad controlled the territory north and east of Mysore, while the Marathas controlled portions of what is today [[Karnataka]]. By the close of the &quot;medieval&quot; period, most of South India was either ruled directly from, or under tribute to Nayak dynasty or Wodeyars.

==Modern history==

===Colonial period===
[[Image:1800 Faden Rennell Wall Map of India - Geographicus - India-faden-1795.jpg|thumb|right|South India in 1800]]
In the middle of the 18th century, the French and the British East India company initiated a protracted struggle for military control of South India. The period was marked by shifting alliances between the two East India companies and the local powers, mercenary armies employed by all sides, and general anarchy in South India. Cities and forts changed hands many times, and soldiers were primarily remunerated through loot. The four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] and the three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] saw Mysore, the Marathas and Hyderabad aligning themselves in turns with either the British or the French. Eventually, British power in alliance with Hyderabad prevailed and Mysore was absorbed as a [[princely state]] within British India. The Nizam of Hyderabad sought to retain his autonomy through diplomacy rather than open war with the British. The Maratha Empire that stretched across large swathes of central and northern India was broken up, with most of it annexed by the British.

===British South India===

South India during the British colonial rule was divided into the [[Madras Presidency]] and [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [[Thiruvithamcoore]] (also known as Travancore), [[Cochin]], [[Vizianagaram]] and a number of other minor princely states. The Madras Presidency was ruled directly by the British, while the rulers of the princely states enjoyed considerable internal autonomy. British Residents were stationed in the capitals of the important states to supervise and report on the activities of the rulers. British troops were stationed in cantonments near the capitals to curb the potential of rebellion. The rulers of these states accepted the principle of paramountcy of the British Crown. The larger princely states issued their own currency and built their own railroads—with non-standard gauges which would be incompatible with their neighbors. The cultivation of [[coffee]] and [[tea]] was introduced to the mountainous regions of South India during the British period, and both remain important cash crops.

===After Independence===

On August 15, 1947, the former British India achieved independence as the new dominions of India and Pakistan. The rulers of India's princely states acceded to the government of India between 1947 and 1950, and South India was organized into a number of new states. Most of South India was included in Madras state, which included the territory of the former Madras Presidency together with the princely states of Banganapalle, Pudukkottai, and Sandur. The other states in South India were Coorg (the erstwhile Coorg province of British India), Mysore State (the former princely state of Mysore) and [[Travancore-Cochin]], formed from the merger of the princely states of Travancore and Cochin. The former princely state of Hyderabad became Hyderabad State, and erstwhile Bombay Presidency became [[Bombay State]].

In 1953, the [[Nehru]] government yielded to intense pressure from the northern [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking districts of Madras State, and allowed them to vote to create India's first linguistic state. [[Andhra State]] was created on October 1, 1953 from the northern districts of Madras State, with its capital in [[Kurnool]]. Increasing demands for reorganisation of the patchwork of India's states resulted in the formation of a national States Reorganisation Commission. Based on the commission's recommendations, [[Parliament|Parliament of India]] enacted the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956, which reorganized the boundaries of India's states along linguistic lines. Andhra State was renamed [[Andhra Pradesh]], and enlarged by the addition of Telugu-speaking region of [[Telingana]], formerly part of Hyderabad State. Mysore State was enlarged by the addition of Coorg and the [[Kannada language|Kannada]]-speaking districts of southwestern Hyderabad State and southern Bombay State. The new [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]-speaking state of Kerala was created by the merger of Travancore-Cochin with [[Malabar District|Malabar]] and [[Kasaragod District|Kasargod]] districts of Madras State. Madras State, which after 1956 included the [[Tamil people|Tamil]]-majority regions of South India, changed its name to [[Tamil Nadu]] in 1968, and Mysore State was renamed Karnataka in 1972. [[Portuguese India]], which included [[Goa]], was annexed by India in 1961, and Goa became a state in 1987. The enclaves of [[French India]] were ceded to India in the 1950s, and the southern four were organised into the [[union territory]] of [[Pondicherry]].
