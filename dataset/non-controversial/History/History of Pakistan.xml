[[File:Historic pakistan rel96b.JPG|300px|right|A map outlining Pakistan's historical sites]]

The first known inhabitants of the modern-day [[Pakistan]] region are believed to have been the [[Soanian]] (''Homo erectus''), who settled in the [[Soan Valley]] and [[Riwat]] 1.9 million years ago. Over the next several thousand years, the region would develop into various civilizations like [[Mehrgarh]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Prior to the independence as a modern state in 1947, the country was both independent and under various colonial empires throughout different time periods. The region's ancient history also includes some of the oldest empires from the [[Indian Subcontinent|subcontinent]]&lt;ref name=&quot;coppa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coppa|first=A.|coauthors=L.

By the 18th century the land was incorporated into [[British India]]. The political history of the nation began with the birth of the [[All India Muslim League]] in 1906 to protect Muslim interests, amid neglect and under-representation, in case the [[British Raj]] decided to grant local self-rule. On 29 December 1930, [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]] called for an autonomous state in &quot;northwestern India for Indian Muslims&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aips&quot;/&gt; The League rose to popularity in the late 1930s. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] espoused the ''[[Two Nation Theory]]'' and led the League to adopt the ''[[Lahore Resolution]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;resolution&quot;/&gt; of 1940, demanding the formation of independent states in the East and the West of [[British India]]. Eventually, a united Pakistan with its wings – [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]] – gained independence from the [[British India|British]], on [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|14 August 1947]]. After a civil war, the Bengal region of [[East Pakistan]], separated at a considerable distance from the rest of Pakistan, became the independent state of [[Bangladesh]] in 1971.

Pakistan declared itself an [[Islamic republic]] on adoption of a constitution in 1956, but the civilian rule was stalled by the 1958 military [[coup d'etat]] by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], who ruled during a period of internal instability and a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965. Economic grievances and political disenfranchisement in [[East Pakistan]] led to violent political tensions and army repression, escalating into [[Bangladesh War of Independence|civil war]]&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwar&quot;/&gt; followed by the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|third war]] with India. Pakistan's defeat in the war ultimately led to the secession of East Pakistan and the birth of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uscsbn&quot;/&gt;

Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], until he was deposed by General [[Zia-ul-Haq]], who became the country's third military president. Pakistan's Obsolete-[[secular]] policies were replaced by the new Islamic [[Sharia]]h legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of Zia-ul-Haq in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. Over the next decade, she alternated power with [[Nawaz Sharif]], as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Military tensions in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kargil&quot;/&gt; with India were followed by a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|1999 coup d'état]] in which General [[Pervez Musharraf]] assumed executive powers.

In 2001, Musharraf named himself [[President of Pakistan|President]] after the resignation of [[Rafiq Tarar]]. In the 2002 Parliamentary Elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]], who was succeeded in the 2004 by [[Shaukat Aziz]]. On 15 November 2007 the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] completed its term and a caretaker government was appointed with the former Chairman of The Senate, [[Muhammad Mian Soomro]] as Prime Minister. Following the [[assassination of Benazir Bhutto]], that resulted in a series of important political developments, her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]] was eventually elected as the new President in 2008.

=== Soanian Culture ===
{{Main|Soanian}}
[[File:Neolithic mehrgarh.jpg|thumb|An early farming village in Mehrgarh, c. 7000 [[BCE]], with houses built with mud bricks. ([[Musée Guimet]], Paris).]]
The [[Soanian]] is an archaeological culture of the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (ca. 1.9 mya to 125,000 &amp;nbsp;BC), contemporary to the [[Acheulean]]. It is named after the [[Soan Valley]] in the Sivalik Hills, near modern-day [[Islamabad]]/[[Rawalpindi]], Pakistan. The bearers of this culture were [[Homo erectus]]. In [[Adiyala]] and [[Khasala]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2011}}, about {{convert|16|km|mi}} from Rawalpindi, on the bend of the [[Soan River]] hundreds of edged pebble tools were discovered. No human skeletons of this age have yet been found. In the Soan River Gorge many fossil bearing rocks are exposed on the surface. The 14 million year old fossils of gazelle, rhinoceros, crocodile, giraffe and rodents have been found there. Some of these fossils are on display at the Natural History Museum in Islamabad.

=== Mehrgarh ===
{{Main|Mehrgarh}}
[[Mehrgarh]], (7000–5500 [[Common Era|BCE]]), on the Kachi Plain of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]], is an important [[Neolithic]] site discovered in 1974, with early evidence of farming and herding,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, K. Kris. 2005. [http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/mehrgarh.htm &quot;Mehrgarh&quot;]. ''Guide to Archaeology''&lt;/ref&gt; and dentistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppa&quot;/&gt; Early residents lived in mud brick houses, stored grain in granaries, fashioned tools with [[Copper Age|copper ore]], cultivated barley, wheat, [[jujube]]s and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. As the civilization progressed (5500–2600 BCE) residents began to engage in crafts, including [[Flintknapper|flint knapping]], [[tanning]], bead production, and [[metalworking]]. The site was occupied continuously until 2600 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Possehl|Possehl, Gregory L.]] 1996. &quot;Mehrgarh.&quot; ''Oxford Companion to Archaeology'', edited by Brian Fagan. Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; when climatic changes began to occur. Between 2600 and 2000 BCE, region became more arid and Mehrgarh was abandoned in favour of the Indus Valley,&lt;ref name=guimet&gt;[http://www.guimet.fr/Indus-and-Mehrgarh-archaeological The Centre for Archaeological Research Indus Balochistan], Musée National des Arts Asiatiques&amp;nbsp;— Guimet&lt;/ref&gt; where a [[Indus Valley Civilization|new civilization]] was in the early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Graham. 1999.

=== Indus Valley Civilization ===
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
The Indus Valley Civilization developed between 3300–1700 BCE on the banks of the [[Indus River]]. At its peak, the civilisation hosted a population of approximately 5 million in hundreds of settlements extending as far as the [[Arabian Sea]], present-day southern and eastern [[Afghanistan]], southeastern [[Iran]] and the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Feuerstein|first=Georg|coauthors=Subhash Kak; David Frawley|title=In search of the cradle of civilization: new light on ancient India|publisher=Quest Books|location=Wheaton, Illinois|year=1995|page=147|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kbx7q0gxyTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=In+Search+of+the+Cradle+of+Civilization|isbn=978-0-8356-0720-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major urban centers were at [[Dholavira]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Harappa]], [[Lothal]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], and [[Rakhigarhi]], as well as an offshoot called the [[Kulli culture]] (2500–2000 BCE) in southern Balochistan, which had similar settlements, pottery and other artifacts. The civilization collapsed abruptly around 1700 BCE.

In the early part of the second millennium BCE, the Rigvedic civilization existed,&lt;ref name=&quot;stein&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Burton|title=A history of India|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford (UK); Malden (Mass.)|year=1998|isbn=978-0-631-17899-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Sapta Sindhu]] and [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] rivers.&lt;ref name=britannica-early-vedic&gt;&quot;Early Aryan Period.&quot; 2007.

[[File:Indo-Iranian origins.png|thumb|200px|Archaeological cultures. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with [[Indo-Aryans]].]]
Early Vedic society consisted of largely pastoral groups, with late Harappan urbanization having been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46838/India India: Reemergence of Urbanization]. Retrieved 2007-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt; After the time of the [[Rigveda]], Aryan society became increasingly agricultural and was socially organized around the four ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]]'', or social classes. In addition to the Vedas, the principal texts of Hinduism, the core themes of the Sanskrit epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are said to have their ultimate origins during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The later part of this period corresponds with an increasing movement away from the previous tribal system towards the establishment of kingdoms, called ''[[mahajanapadas]]''.

=== Achaemenid Empire ===
{{Main|Achaemenid Empire}}
[[File:Map achaemenid empire en.png|thumb|Much of modern-day Pakistan was subordinated to the Achaemenid Empire and forced to pay tributes to Persia]]
Little is known about the Achaemenid Persian invasion of modern-day [[Pakistan]] as historical sources and evidence are scant and fragmentary containing little detail. There is no archaeological evidence of Achaemind control over modern-day Pakistan as not a single archaeological site that can be positively identified with the Achaemenid Empire has been found anywhere in Pakistan, including at [[Taxila]].&lt;ref&gt;[Histories, epigraphy and authority: Achaemenid and indigenous control in Pakistan in the 1st millennium BC] http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/bannu-archaeological-project/petrie2007_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; What is known about the easternmost satraps and borderlands of the Achaemenid Empire are alluded to in the [[Darius the Great|Darius]] inscriptions and from Greek sources such as the ''Histories'' of [[Herodotus]] and the later ''Alexander Chronicles'' (Arrian, Strabo et al.). These sources list three Indian tributaries or conquered territories that were subordinated to the Persian Empire and made to pay tributes to the Persian Kings: [[Gandhara]], [[Sattagydia]] (Thatagus) and [[Hindush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arch.cam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/bannu-archaeological-project/petrie2007_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhara and Sattagydia (Thatagus) are listed amongst the provinces inherited by Darius when he seized the throne in 522 BC in his commemorative Behistun inscription, however, the dates of the initial annexation of these two regions is not certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;arch.cam.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; The locations of Sattagydia and Hindush and the extent of their boundaries have not been identified either though it is certain that these two tributaries existed along the river Indus as the name Hindush is analogous with the Indus and was derived by the Persians from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu''.

Additionally, much of what constitutes [[Balochistan]] province in southwest Pakistan formed part of the Achaemenid satrap of [[Gedrosia]].&lt;ref&gt;[A.B. Bosworth, &quot;Conquest and Empire: The Reign of Alexander the Great.&quot; 1988. p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek invasion ===
[[File:Gedrosia-Map-Route-of-Alexander-1823-Lucas.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing the route of Alexander the Great]]
{{Main|Alexander the Great}}
Crushing the Persian Achaemenid empire, [[Alexander the Great]], the Greek king from [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], eventually invaded the region of modern Pakistan and conquered much of the [[Punjab region]]. After defeating [[King Porus]] in the fierce [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] (modern day [[Jhelum]]), his battle weary troops refused to advance further into India&lt;ref name=&quot;plutarch62&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarchus|first=Mestrius|authorlink=Plutarch|coauthors=Bernadotte Perrin (trans.)|title=Plutarch's Lives|publisher=William Heinemann|year=1919|location=London|pages=Ch.

Therefore, Alexander proceeded southwest along the Indus valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutarch63&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarchus|first=Mestrius|authorlink=Plutarch|coauthors=Bernadotte Perrin (trans.)|title=Plutarch's Lives|publisher=William Heinemann|year=1919|location=London|pages=Ch.

Alexander founded several new Macedonian and Greek settlements in [[Gandhara]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. During that time, many Greeks settled all over in Pakistan{{Dubious|date=July 2012}}, initiating interaction between the culture of [[Hellenistic Greece]] and the region's prevalent [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] cultures.

{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
After Alexander's untimely death in 323 BC, his ''[[Diadochi]]'' (generals) divided the empire among themselves, with the Macedonian warlord [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] setting up the [[Seleucid Kingdom]], which included the Indus plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;appian&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Appian of Alexandria|authorlink=Appian|coauthors=Horace White (trans.)|title=The Roman History of Appian of Alexandria|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.|year=1899|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 250 BCE, the eastern part of the Seleucid Kingdom broke away to form the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

=== Maurya Empire ===
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|Mauryan Empire under [[Ashoka the Great]]]]
{{Main|Maurya Empire}}
Modern day Pakistan was conquered by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], who overthrew the powerful [[Nanda Dynasty]] of [[Magadha]] and established Maurya empire: He conquered the trans-[[Indus]] region to the west, which was under Macedonian rule - annexing [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]], south eastern parts of [[Iran]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], including the modern [[Herat Province|Herat]]&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesFarEast/India_IronAge_Mauryas01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] provinces - and then defeated the invasion led by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]], a Greek general from Alexander's army. Seleucus is said to have reach a [[peace treaty]] with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to him upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.

{{quote|''Alexander took these away from the [[Indo-Aryans]] and established settlements of his own, but [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]] gave them to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Sandrocottus]] ([[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]), upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange 500 elephants.''&lt;ref name=&quot;aisk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php |title=An Historical Guide to Kabul: The Name |author=Nancy Hatch Dupree / Aḥmad ʻAlī Kuhzād|publisher=American International School of Kabul |year=1972 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Strabo]]|64 BC–24 AD}}

The Empire was expanded into India's central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and [[Bindusara]], but it excluded a small portion of unexplored tribal and forested regions near [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Orissa]]), till it was conquered by [[Ashoka]]. With an area of 5,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was one of the world's [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] in its time, and the largest ever in the Indian subcontinent. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the [[Himalayas]], and to the east stretching into what is now [[Assam]] province near the border with modern [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]). 

Under Chandragupta and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture and economic activities, all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Mauryans were followers of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of [[Jainism]] increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of [[Buddhism]] has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of [[South Asia]]. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist ideals into [[Sri Lanka]], Southeast Asia, West Asia and Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;/&gt; After the [[Kalinga War]], the Empire experienced half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan Empire's decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, and it dissolved in 185 BC with the foundation of the [[Sunga Dynasty]] in Magadha.

===Gandhara culture===
Greco-Buddhism (or Græco-Buddhism) was the [[syncretism]] between the culture of [[History of Hellenistic Greece|Classical Greece]] and [[Buddhism]] in the then [[Gandhara]] region of modern [[Afghanistan]] and Pakistan, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcevilly&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McEvilley|first=Thomas|title=The shape of ancient thought|publisher=Allworth Press|year=2002|location=New York|url=http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=Vpqr1vNWQhUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+shape+of+ancient+thought%7C+publisher&amp;sig=mLs2tF5QycF9U5uIj9vEsElLbpI|isbn=978-1-58115-203-6|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the artistic development of Buddhism, and in particular [[Mahayana Buddhism]], before it spread to central and eastern Asia, from the 1st century CE onward. [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] (son of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]]) invaded northern India in 180 BCE as far as [[Pataliputra]] and established an [[Indo-Greek kingdom]]. To the south, the Greeks captured [[Sindh]] and nearby coastal areas, completing the invasion by 175 BCE and confining the borders of [[Sungas|Sunga's]] ([[Magadha Empire]]) to the east. Meanwhile, in Bactria, the usurper [[Eucratides]] killed Demetrius in a battle. Although the Indo-Greeks lost part of the Gangetic plain, their kingdom lasted nearly two centuries.

The Indo-Greek [[Menander I]] (reigned 155–130 BCE) drove the Greco-Bactrians out of [[Gandhara]] and beyond the [[Hindu Kush]], becoming a king shortly after his victory. His territories covered [[Panjshir province|Panjshir]] and [[Kapisa]] in modern Afghanistan and extended to the [[Punjab region]], with many tributaries to the south and east, possibly as far as [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. The capital [[Sagala]] (modern [[Sialkot]]) prospered greatly under Menander's rule and Menander is one of the few Bactrian kings mentioned by Greek authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;strabo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|authorlink=Strabo|coauthors=H.

Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king [[Heliocles]], son of Eucratides, fled from the [[Yuezhi]] invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the [[Jhelum River]]. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was [[Theodamas]], from the [[Bajaur]] area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st century CE signet ring, bearing the Kharoṣṭhī inscription ''&quot;Su Theodamasa&quot;'' (''&quot;Su&quot;'' was the Greek transliteration of the [[Kushan]] royal title ''&quot;Shau&quot;'' (&quot;[[Shah]]&quot; or &quot;King&quot;)). Various petty kings ruled into the early 1st century CE, until the conquests by the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythians]], [[Indo-Parthians|Parthians]] and the Yuezhi, who founded the Kushan dynasty.

===Indo-Scythians===
[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100&amp;nbsp;BC.png|250px|right]]
The [[Indo-Scythians]] were descended from the [[Sakas]] (Scythians) who migrated from southern [[Siberia]] to [[pakistan]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} and [[Arachosia]] from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the Indo-Greeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from Gandhara to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. Scythian tribes spread into the present-day Pakistan region and the Iranian plateau.

===Indo-Parthians, Romans and Christianity===
The [[Parni]], a nomadic Central Asian tribe, invaded [[Parthia]] in the middle of the 3rd century BCE, drove away its Greek satraps&amp;nbsp;— who had just then proclaimed independence from the Seleucids&amp;nbsp;— and annexed much of the Indus region, thus founding an [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacids]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} dynasty of Scythian or Bactrian origin. Following the decline of the central [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] authority after clashes with the [[Roman Empire]], a local Parthian leader, [[Gondophares]] established the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] in the 1st century CE. The kingdom was ruled from [[Taxila]] and covered much of modern southeast Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;earrings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymount.k12.ny.us/marynet/stwbwk05/05vm/earrings/html/emanalysis.html|title=Parthian Pair of Earrings|publisher=Marymount School, New York|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christian writings claim&lt;!-- Ref. WP Article on St. Thomas --&gt; that the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] – an architect and skilled carpenter – had a long sojourn in the court of king [[Gondophares]], had built a palace for the king at [[Taxila]] and had also ordained leaders for the Church before leaving for [[Indus Valley]] in a chariot, for sailing out to eventually reach [[Malabar Coast]].

=== Kushan Empire ===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The Kushan kingdom was founded by King [[Heraios]], and greatly expanded by his successor, [[Kujula Kadphises]]. Kadphises' son, [[Vima Takto]] conquered territory now in India, but lost much of the west of the kingdom to the Parthians. The fourth Kushan emperor, [[Kanishka]] I, (c. 127 CE) had a winter capital at Purushapura ([[Peshawar]]) and a summer capital at Kapisa ([[Bagram]]). The kingdom linked the [[Indian Ocean]] maritime trade with the commerce of the [[Silk Road]] through the Indus valley. At its height, the empire extended from the [[Aral Sea]] to northern India, encouraging long-distance trade, particularly between [[China]] and [[Roman empire|Rome]]. Kanishka convened a great Buddhist council in Taxila, marking the start of the pantheistic [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and its scission with [[Nikaya Buddhism]]. The art and culture of Gandhara&amp;nbsp;— the best known expressions of the interaction of Greek and Buddhist cultures&amp;nbsp;— also continued over several centuries, until the 5th century CE [[Huna (people)|White Hun]] invasions of [[Scythia]]. The travelogues of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa Xian]] (337 – ca.422 CE) and [[Huen Tsang]] (602/603–664 CE) describe the state of famed [[Buddhist]] seminary at [[Taxila]] and the status of [[Buddhism]] in the region of Pakistan in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Si-Yu-Ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World, (Tr.

The empire gradually declined due in part to loss of territory and imperial authority caused by their own erstwhile feudatories, and from the invasion by the [[Huna people|Huna]]s from Central Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;aa&quot;&gt;Agarwal, Ashvini (1989).

These Guptas were ultimately ousted by the Vardhana king [[Harsha]], who established an empire in the first half of the 7th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Sassanid Empire===
Over the next few centuries, while the Parthians and Kushans shared control of the Indus plain until the arrival of the White Huns, the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] dominated the south and southwest. The revival of [[Persian culture]]s in the region gave rise to the [[Sassanid]] culture, which initially flourished in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Western Punjab]], but later spread to all of Pakistan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}{{Dubious|date=July 2012}}

===The White Huns===
The [[White Huns]], who seem to have been part of the predominantly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Hephthalites|Hephthalite]] group, established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century, with their capital at [[Bamyan City|Bamiyan]]. Led by the Hun military leader [[Toramana]], they overran the northern region of Pakistan and made their capital at the city of Sakala, modern [[Sialkot]] in [[Pakistan]], under Toramana's son, Emperor [[Mihirakula]], who was a [[Saivite]] [[Hindu]]. Hiuen Tsiang narrates Mihirakula's merciless persecution of Buddhists and destruction of monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Hiuen Tsiang, Si-Yu-Ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World, (Tr.

===Rai dynasty===
{{Main|Rai Dynasty}}
According to [[Chach Nama|Arab chroniclers]], the [[Rai Dynasty]] of [[Sindh]] (c. 489–632) arose after the end of [[Ror Dynasty]]. They were practitioners of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; they established a huge temple of [[Shiva]] in present-day [[Sukkur]] – derived from original [[Shankar (disambiguation)|Shankar]] – close to their capital in [[Alor (Sukkur)|Al-ror]].&lt;ref name=&quot; Thakur Deshraj &quot;&gt;Thakur Deshraj, Jat Itihas (Hindi), Maharaja Suraj Mal Smarak Shiksha Sansthan, Delhi, 1934, 2nd edition 1992&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Rai Diwaji (Devaditya), influence of the Rai-state exdended from [[Kashmir]] in the east, [[Makran]] and Debal ([[Karachi]]) port in the south, [[Kandahar]], [[Sistan]], Suleyman, Ferdan and Kikanan hills in the north.

{{double image|right|Pala Empire (Dharmapala).gif|160|Devapala.jpg|160|[[Pala Empire]] under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]]|'''Pala Empire''' under [[Devapala]]}}
After the collapse of the Gupta Empire, [[India]] was ruled by numerous regional kingdoms until the first half of the 7th century, when the Vardhana ruler [[Harsha]], a [[Bais Rajput]], established a vast empire. It disintegrated after his death, to be invaded by other Rajput warlords, soon after their victory over the Arab forces in Sindh, that set the eastern borders of Arab Sindh for a long time to come.

The Pāla's were a [[Buddhist]] dynasty of [[Bengal]], which lasted for four centuries (750–1120 AD). The empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]] to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond up to [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] (modern day [[Afghanistan]]), shattering the pride of many a ruler, including the [[Huna]]. Followers of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] schools of Buddhism, they were responsible for the introduction of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Tibet]], [[Myanmar]] and the [[Malay archipelago]], creation of temples and works of art and patronage of great universities formerly patronized by Emperor Harsha Vardhana. The Palas had extensive trade as well as influence in [[South-east Asia]]. The Pala Empire eventually disintegrated in the 12th century under the attack of the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]].

=== Arab Invasion ===
{{Main|Rashidun Caliphate|Umayyad Empire}}
{{Further|Battle of Rajasthan}}
Although soon after conquering the [[Middle East]] from the [[Byzantine empire]] Arab forces had reached the present western regions of Pakistan, during the period of [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphacy]], it was in 712 CE that a young Arab general called [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered most of the Indus region for the [[Umayyad]] empire, to be made the &quot;As-Sindh&quot; province with its capital at Al-Mansurah, {{convert|72|km|0|abbr=on}} north of modern [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] in [[Sindh]]. But the instability of the empire and the defeat in various wars with north Indian rulers including the [[Battle of Rajasthan]], where the [[Hindu]] [[Rajput]] clans defeated the [[Umayyad]] Arabs, they were contained till only [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. There was gradual conversion to [[Islam]] in the south, especially amongst the native Hindu and Buddhist majority, but in areas north of [[Multan]], Hindus and Buddhists remained numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Sindh. (2007). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 2007-03-15, from: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067903 Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several [[Hindu Shahi]] kings who would be subdued by the [[Ghaznavids]].

=== Ghaznavid Dynasty ===
{{Main|Ghaznavid Empire}}
In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], took over the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, Sebuktegin, a Turkic origin ruler. Starting from the city of [[Ghazni]] (now in [[Afghanistan]]), Mehmood conquered the bulk of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], marched on [[Peshawar#Arrival of Islam|Peshawar]] against the [[Hindu]] [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[History of the Punjab#The Shahi Kingdoms and the Muslim invasions|Punjab]] (1007), deposed the [[Shia]] [[Ismaili]] rulers of [[Multan]], (1011), Kashmir (1015) and Qanoch (1017). By the end of his reign in 1030, Mahmud's empire extended from [[Kurdistan]] in the west to the [[Yamuna]] river in the east, and the Ghaznavid dynasty lasted until 1187. Contemporary historians such as [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi]] and [[Ferdowsi]] described extensive building work in [[Lahore]], as well as Mahmud's support and patronage of learning, literature and the arts.

=== Delhi Sultanate ===
{{Main|Muhammad Ghori|Delhi Sultanate|Timurid Dynasty}}
In 1160, [[Muhammad Ghori]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ruler, conquered Ghazni from the Ghaznavids and became its governor in 1173. He for the first time named Sindh '''Tambade Gatar''' roughly translated as the red passage. He marched eastwards into the remaining Ghaznavid territory and Gujarat in the 1180s, but was rebuffed by Gujarat's [[Hindu]] [[Solanki]] rulers. In 1186–87, he conquered Lahore, bringing the last of Ghaznevid territory under his control and ending the Ghaznavid empire. Muhammad Ghori's successors established the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The Turkic origin [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Mamluk Dynasty]], (''mamluk means &quot;owned&quot; and referred to the Turkic youths bought and trained as soldiers who became rulers throughout the Islamic world''), seized the throne of the Sultanate in 1211. Several Central Asian Turkic dynasties ruled their empires from Delhi: the Mamluk (1211–90), the [[Khalji]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]] (1320–1413), the [[Sayyid]] (1414–51) and the [[Lodhi]] (1451–1526). Although some kingdoms remained independent of Delhi – in Gujarat, [[Malwa]] (central India), Bengal and [[Deccan]] – almost all of the Indus plain came under the rule of these large sultanates.

The sultans (emperors) of Delhi enjoyed cordial relations with rulers in the [[Near East]] but owed them no allegiance.
While the sultans ruled from urban centers, their military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for many towns that sprang up in the countryside. Close interaction with local populations led to cultural exchange and the resulting &quot;Indo-Islamic&quot; fusion has left a lasting imprint and legacy in South Asian architecture, music, literature, life style and religious customs. In addition, the language of [[Urdu]] (literally meaning &quot;horde&quot; or &quot;camp&quot; in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period, as a result of the mingling of speakers of native [[Prakrit]]s, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages.

Perhaps the greatest contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating South Asia from the [[Chagatai Khanate|Mongol invasion from Central Asia]] in the 13th century; nonetheless the sultans eventually lost [[Afghanistan]] and western Pakistan to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] (see the [[Ilkhanate]] Dynasty). The Sultanate declined after the invasion of Emperor [[Timur]], who founded the [[Timurid Dynasty]], and was eventually conquered in 1526 by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] king [[Babur|Babar]].

[[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539), was born in the village of ''Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī'', now called [[Nankana]], near [[Sial]] in modern-day Pakistan into a [[Hindu]] [[Khatri]] family. He was an influential religious and social reformer of north India and the saintly founder of a modern monothiestic order and first of the ten divine [[Gurus]] of [[Sikhism|Sikh Religion]]. At the age of 70, he had a miraculous death in [[Kartarpur, India|Cartarpur]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]] of modern-day [[Pakistan]]. Sikhism was created and would continue to grow; its followers, the [[Sikhs]], would politicalise and militarise to play a historic role later.

=== Mughal Empire ===
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}
[[File:MughalEmpire1700.svg|thumb|right|Mughal Empire at its peak]]

In 1526, [[Babur]], a [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] descendant of [[Timur]] and [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] from [[Fergana Valley]] (modern day [[Uzbekistan]]), swept across the [[Khyber Pass]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]], covering modern day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Great Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mughals were descended from Central Asian [[Turkic people|Turks]] (with significant [[Mongol]] admixture). However, his son [[Humayun]] was defeated by the Afghan warrior [[Sher Shah Suri]] who was from Bihar state of India, in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to [[Kabul]]. After Sher Shah died, his son [[Islam Shah Suri]] became the ruler, on whose death his prime minister, Hemu ascended the throne and ruled North India from [[Delhi]] for one month. He was defeated by Emperor [[Akbar]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Panipat (1556)|Second Battle of Panipat]] on 6 November 1556.

[[Akbar the Great]], was both a capable ruler and an early proponent of religious and ethnic [[Toleration|tolerance]] and favored an early form of [[multiculturalism]]. He declared &quot;Amari&quot; or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism and rolled back the ''[[jizya]]'' tax imposed upon non-Islamic mainly Hindu people. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The Mughal emperors married local royalty and allied themselves with local ''[[maharajas]]''. For a short time in the late 16th century, [[Lahore]] was the capital of the empire. The architectural legacy of the Mughals in Lahore includes the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] built by the fifth Emperor [[Shahjahan]], and the [[Badshahi Mosque]] built by the sixth Emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], who is regarded as the last Great Mughal Emperor as he expanded the domain to its zenith. After his demise, different regions of modern Pakistan began asserting independence. The empire went into a slow decline after 1707 and its last sovereign, ruling around [[Delhi]] region.

====Durrani Empire====
In 1739, [[Nader Shah]], the Turkic emperor of [[Afsharid dynasty]] in Persia, invaded South Asia, defeated the Mughal Emperor [[Muhammad Shah|Mohammed Shah]] at the huge [[Battle of Karnal]], and occupied most of Balochistan and the Indus plain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Shah.php Iran in the Age of the Raj]&lt;/ref&gt; After Nadir Shah's death, the ''Durrani kingdom'' was established in 1747 by one of his [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] generals, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], and included Balochistan, Peshawar, Daman, Multan, Sind and Punjab. In the south, a succession of autonomous dynasties (the [[Daudpota]]s, [[Kalhora Dynasty|Kalhoras]] and [[Talpur dynasty|Talpurs]]) had asserted the independence of Sind, from the end of Aurangzeb's reign. Most of Balochistan came under the influence of the Khan of [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]], apart from some coastal areas such as [[Gwadar]], which were controlled by mutually competing and armed [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] trading companies.

The [[Sikh Empire]] (1799–1849) was formed on the foundations of the [[Punjab Army|Punjabi Army]] by [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] who was proclaimed &quot;''Sarkar-i-Khalsa''&quot;, and was referred to as the &quot;Maharaja of Lahore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;heath&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Ian|coauthors=Michael Perry|title=The Sikh army 1799–1849|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2005|location=Oxford|page=3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YIh9eQlojGsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+Sikh+Army+1799-1849|isbn=978-1-84176-777-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a collection of autonomous [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Misls]], which were governed by Misldars,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition 1911, p. 892&quot;&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, (Edition: Volume V22, Date: 1910–1911), p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in the [[Punjab region]]. The empire extended from the [[Khyber Pass]] in the west, to [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir|Kashmir]] in the north, to [[Multan]] in the south and [[Kapurthala]] in the east. The main geographical footprint of the empire was the [[Punjab region]]. The formation of the empire was a watershed and represented the resurgence of the local culture and power which had been subdued for hundreds of years by Afghan and Mughal rule.

The foundations of the Sikh Empire, during the time of the Punjabi Army, could be defined as early as 1707, starting from the death of [[Aurangzeb]]. The fall of the Mughal Empire provided opportunities for the Punjabi army to lead expeditions against the [[Mughals]] and [[Pashtuns]]. This led to a growth of the army, which was split into different Punjabi armies and then semi-independent &quot;misls&quot;. Each of these component armies were known as a [[misl]], each controlling different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762–1799, [[Sikh]] rulers of their misls appeared to be coming into their own. The formal start of the Sikh Empire began with the disbandment of the [[Punjab Army]] by the time of coronation of [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Ranjit Singh]] in 1801, creating a unified political state. All the misl leaders who were affiliated with the Army were nobility with usually long and prestigious family histories in Punjab's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition 1911, p. 892&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PYR_RAY/RANJIT_SINGH_MAHARAJA_178o_1839.html |title=MAHARAJAH RANJIT SINGH ... – Online Information article about MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH |publisher=Encyclopedia.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== British colony ==
The entire territory of modern Pakistan was occupied by the [[British East India Company]], then the [[British Empire]], through a series of wars, the main ones being the [[Battle of Miani]] (1843) in [[Sindh]], the gruelling [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]] (1845–1849) and the [[Anglo-Afghan War]]s (1839–1919), to remain a part of [[British Indian Empire]] until the freedom in 1947. The physical presence of the British was not very significant; they employed &quot;[[Divide and Rule]]&quot; [[political psychology|political]] [[strategy]] to remain in power. In his historical survey ''[[Constantine's Sword]]'', [[James P. Carroll]] writes: &quot;Certainly that was the story of the [[British Empire]]'s success, and its legacy of nurtured local hatreds can be seen wherever the [[Union Flag]] flew.&quot; .&lt;ref&gt;[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]], [[Constantine's Sword]], Mariner Books, 2002, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative units of [[British India]] under the [[tenancy]] or the [[sovereignty]] of either the [[East India Company]] or the [[The Crown|British Crown]] lasted between 1612 and 1947.

=== Early nationalism period ===
In 1877, [[Syed Ameer Ali]] had formed the ''Central National Muhammadan Association'' to work towards the political advancement of the Muslims, who had suffered grievously in 1857, in the aftermath of the failed [[Sepoy Mutiny]] against the [[British East India Company]]; the British were seen as foreign invaders. But the organization declined towards the end of the 19th century.

In 1885, the [[Indian National Congress]] was founded as a forum, which later became a party, to promote a nationalist cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandra|first=Bipan|coauthors=Amales Tripathi; Barun De|title=Freedom struggle|publisher=National Book Trust, India|year=1972|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Congress attempted to include the Muslim community in the struggle for independence from the [[British Raj|British rule]] - and some Muslims were very active in the Congress - the majority of Muslim leaders did not trust the party, viewing it as a &quot;[[Hinduism|Hindu]]-dominated&quot; organization.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;jaffrelot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe|title=A history of Pakistan and its origins|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2004|location=London|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Q9sI_Y2CKAcC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=A+History+Of+Pakistan+And+Its+Origins|isbn=978-1-84331-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Some Muslims felt that an independent united India would inevitably be &quot;ruled by Hindus&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and that there was a need to address the issue of the Muslim identity within India.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} A turning point in national amity came in 1900, when the British administration in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]] acceded to Hindu demands and made [[Hindi]], written in the [[Devanagari]] script, the official language. The [[Shuddhi|proslytisation]] conducted in the region by the [[Swami Shraddhanand|activists]] of a new Hindu [[Arya Samaj|reformist movement]] also stirred Muslim's concerns about their faith. Eventually, the Muslims feared that the Hindu majority would seek to suppress Muslim culture and religion in the region of an independent [[Hindustan]].

=== The Muslim League ===
The [[All-India Muslim League]] was founded on 30 December 1906, in the aftermath of [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]], on the sidelines of the annual [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]] in [[Shahbagh]], [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jalal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|authorlink=Ayesha Jalal|title=The sole spokesman : Jinnah, the Muslim League, and the demand for Pakistan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|location=Cambridge (UK); New York|isbn=978-0-521-24462-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was attended by three thousand delegates and presided over by [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]]. It addressed the issue of safeguarding interests of Muslims and finalised a programme. A resolution, moved by [[Khwaja Salimullah|Nawab Salimullah]] and seconded by [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]]. Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk, declared:

{{quotation|The Musalmans are only a fifth in number as compared with the total population of the country, and it is manifest that if at any remote period the British government ceases to exist in India, then the rule of India would pass into the hands of that community which is nearly four times as large as ourselves&amp;nbsp;... our life, our property, our honour, and our faith will all be in great danger, when even now that a powerful British administration is protecting its subjects, we the Musalmans have to face most serious difficulties in safe-guarding our interests from the grasping hands of our neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;quaid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaid.gov.pk/politician2.htm|title=The Statesman: The All India Muslim League|publisher=Government of Pakistan|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The constitution and principles of the League were contained in the ''Green Book'', written by [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]]. Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state, but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim liberties and rights, promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians, educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government, and discouraging violence. However, several factors over the next thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the League's aims.&lt;ref name=&quot;talbot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Talbot|first=Ian|title=Pakistan: a modern history|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|location=New Delhi; New York|isbn=978-0-19-565073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blood&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blood|first=Peter R.|title=Pakistan: a country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year=1995|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=28–29|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DRMTO7mn7hIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Jinnah+1930|isbn=978-0-8444-0834-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those Muslims in the Congress who did not initially join the League was [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]], a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay. This was because the first article of the League's platform was &quot;To promote among the Mussalmans (Muslims) of India, feelings of loyalty to the British Government&quot;.

In 1907, a vocal group of Hindu hard-liners within the [[Indian National Congress]] movement separated from it and started to pursue a pro-Hindu movement openly. This group was spearheaded by the famous trio of [[Lal-Bal-Pal]] - [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] and [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] of Punjab, Bombay and Bengal provinces respectively. Their influence spread rapidly among other like minded Hindus - they called it [[Hindu nationalism]] - and it became a cause of serious concern for Muslims.
However, Jinnah did not join the League until 1913, when the party changed its platform to one of Indian independence, as a reaction against the British decision to reverse the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]], which the League regarded it as a betrayal of the Bengali Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;hkdr1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|coauthors=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|year=1986|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=300–312|isbn=978-0-389-20670-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After vociferous protests of the Hindu population and violence engineered by secret groups, such as [[Anushilan Samiti]] and its offshoot [[Jugantar]] of [[Aurobindo]] and his brother etc., the British had decided to reunite Bengal again. Till this stage, Jinnah believed in Mutual co-operation to achieve an independent, united 'India', although he argued that Muslims should be guaranteed one-third of the seats in any Indian Parliament.
[[File:Iqbal.jpg|thumb|left|Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal]]
The League gradually became the leading representative body of Indian Muslims. Jinnah became its president in 1916, and negotiated the [[Lucknow Pact]] with the Congress leader, [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], by which Congress conceded the principle of [[Indian Councils Act 1909|separate electorates]] and weighted representation for the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=&quot;hkdr2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|coauthors=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|year=1986|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=272–273|isbn=978-0-389-20670-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jinnah broke with the Congress in 1920 when the Congress leader, [[Mohandas Gandhi]], launched a law violating [[Non-Cooperation Movement]] against the British, which a temperamentally law abiding barrister Jinnah disapproved of. Jinnah also became convinced that the Congress would renounce its support for separate electorates for Muslims, which indeed it did in 1928. In 1927, the British proposed a constitution for India as recommended by the [[Simon Commission]], but they failed to reconcile all parties. The British then turned the matter over to the League and the Congress, and in 1928 an All-Parties Congress was convened in Delhi. The attempt failed, but two more conferences were held, and at the Bombay conference in May, it was agreed that a small committee should work on the constitution. The prominent Congress leader [[Motilal Nehru]] headed the committee, which included two Muslims, [[Syed Ali Imam]] and [[Shoaib Quereshi]]; Motilal's son, Pt [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was its secretary. The League, however, rejected the committee's report, the so-called [[Nehru Report]], arguing that its proposals gave too little representation (one quarter) to Muslims – the League had demanded at least one-third representation in the legislature. Jinnah announced a &quot;parting of the ways&quot; after reading the report, and relations between the Congress and the League began to sour.

=== Muslim homeland - &quot;Now or Never&quot; ===
{{main|Pakistan Declaration}}
The election of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1929 in Britain, already weakened by [[World War I]], fuelled new hopes for progress towards self-government in British-India. Gandhi travelled to London, claiming to represent all Indians and criticising the League as sectarian and divisive. [[Round Table Conference|Round-table talks]] were held, but these achieved little, since Gandhi and the League were unable to reach a compromise. The fall of the Labour government in 1931 ended this period of optimism. By 1930 Jinnah had despaired of Indian politics and particularly of getting mainstream parties like the Congress to be sensitive to minority priorities. A fresh call for a separate state was then made by the famous writer, poet and philosopher Allama [[Muhammad Iqbal]], who in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that he felt that a separate Muslim state was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated South Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;aips&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_iqbal_1930.html|title=Sir Muhammad Iqbal's 1930 Presidential Address|work=Speeches, Writings, and Statements of Iqbal|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;critique&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mir|first=Mustansir|title=Iqbal|publisher=I.

After the elections the League took office in Bengal and Punjab, but the Congress won office in most of the other provinces, and refused to devolve power with the League in provinces with large Muslim minorities citing technical difficulties.

Meanwhile, Muslim ideologues for independence also felt vindicated by the presidential address of [[V.D. Savarkar]] at the 19th session of the famous Hindu nationalist party [[Hindu Mahasabha]] in 1937. In it, this legendary revolutionary - popularly called [[Veer Savarkar]] and known as the iconic father of the Hindu fundamentalist ideology - propounded the seminal ideas of his [[Two Nation Theory]] or ethnic exclusivism, which influenced Jinnah profoundly.

[[File:Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman.jpg|thumb|Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman seconding the Resolution with Jinnah presiding the session]]
In 1940, Jinnah called a general session of the Muslim League in [[Lahore]] to discuss the situation that had arisen due to the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the Government of India joining the war without consulting Indian leaders. The meeting was also aimed at analyzing the reasons that led to the defeat of the Muslim League in the general election of 1937 in the Muslim majority provinces. In his speech, Jinnah criticized the [[Indian National Congress]] and the nationalists, and espoused the [[Two-Nation Theory]] and the reasons for the demand for separate homelands.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolpert&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley A.|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert|title=Jinnah of Pakistan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-503412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)|Sikandar Hayat Khan]], the Chief Minister of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], drafted the original resolution, but disavowed the final version,&lt;ref name=&quot;tinker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tinker|first=Hugh|title=Men who overturned empires : fighters, dreamers, and schemers|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1987|location=Madison|page=50|isbn=978-0-299-11460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had emerged after protracted redrafting by the Subject Committee of the Muslim League.

[[World War II]] had broken the back of both [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] and disintegration of their colonial empires was expected soon.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Rebellions and protest against the British had increased. With the election of another sympathetic [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] in Britain in 1945, Indians were seeing independence within reach. But, Gandhi and Nehru were not receptive to Jinnah's proposal and were also adamantly opposed to dividing India, since they knew that the Hindus, who saw India as one indivisible entity, would never agree to such a thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;hkdr1&quot; /&gt; In the [[Constituent Assembly]] elections of 1946, the League won 425 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (polling 89.2% of total votes) on a policy of creating an independent state of Pakistan, and with an implied threat of secession if this was not granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;hkdr1&quot; /&gt; By 1946 the British had neither the will, nor the financial resources or military power, to hold India any longer. Political deadlock ensued in the Constituent Assembly, and the British Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|cabinet mission]] to India to mediate the situation. When the talks broke down, Attlee appointed [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] as India's last viceroy, to negotiate the independence of Pakistan and India and immediate British withdrawal. Mountbatten, of imperial blood and a world war admiral, handled the problem as a campaign. Ignorant of the complex ground realities in British India,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} he brought forward the date of transfer of power and told Gandhi and Nehru that if they did not accept division there would be civil war in his opinion&lt;ref name=&quot;hkdr1&quot; /&gt; and he would rather consider handing over power to individual provinces and the rulers of princely states. This forced the hands of Congress leaders and the &quot;Independence of India Act 1947&quot; provided for the two dominions of Pakistan and India to become independent on the 14 and 15 August 1947 respectively. This result was despite the calls for a third [[Osmanistan]] in the early 1940s.

On 14 and 15 August 1947, [[British India]] gave way to two new independent states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] and the [[Union of India]], both [[dominion]]s which joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. However, &lt;!-- the ill conceived and controversial [this appears to be the writer's personal opinion and cannot be allowed in a neutral document]--&gt; &lt;!-- (bitterly opposed by the League) --&gt; the decision to divide [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]], two of the biggest provinces, between India and Pakistan had disastrous consequences. This division created inter-religious violence of such magnitude that exchange of population along religious lines became a necessity in these provinces. More than two million people migrated across the new borders and more than one hundred thousand died in the spate of communal violence, that spread even beyond these provinces. The independence also resulted in tensions over [[Kashmir]] leading to the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], which culminated in an armistice, brokered by the [[United Nations]], and a hitherto unresolved [[Kashmir dispute]]. The post-independence political history of Pakistan has been characterised by several periods of authoritarian military rule and continuing territorial disputes with India over the status of Kashmir.

In 1947, after establishing the [[State of Pakistan]], the [[:Category:Leaders of the Pakistan Movement|Founding fathers]] of Pakistan appointed [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Lyakat Ali Khan]], a political theorist, as [[Prime minister of Pakistan|country's]] [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|first]] [[Head of government|Prime minister]]. The founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], was appointed as first [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] and the first [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan|President-Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Pakistan|State Parliament]]. 
[[File:Quaidportrait.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].]]
Initially, the state was composed of [[Provinces of Pakistan|five provinces]] ([[Sindh Province|Sindh]], [[Punjab Province (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Balochistan Province|Balochistan]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier]], and [[East Bengal|East-Bengal]]), and [[Administrative units of Pakistan|four administrative units]] ([[Gilgit–Baltistan]] (now a province), [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]] (also a provisional state), [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Tribal belt]] and [[Provincially Administered Tribal Areas|Local tribal belt]]), with Karachi being its first capital. The government of [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Lyakat Ali Khan]] suffered many problems and setbacks during the very first year of his government. In the west, [[Durand Line|territorial problems]] arose with neighboring communist states - [[Communist Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[Soviet Union]] - both states being hostile towards Pakistan. While the independence and establishment of Pakistan was not greatly welcomed by the Soviet Union, the countries of Iran and [[Israel]] (a secret courier) sent their diplomatic missions to the newly established state. In 1947, Iran became the first country to give recognition to Pakistan, while Israel was not given a complete response. Territorial problems escalated with India, later both nations declaring full-scale war against each other in 1947, which became to known as [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1947]], this was followed by [[Balochistan conflict|1948 Balochistan conflict]]. The problem of Hazara was a big issue which was resolved by Jalal ud din khan Jalal baba. He became &quot;Fateh Refrendum' and later served as Interior Minister of Pakistan.. 

[[File:Liaquat Ali Khan 140x190.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Liaquat Ali Khan|Lyakat Ali Khan]].]]
In 1948 at the [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliament]], [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] declared that &quot;Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan&quot;. This controversial statement sparked protests in East Bengal (later East Pakistan), where [[Bengali language|Bengali]] was spoken by most of the population. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] reached its peak on 21 February 1952, when the police and soldiers opened fire on students near the [[Dhaka Medical College]] protesting for Bengali to receive equal status with Urdu. Several protesters were killed, and the movement gained further support throughout East Pakistan. Later, the Government agreed to provide equal status to Bengali as a state language of Pakistan, a right codified in the 1956 constitution.

In 1953 at the instigation of religious parties, anti-[[Ahmadiyya]] riots erupted, killing scores of non-Ahmadis and destroying their properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;1953riots&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blood|first=Peter R.|title=Pakistan: a country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year=1995|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=130–131|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DRMTO7mn7hIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pakistan:+A+Country+Study|isbn=978-0-8444-0834-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riots were investigated by a two-member court of inquiry in 1954,&lt;ref name=&quot;munir&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Munir|first=Muhammad|authorlink=Muhammad Munir|coauthors=[[M.

In 1954, the legislative elections were held in Pakistan, the first legislative elections held since 1947. In 1955, Pakistan's western states and East Bengal were devolved into two single states by [[One Unit]] policy of [[Mohammad Ali Bogra]], establishing the states of West Pakistan and East Pakistan. The 1954 elections showed a clear differences in ideology, when East Pakistan fell under communism by the nexus of [[Communist Party of Pakistan|Communist Party]], [[Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal|Workers-Peasant Party]], allying with [[Awami League]]. [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]] gained majority seats in West - the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) only secured 10 seats in East and none in West. Awami League's [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Huseyn Suhrawardy]], one of the leading founding fathers of Pakistan, became the prime minister with communist-socialist alliance backing his policies. While the One Unit programme was a complete success in the East, the policy completely failed in the West, with nationalists in its provinces and their people forcefully rejecting the programme. Under pressure of protests, Prime minister Suhrawardy decided to retain the mild status of the provinces in 1955. After assuming the government, Suhrawardy decided to build a massive military and launched the plan of [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] in the West to keep his mandate in West Pakistan. Following this, the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] was established and the work on establishing Pakistan as a nuclear power was initiated personally by Suhrawardy. Suhrawardy suffered internal problems in West when capitalist forces - industrial monopolies, and capital economists - made their efforts to halt any policy evaluation process of economy of Pakistan for initiating complete nationalization, a centralised government economy. The human development in East got worsened and national security of Pakistan was put in great doubt. 
[[File:Mujib-Suhra.gif|left|200px|thumb|[[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Huseyn Suhrawardy]] (left).]]
Suharwarthy became the first Prime minister of Pakistan to visit [[People's Republic of China]] and attempted to improve relations with [[Soviet Union]]. However, despite his left-wing policies, Suhrawardy formulated pro-American policies. In 1954, after Suhrawardy's visit to Untied States, the United States government dispatched the [[Military Assistance Advisory Group|MAA Group]] for [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] which was met with great hostility in East Pakistan, while the move was widely appreciated and seen as positive in West. The [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly|East-Pakistan Parliament]] threatened to leave the federation of Pakistan, and denounced the United States' involvement. Controversially, prime minister Suhrawardy gave secret and verbal authorization of leasing the [[Peshawar Air Station|secret ISI installation]] to American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), to conduct intelligence operations in Soviet Union. Differences in East Pakistan on the United States' operations further encouraged the [[Baloch separatist|Baloch separatism]], leading president [[Iskandar Ali Mirza]] to initiate massive arrests of communists and workers of Awami League in East Pakistan, which damaged the image of West Pakistan in the East further. 

Egoistic problems grew between the two Bengali leaders - President Mirza and Prime minister Suhrawardy - further damaging the unity of the country. In 1956, President Mirza exerted a mounting pressure on Suhrawardy to resign from the prime minister's post. Suhrawardy's political might and control of Awami League was also challenged by [[Maulana Bhashani]] and Suhrawardy subsequently lost support in his party. Isolated and disheartened, Suhrwardy resigned and withdrew his public mandate and was succeeded by a close friend [[Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar]] as Prime minister.

[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Iskandar Mirza]].]]
The Dominion status of the country was dissolved on 23 March 1956 and  Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]], with the last [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]], [[Iskandar Mirza]], as the first president as well as first Bengali leader of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;republic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blood|first=Peter R.|title=Pakistan: a country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year=1995|location=Washington, D.C.|page=41|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DRMTO7mn7hIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pakistan:+A+Country+Study|isbn=978-0-8444-0834-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two years later, the military would take control of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;1958coup&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapur|first=Ashok|title=Pakistan in crisis|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|location=London; New York|page=70|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qb4YVNs-9XwC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Pakistan+in+crisis|isbn=978-0-415-00062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the imposition of One Unit policy, two states had been established - the state of [[West Pakistan]] (consisting four provinces) and the state of East Pakistan (one single state). The two states had one president and one prime minister, both exclusively headquartered in West. After the 1954 elections, the problems began to mount between West and East Pakistan - West decided to follow the [[Western democracy|Westernized]] [[Parliamentary form of government|Parliamentary form]] of the democracy while East chose to became a socialist state. Within two month, Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar|I.I. Chundrigar]] was dismissed; followed by [[Feroz Khan Noon|Sir Feroz Noon]], who proved to be an incapable prime minister. 

The [[Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) began to rise after the 1954 elections, which threatened the power of President Mirza. During this time of less than two years, President Mirza had dismissed four prime ministers - one from AL and three from Republican party - and finally imposed the first martial law in 1958, after suspending the constitution: Having suspended the constitution, and dissolving the socialist government in East first and then the parliamentary government in West, President Mirza appointed [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army commander]] General Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) to enforce the martial law. However, after developing serious differences with the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], President Mirza himself remained in office only for two months; two week after imposing the martial law, [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] self-appointed himself to the rank of a five star Field Marshal and named a new civil-military government under him.&lt;ref name=&quot;basic&quot;/&gt;

====Presidential republic (1962–1969)====

[[File:Muhammad Ayub Khan.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Muhammad Ayub Khan]].]]
This period existed from 1962 until 1969 - when Ayub Khan became president and began a new system of government called ''Basic Democracy'' with a new [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|1962 constitution]],&lt;ref name=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahmood|first=Shaukat|title=The second Republic of Pakistan; an analytical and comparative evaluation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan|publisher=[[Ilmi Kitab Khana]]|year=1966|location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which an electoral college of 80,000 would select the President - the country became a [[presidential republic]] with Ayub Khan its president. During Ayub's rule, relations with the [[United States]] and other Western nations grew stronger. Pakistan joined two formal military alliances — the Baghdad Pact (later known as the [[Central Treaty Organization]] or CENTO) which included Iran, Iraq, and Turkey to ostensibly defend the Middle East and Persian Gulf against the Soviet Union;&lt;ref name=&quot;cento&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Peaslee|first=Amos J.|coauthors=Dorothy Peaslee Xydis|title=International governmental organizations|publisher=Nijhoff|year=1974|location=The Hague|page=266|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8U65llhfqSwC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=Central+Treaty+Organization|isbn=978-90-247-1601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) which covered South-East Asia against the communist block.&lt;ref name=&quot;seato&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarling|first=Nicholas|title=The Cambridge history of Southeast Asia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|location=Cambridge, UK; New York, N.Y.|page=603|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pBfsaw64rjMC&amp;pg=PA603&amp;dq=South+East+Asia+Treaty+Organization|isbn=978-0-521-35505-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States dismayed Pakistan by adopting a policy of denying military aid to both India and Pakistan during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] over Kashmir and the [[Rann of Kutch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1965war&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tahir-Kheli|first=Shirin|title=India, Pakistan, and the United States : breaking with the past|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1997|location=New York|pages=35–36|url=http://books.google.com/?id=srCLD-PXl-gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=India,+Pakistan,+and+the+United+States:+Breaking+with+the+Past| isbn=978-0-87609-199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive gain of the treaties was the re-strengthening of Pakistan's close historical bonds with its western neighbors in Asia.

In West Pakistan alone, the economy, educational efforts, human development and  scientific research reached a new high level during this time, gaining international recognition for the country. Abdus Salam and Munir Ahmad Khan in [[IAEA]] made tremendous effort with [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s support, to put Pakistan on the nuclear power road. In 1965, a pact for establishing country's first nuclear power plant was signed with [[General Electric Canada|GE Canada]], and for establishing a nuclear processing sites with [[British Nuclear Fuels|BNFL plc. ltd.]] of [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] of France. During this period, [[United States]] established a nuclear fission reactor [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-I Reactor|''PARR-I'']] and a nuclear fusion facility, [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#Fast-Neutron Generator|Fusion Fast Laboratories]] all in West Pakistan. As a spin off to the nuclear projects, a space programme was also launched by Abdus Salam with the help of United States and Pakistan established the authority [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]] (SRC) in 1961. In 1962, the space launching center— [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Sonmiani Terminal]] was built in Karachi. On 7 June 1961, a two-stage solid fuel rocket, [[Rehbar-I|''Rehbar-I'']] was launched, making Pakistan the third country in Asia and the tenth in the world to conduct such a launching. While in West the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] was putting efforts for a massive scientific and technological development, it was supervising small academic research in East. No nuclear facilities were ever established in East Pakistan, nor any Western interest was there to established the nuclear facilities in East. Amidst further allegations that economic development and hiring for government jobs favoured West Pakistan, there was a rise in Bengali nationalism during the 1960s and an independence movement began to gather ground in East Pakistan.

President Ayub Khan had almost lost the controversial [[Pakistani presidential election, 1965|1965 presidential elections]] to [[Fatima Jinnah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1965election&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakhi|first=M. V.|coauthors=Virendra Narain; Kashi Prasad Misra|title=Presidential election in Pakistan: 1965|publisher=University of Rajasthan|year=1965|location=Jaipur}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, after Pakistan went ahead with its strategic air-borne mission code named the [[Operation Gibraltar|''Operation Gibraltar'']], [[India]] declared a full-scale war on Pakistan. The war, which ended militarily in a stalemate, was mostly fought in West as only mild operations were conducted in East by India. Controversially, [[East Pakistan Rifles|East-Pakistan Army]] did not interfere in the conflict that brought a great ire in West against East. Subsequently, the [[Tashkent Agreement]] was signed between India and Pakistan under the auspices of Soviet Union. Later, while defending Pakistan's position at the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1965, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto delivered a blistering speech; with the atomic scientist [[Aziz Ahmed]] present there for good measure, Bhutto made Pakistan's intentions clear and loudly announced that: &quot;If India builds the (nuclear) bomb, we will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of own&amp;nbsp;... We have no other choice&quot;.

Disagreeing with the signing of Tashkent agreement, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] resigned from his ministry. After news flooded in West, spontaneous mass demonstrations were held, major industrial and labor strikes began to take place and within months Ayub Khan lost control of West. Ayub Khan's popularity waned and his image was maligned by the opposition. In 1967, Bhutto called for a public meeting of socialists and left-wing intellectuals in Lahore and founded the leading leftist party, the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP).

The PPP at once gained popularity and wide scale public approval of Bhutto, who tapped a wave of anger against Ayub Khan. After facing the intense public resentment and pressure of scheming Bhutto, Ayub Khan left the office in poor health and surrendered powers to his army commander, a less-known in public and heavy alcohol drinker, General [[Yahya Khan]], who imposed  martial law and suspended the constitution, thus dissolving the presidential republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;basic&quot;/&gt;

====Martial law in Pakistan (1969–1971)====

After [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan|nationwide uprising]] in 1969, President [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] had stepped down from office, handing over power to army commader General [[Yahya Khan]], who promised to hold general elections at the end of 1970. However, his martial law in Pakistan would remain from 1969–71, in which time only military government ruled with high-profile joint military officers occupying government assignments. During this time, the rise of [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialism]] began to take place with Pakistan People's Party being the central party. The PPP's socialist rationale, &quot;[[Roti Kapda Aur Makaan|''Food, Cloth, and Shelter'']] and party's manifesto quickly popularized the party and in a small span of time, it became the major party in the West. 
[[File:Yahya and Nixon.jpg|left|thumb|230px|General Yahya Khan (left).]] In 1970, major land reforms were carried out by General Yahya Khan and a series of geographical and territorial changes in West alone. General Yahya Khan issued the presidential decree, the [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|LFO Order No. 1970]], dissolving the One Unit status of West Pakistan, by simply adding Pakistan: the structure, territorial pictures, borders and geographical positions of [[Province of Pakistan|provinces of Pakistan]] were retained, but the former structure of the [[Province of Pakistan|four provinces]] of Pakistan was restored - Sindh; Punjab; Balochistan; NWFP now renamed [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The provincial assemblies and provincial positions also were restored. The state parliament, supreme court and major government and authoritarian institutions also regained their status. This decree was only limited to West, it had no effects on East. 

On the eve of the elections, a [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] struck East Pakistan killing approximately 500,000 people. Despite the tragedy and the additional difficulty experienced by affected citizens in reaching the voting sites, Pakistan's [[Pakistani general election, 1970|first ever democratic elections]] were held. The East Pakistan [[Awami League]] won the elections. The results, however, showed a clear division between East and West Pakistan. The [[Awami League]], led by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], won a majority with 167 of the 169 East Pakistani seats, but with no seats in West Pakistan, where the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], won 85 seats, none in East Pakistan. Consequently, General Yahya Khan proposed to appoint [[Nurul Amin]] - a Bengali figure and chairman of [[Pakistan Muslim League-N|Pakistan Muslim League]] - as the prime minister as well as country's first [[Vice President of Pakistan]], while appointing Bhutto as deputy prime minister and Mujib as vice-prime minister; this scheme was forcefully rejected by Bhutto. Eventually, under Bhutto's pressure, Yahya Khan refused to hand over power to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
[[File:8 Nurul Amin.jpg|right|thumb|900px|[[Nurul Amin]].]]

Meanwhile, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman initiated a [[civil disobedience]] movement, which was strongly supported by the general population of East Pakistan, including most government workers. A round-table conference between Yahya, Bhutto, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was convened in [[Dhaka]], which, however, ended without a solution. Soon thereafter, the Pakistan Armed Forces commenced [[Operation Searchlight]] (as followed by [[Operation Barisal]] by [[Pakistan Navy]]), an organized crackdown on the East Pakistani army, police, politicians, civilians, and students in Dhaka. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and many other Awami League leaders were arrested, while others fled to neighbouring India. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was taken to West Pakistan. The crackdown widened and escalated into a [[Bangladesh Liberation War|guerrilla warfare]] between the Pakistan Armed Forces and the [[Mukti Bahini]] (Bengali &quot;freedom fighters&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwar&quot; &gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm|title=The 1971 war|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of Hindus and Bengals fled to India. In March 1971, India's [[Indira Gandhi|Prime Minister]] announced support for the Bengalis' Liberation War, providing direct 'military assistance'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bangladesh Liberation War]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power by [[Tariq Ali]] 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 1971, Major [[Ziaur Rahman]], a Bengali war-veteran of the [[East Bengal Regiment]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], declared the independence of East Pakistan as the new nation of [[Bangladesh]] on behalf of Mujib. 

Following a period of [[Research and Analysis Wing|covert]] and overt intervention by [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian forces]] in the conflict, [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|open hostilities]] broke out between India and Pakistan on 3 December 1971. In Bangladesh, the Pakistan Armed Forces led by General [[A. A. K. Niazi|Amir Niazi]] and Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff|Shariff]], had already been weakened and exhausted by the Mukti Bahini's guerrilla warfare. Outflanked and overwhelmed, the Pakistan armed forces in the eastern theatre surrendered on 16 December 1971, with nearly 90,000 soldiers taken as prisoners of war. The result was the defacto emergence of the new nation of Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=&quot;uscsbn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm|title=The War for Bangladeshi Independence, 1971|work=Country Studies|publisher=U. S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus ending 24 years of turbulent union of the two wings. The figures of the Bengali civilian death toll from the entire civil war vary greatly, depending on the sources. Although the killing of Bengalis was unsupported by the people of West Pakistan, it continued for 9 months. Pakistan's official report, by the [[Hamood-ur-Rahman Commission]], placed the figure at only 26,000, while estimates range up to 3 million. Discredited by the defeat, General Yahya Khan resigned and Bhutto was inaugurated as president and chief martial law administrator on 20 December 1971.

=== Second democratic era (1971–1977) ===

[[File:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].]]
The nation was demoralized after the war and calls for a change from the military rule began to rise. Civilian rule and democracy returned, when General Yahya Khan handed over the [[Power (politics)|political power]] to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]. Bhutto dismissed chiefs of [[Gul Hassan Khan|army]], [[Muzaffar Hassan|navy]] and the [[Abdul Rahim Khan|air force]] while authorized [[house arrest|home confinement]] orders for General [[Yahya Khan]] and several of his collaborators. He adopted the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission|East-Pakistan Commission]]'s recommendations and authorized large-scale court-martial of army officers tainted for their role in East Pakistan. To keep the country united, Bhutto launched a series of internal intelligence operations to crack down on the fissiparous nationalist sentiments and movements in the provinces. Pakistan People's Party and Zulfikar Bhutto faced serious challenges, both on internal and foreign fronts.

From 1971 till 1977 was a period of growth of [[Nationalism in Pakistan|national spirit]], [[nationalization]] of economy, atomic bomb projects and [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing socialism]]. It is regarded as the period of reconstruction, rehabilitation, and re-establishment of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; In 1972, the country's top [[Pakistani intelligence|intelligence services]] learned that &quot;India was close to developing a nuclear weapon under its [[Indian nuclear programme|nuclear programme]]&quot;. In response, Bhutto called a secret meeting, which came to be known as &quot;Multan meeting&quot;, aimed to rally academic scientists to build the atomic bomb for national survival. The [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb project]] brought together a team of prominent academic scientists and engineers, headed by nuclear physicist [[Abdus Salam]] to develop nuclear devices. Salam later won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for developing the theory for unification of weak nuclear forces and strong electromagnetic forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas C. Reed]] and Danny B. Stillman, ''The nuclear express: a political history of the bomb and its proliferation'' (2009) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a serious nationalist rebellion also took place in Balochistan province and led to harsh suppression of Baloch rebels with the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] purportedly assisting with air support in order to prevent the conflict from spilling over into [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Iranian Balochistan]]. The conflict ended later after an amnesty and subsequent stabilization by the provincial military ruler [[Rahimuddin Khan]]. In 1973, Parliament approved a [[Constitution of Pakistan|new constitution]], and Pakistan, for the first time, was declared a Parliamentary democracy. Bhutto and his government carried out major and serious reforms for establishment and development and re-designing of the country's infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; First and foremost, Bhutto supervised the successful promulgation of [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 constitution]] that validated the parliamentary democracy in the country. The establishment of [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (as well [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Joint Strategic Forces Command]]), reorganization of the [[Pakistan Military|military]], special forces and chain of commands in the military. Steps were taken for democratization of [[Civil Service of Pakistan|civil bureaucracy]], [[Election Commission of Pakistan|election commission]] and the [[Politics of Pakistan|political structure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; The government of People's Party took major steps for country's economic and human infrastructure growth, starting first with the [[Agriculture Of Pakistan|agriculture]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto#Land, flood and agriculture reforms|land reforms]], and [[Controlled economy|government control]] ([[nationalization]])of major [[List of industries in Pakistan|private industries]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto#Economic policy|industrialization]] and the expansion of the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|education system]] throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; In 1974, Bhutto succumbed to increasing pressure from religious parties and helped Parliament to declare the [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents as non-Muslims.

At foreign fronts, the [[Pakistan-United States relations|alliance]] with the [[United States]] weakened but, on the other hand, the [[Pakistan–Russia relations#Relations with Superpower: 1947-1991|relations with]] [[Soviet Union]] and [[Soviet Bloc]] - [[North Korea-Pakistan relations|North Korea]], [[People's Republic of China - Pakistan relations|China]] - and the [[Arab-Pakistan relations|Arab world]] improved and strengthened.  In 1974, Pakistan was alarmed by the Indian nuclear test. Bhutto - as promised in 1965, &quot;If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass and leaves, even go hungry. But we will get one of our own, we have no alternative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hyman et al., ''Pakistan Zia and After'' (1990) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; - had started a strategic project in 1972. This project reached a milestone in 1978 when the desired level of production of fissile core material was reached as well as first design of [[physics package]]. (for more information and sources: see the operation codenamed &quot;[[Kirana-I|''Kirana-I'']]&quot; and the &quot;[[Kahuta Test|''Test Kahuta'']]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=PA WIKI|title=Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (much sources are cited there)|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z._A._Bhutto|publisher=Authorship personal recovery|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1974, Bhutto took aggressive measures against India in the [[United Nations]] and targeted its nuclear programme on multiple occasions that pushed India on the defensive, while Pakistan worked on its atomic bomb project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; From 1976 to 1977, Bhutto faced an intense and heated diplomatic war with the United States and President [[Jimmy Carter]], who worked covertly to damage the credibility of Bhutto in Pakistan. Bhutto, with his scientist colleague [[Aziz Ahmed]], thwarted any U.S. attempts to infiltrate the atomic bomb programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; In 1976, during a secret mission, [[Henry Kissinger]] threatened Bhutto and his colleague while used an inhumane language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; After the meeting, Bhutto aggressively put efforts to successfully developed the atomic project before the coming elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; 

As the country entered 1976, the socialist alliance of Bhutto collapse, forcing his left-wing allies to form an [[Pakistan National Alliance|alliance]] with right-wing conservatives, to challenge the power of Peoples Party. [[Pakistani general elections, 1977|Elections]] were held in 1977, which the Peoples Party won but this was challenged by the opposition, which accused Bhutto of rigging the election process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; An intensified [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto#Popular unrest and military coup|civil disorder]] took place against Bhutto and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] general [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], supported by [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|chief of naval staff]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]], took power in a bloodless coup (see [[Operation Fair Play|''Operation Fair Play'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt; Following this, Bhutto and his colleagues were dragged into a two-year long [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto#Trial of the Prime Minister|controversial trial]] in [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]]. Bhutto was later executed in 1979, after being convicted of authorizing the murder of a political opponent, in a controversial 4–3 split decision by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Authorship personal recovery&quot;/&gt;

=== Second military era (1977–1988) ===

{{See also|Ordinance XX|Hudood Ordinance}}
This period of military rule, lasting from 1977 to 1988, is often regarded as a period of [[Zia ul Haq and persecution|great purge]] and growth of state-sponsored [[Islamic conservatism|religious conservatism]]. General Zia-ul-Haq's long eleven-year-rule era features the country's first [[Technocracy]] and had no politicians from any parties in his government. His government employed professionals, scientists, engineers, medical researchers, military officers and also religious scholars. [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|General Zia-ul-Haq]] installed high-profile military officers of [[Pakistan Armed Forces|joint forces]] in civilian posts, ranging from central government to provisional governments.

Gradually, the socialist policies of the previous government were disbanded. Instead, a new system of [[capitalism]] was put in place under which industries and economic infrastructure were [[Privitisation|privatized]] ([[Denationalization|denationalized]]), and steps were taken to [[Deregulation|deregulate]] the market-economy of the country. The front formed against Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto split, with far right-wing conservatives allying with General Zia's government and encouraging the military government crack down on the left-wing elements in the country. The [[Movement for Restoration of Democracy|left-wing alliance]] led by [[Benazir Bhutto]] was brutalized by Zia who took every mean of aggressive measures against the movement. Further, in his time, cesessionist uprisings in Balochistan were put down successfully by the provincial governor, General [[Rahimuddin Khan]].
  
In 1984, Zia held a [[Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum, 1984|referendum]] asking the civil society for the support of his religious programme that received overwhelming support and extended the term of General Zia as country's administrator for next five years. He then introduced strict [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1978, often cited as the contributing factor in the present climate of [[sectarianism]] and [[religious fundamentalism]] in Pakistan. General Zia's government disbanded the Western styled songs, only patriotic songs were allowed in national television. [[Ordinance XX]] was introduced to limit the Ahmadis from misrepresenting themselves as Muslims. 
[[File:General Shamim Alam Khan receiving the Hilal-i-Imtiaz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|General Zia-ul-Haq (right).]]

After assuming power, Zia's government revived the old foreign policy and worked through to make a near-alliance with the [[United States]] and the [[Western world]]. In the 1980s, Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|intervened]] in Afghanistan. It helped Zia's government to make an alliance against Soviet Union and communism, covertly supporting U.S. scheme and agenda in Afghanistan. The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration in the [[United States]] helped supply and finance an anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan, using Pakistan as a conduit. As the front-line state in the anti-Soviet struggle, Pakistan received substantial aid from the United States as it took in millions of [[Afghan people|Afghan]] (mostly Pashtun) [[refugee]]s fleeing the Soviet occupation. The influx of so many refugees - the largest refugee population in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;aifa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA110161999|title=Refugees from Afghanistan: The world's largest single refugee group|publisher=Amnesty International|date=1 November 1999|accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019042601/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA110161999 |archivedate =2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; - had a heavy impact on Pakistan and its effects continue to this day. The religiously far-right parties - that remained at the [[Local government in Pakistan|Local government level]] - were instrumental in sending young students of clerical schools in their designated areas of responsibility and districts to participate in Soviet war in Afghanistan. In retaliation, the Afghan secret police, [[KHAD]], carried out a large number of terrorist operations against Pakistan, which also suffered from an influx of illegal weapons and drugs from Afghanistan.

Problems with India rose up when India [[Operation Meghdoot|attacked and took]] the [[Siachen glacier]], prompting Pakistan to strike back at India. The Indian Army were pushed back by Pakistan Army, leading Indian Army to formalize a controversial military exercise (See [[Operation Brasstacks]], summoning up to 400,000 troops near [[Sindh|Southern Pakistan]]. However, General Zia used the [[Cricket diplomacy]] to lessen the tensions between two countries but reportedly threatened India by adding to [[Rajiv Gandhi]]: &quot;If your [[Indian Armed Forces|[forces] ]] crossed our border an inch&amp;nbsp;... We are going to annihilate your (cities)...&quot;. 

General Zia finally lifted martial law in 1985, holding [[Pakistani general elections, 1985|non-partisan elections]] and handpicking [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]] to be the new Prime Minister, who readily extended Zia's term as Chief of Army Staff until 1990. Junejo however gradually fell out with Zia as his administrative independence grew; for instance, Junejo signed the Geneva Accord, which Zia greatly frowned upon. As retaliation, a controversy was planned after a large-scale blast at a munitions dump in Ojhri (see [[Ojhri Camp disaster]]), Prime minister Junejo vowed to bring to justice those responsible for the significant damage caused, implicating several senior generals. In return, General Zia dismissed the Junejo government on several charges in May 1988 and called for elections in November 1988. However, before the elections could ever take place, General Zia died in a mysterious plane crash on 17 August 1988 (See [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq]]).

=== Third democratic era (1988–1999): Benazir-Nawaz period ===

Democracy returned again in 1988 after the [[Pakistani general elections, 1988|general elections]] which were held after the death of General Zia-ul-Haq. The general elections saw the victory and return of Peoples Party back into the [[Power (politics)|power politics]]. This period, lasting until 1999, introduced the parliamentary system and [[Two-party system|two-party democracy]] in the country, featuring a fierce competition between [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|centre-right conservatives]] led by [[Nawaz Sharif|Navaz Sharif]] and [[Pakistan People's Party|centre-left socialists]] directed by [[Benazir Bhutto]]. The [[Communist Party of Pakistan|far-left politics]] and the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|far-right politics]] had disintegrated from the political arena with the [[Fall of communism|fall of global communism]] and the United States lessening its interests in Pakistan. Pakistan was ruled by elected civilian governments, alternately headed by [[Benazir Bhutto]] and [[Nawaz Sharif]], who were each elected twice and removed from office on charges of corruption and issues regarding the national security.

[[File:Benazir Bhutto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Benazir Bhutto]], 2004.]]
As a result of 1988 elections, [[Benazir Bhutto]] became the first female prime minister of Pakistan and the first female head of government in a Muslim majority country. At first, Prime minister Benazir Bhutto adopted pro-American policies and supervised the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|troop evacuation]] of Soviet Union from [[Communist Afghanistan]]. After Soviet withdrawal, the alliance with U.S. came to end -  when the secret of a successful clandestine [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb project]] was revealed to world, it led to imposition of economic sanctions by U.S. (see [[Pressler amendment]]). Benazir Bhutto responded aggressively after hearing the news of sanctions and relations with U.S. became cold. In 1989, she ordered a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)|military action]] in Afghanistan that brutally failed, leading her to depose the directors of the intelligence services. Also, economic situation in the country got worsened and the [[Pakistan Rupee|currency]] of Pakistan lost the [[currency war]] with India. Poor economic situation and national security concerns led the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's first government by the conservative President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]].

The new [[Pakistani general election, 1990|elections were held]] in 1990 and saw the success of centrist and right-wing conservative alliance, the [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA)]] led by Nawaz Sharif. The conservatives, for the first time in history, came to power under a democratic system under which Nawaz Sharif was appointed the Prime minister. Nawaz Sharif and conservatives inherited economic challenges and issues regarding internal security.
[[File:Nawaz Sharif profile.jpg|thumb|Nawaz Sharif, 1998]]
In November 1990, Sharif made a secret visit to U.S. and adopted a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]]; he announced that &quot;Pakistan doesn't possess an atomic bomb&quot; but vowed to develop nuclear power for economic reasons. Sharif launched a large-scale [[Nawaz Sharif#Industrialization|industrialization programme]] on the capitalist model. When he controversially ordered an operation against the liberals (the [[MQM]]) in Karachi (see [[Operation Blue Fox|Operation Blue-Fox]]), it led to the halt of his policies. Institutional problems arose with president Ghulam Khan, who attempted to dismiss Sharif on the same charges as he had pressed on Benazir Bhutto. Prime minister Sharif turned to Supreme Court that reconstituted his government. Sharif and Benazir Bhutto allied together to force President Ishaq Khan to resign from presidency but, Sharif too was forced to relinquish office later in weeks. 

Upon Sharif's resignation, the new [[Pakistani general election, 1993|elections were held]] in 1993 which saw the return of Benazir Bhutto and the Peoples Party for the third time. After securing the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]], Benazir Bhutto formed the government and appointed a hand-picked president for the presidential office and a new cabinet. Then, starting with the military forces, all four-star chiefs of [[Mansurul Haq|navy]], [[Abbas Khattak|air force]], [[Abdul Waheed|army]] and [[Farooq Feroze Khan|chairman joint chiefs]] were handpicked.  The internal policies were exercised on tough stance to bring peace in the country, starting first in Karachi and later in [[NWFP (Pakistan)|western Pakistan]]. She launched the [[Integrated Missile Research and Development Programme|integrated space weapons programme]] in 1993, supervising the construction of [[Shaheen-I|Shaheen]] and [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri systems]]. The military reforms and development programmes were launched by Benazir Bhutto in 1994 when she succeeded the agreement of the technology transfer of [[Air-independent propulsion|AIP technology]]. She drove her economic policies on the model of [[social democracy]] - limited nationalization and [[deregulation]] of industries while disbanding the [[List of trade unions in Pakistan|labour unions]]; the economy was highly [[Centralized planning|centralized]] and the proponents of [[social democracy]] and [[Nationalism in Pakistan|national pride]] were supported at an extreme level. Her actions earned her a nickname &quot;[[Iron Lady]]&quot; by her rivals. During the late 1990s, Pakistan was one of three countries which recognized the [[Taliban]] government and Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] as the legitimate ruler of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;talib1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1549285.stm|title=Who are the Taleban?|publisher=BBC News|date=2 September 2006|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations were made of Pakistan and other countries providing economic and military aid to the group from 1994 as a part of supporting the anti-Soviet alliance. It is alleged that some post-invasion Taliban fighters were recruits drawn from Pakistan's [[madrassahs]]. 

Relations with India worsened in 1995 when Benazir Bhutto learned the news of Indian attempt to conduct nuclear tests for the second time. At multiple occasions, Benazir Bhutto aggressively attacked India and pushed India on to take defensive positions on its nuclear programme. Under her second term, the atomic bomb programme was aggressively pursued, modernized and expanded despite U.S. objections, even though she tried to normalize relations with the United States and other Western world and strengthened relations with [[socialist states]]. 
[[File:MMurtazaBhutto 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Murtaza Bhutto]].]]

However in 1996, the popularity of Benazir Bhutto waned after her husband became allegedly involved in the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]], Benazir Bhutto's younger brother. Many public figures and officials suspected even Benazir Bhutto's involvement in the murder, although there were no proves. In 1996, seven weeks passed this incident, Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed by her own hand-picked president on charges of Murtaza Bhutto's death. 

In the [[Pakistani general election, 1997|1997 election]] that returned Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister, conservatives received a heavy majority of the vote, obtaining enough seats in [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliament]] to change the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]], which Prime minister Sharif [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|amended]] to eliminate the formal [[checks and balances]] that restrained the Prime Minister's power. Institutional challenges to his authority - led by the civilian [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Farooq Leghari]], [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|chairman joint chiefs]] general [[Jehangir Karamat]], [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|chief of naval staff]] admiral [[Fasih Bokhari]]e, and [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] - were put down and all four were forced to resign; Chief Justice Shah doing so after the Supreme Court was stormed by Sharif partisans.&lt;ref name=&quot;court1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/34866.stm|title=Protesters halt Pakistani PM court case|publisher=BBC News|date=28 November 1997|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with India further escalated in 1998, when the [[Media of Pakistan|television media]] reported the Indian nuclear explosions. It was the second nuclear test, codename [[Pokhran-II|''Operation Shakti'']], conducted by India since 1974 and with it India declared itself a nuclear power. When news flooded in Pakistan, a shocked Sharif called for a [[National Security Council of Pakistan|national security meeting]] in Islamabad and vowed that &quot;she (Pakistan) would give a suitable reply to the Indians&amp;nbsp;...&quot;. After reviewing the effects of tests for roughly two weeks, Sharif ordered [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] to perform a series of nuclear tests at the remote area of [[Chagai Hills]] in 1998 itself. The military forces in the country were mobilize at a war-situation level on Indian border.

Internationally condemned, but extremely popular at home, Sharif took extensive controls in his hands, to protect economic assets of the country, starting from [[Centralized planning|centralizing the economy]]. Sharif ordered to mobilize all the defence assets of Pakistan and closed all airspace routes by giving red-alerts orders to [[PAF]] and [[Pakistan Navy]]. Sharif responded fiercely, and defused the international pressure by targeting India for global [[nuclear proliferation]] while gave [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|great criticism]] to the United States for [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] on [[Japan]]ese cities of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]:

Without any exception, Sharif's popularity heightened up, a wide scale approval for his decision by the civil society which strengthened his public mandate. Under Nawaz Sharif's leadership, Pakistan became the seventh nuclear power country, the first country in the Muslim world, as well as a declared nuclear-weapon state. The conservative government also adopted environmental policies after establishing the [[Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection agency]]. 

However this political achievement was short-lived. Economic growth declined towards the end of nineties period, hurt by the Asian financial crisis and [[economic sanctions]] imposed on Pakistan after its first tests of nuclear devices in 1998, shortly after India tested its nuclear devices. The next year, Kargil attack by Pakistan backed Kashmiri militants threatened to escalate to a full-scale war&lt;ref name=&quot;kargil&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/352995.stm|title=India launches Kashmir air attack|publisher=BBC News|date=26 May 1999|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased fears of a nuclear war in South Asia. When this strategic infiltration led by Sharif's appointed [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman joint chiefs]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]] brutally failed, it led to an undeclared but full-scale war with India in 1999 (see [[Kargil war]]). Internationally condemned, the Kargil war came on a bad juncture for the prime minister and was followed by [[Atlantique Incident]] also in 1999. Sharif's mandate had no longer a hold on the country as the public support for him had collapsed.

On 12 October 1999, Prime minister Sharif attempted to dismiss [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|chairman joint chiefs]] and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]] and install [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) director Ziauddin Butt in his place, but senior military leadership refused to accept the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999coupbbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/472511.stm|title=Pakistan army seizes power|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-10-12|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musharraf, who was out of the country, boarded a commercial airliner to return to Pakistan. Sharif ordered the [[Jinnah International Airport|Jinnah Terminal]] to prevent the landing of the airliner, which then circled the skies over Karachi.

In Islamabad, the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police|Military Police]] seized the Prime Minister's Secretariat and led the arrest of the Prime Minister, Lieutenant-General Butt and those members of his cabinet who took part in this assumed conspiracy  and placed him in infamous [[Adiala Jail]]. The trial was set in [[Supreme Court]], which Sharif was forced to face and he received a lengthy life sentence, with his assets being frozen based on a corruption scandal, and he was near receiving the death sentence based on the hijacking case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford University Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Aziz|first=Sartaj|title=Between Dreams and Realities: Some Milestones in Pakistan’s History|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi, Pakistan|isbn=978-0-19-547718-4|pages=408|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\08\09\story_9-8-2009_pg3_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, the Supreme Court of Pakistan would acquit Nawaz Sharif from the hijacking scandal.&lt;sup&gt;[Ref' needed]&lt;/sup&gt; 

{{Rquote|left|It came to the conclusion that in relieving General Jehangir Karamat, Prime minister Sharif had committed a &quot;blunder&quot;. He also failed to recognize that despite his heavy mandate, it was not advisable for him to dismiss two army chiefs and one naval chief in less than a year. In doing so he had overplayed his hands and effectively derailed the democratic process for nine long year&amp;nbsp;...|Sartaj Aziz, 2009|&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford University Press&quot;/&gt;}}

The American President [[Bill Clinton]] - who had felt that his pressure to force Sharif to withdraw Pakistan forces from Kargil, in Indian-controlled Kashmir, was one of the main reasons for disagreements between Sharif and the Pakistan Armed Forces - and [[King Fahd]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] pressured General Musharraf to spare the life of Sharif and, instead, exile him to Saudi Arabia, guaranteeing that he would not be involved in politics for ten years. In an agreement facilitated by Saudi Arabia, Nawaz Sharif was exiled and lived in Saudi Arabia for more than six years before moving to London in 2005.

On assuming power, the first initiatives Musharraf took were the economic reforms and economic liberalization. During his personal trip to United States in 1999, he requested [[Shaukat Aziz]], a close ally and friend and former executive vice president of [[Citi Bank]], to take charge of [[Ministry of Finance (Pakistan)|Finance]], [[Statistics Division of the Government of Pakistan|Statistics]], and the [[Economic Coordination Committee|Economic ministry]], hence the control over the economy of the country.

On 12 May 2000 the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ordered the Government to hold general elections by 12 October 2002.

However, parties opposed to the Legal Framework Order effectively paralyzed the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] for over a year. The deadlock ended in December 2003, when Musharraf and some of his parliamentary opponents agreed upon a compromise, and pro-Musharraf legislators were able to muster the two-thirds majority required to pass the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Seventeenth Amendment]], which retroactively legitimized Musharraf's 1999 coup and many of his subsequent decrees. The amendment devolved the parliamentary republic and parliamentary democracy in the country, instead replacing with [[Semi-presidential system]]. In a [[vote of confidence]] on 1 January 2004, Musharraf won 658 out of 1,170 votes in the [[Electoral College of Pakistan]], and according to Article 41(8) of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], was elected to the office of President.&lt;ref name=&quot;article41&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html|title=The President of the Federation of Pakistan|publisher=Pakistani.org|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;br /&gt;linked from {{cite web|url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/constitution_pakistan.aspx|title=Text of the Constitution of Pakistan|publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of Pakistan|accessdate=2007-12-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109103454/http://www.infopak.gov.pk/constitution_pakistan.aspx |archivedate =2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his presidential election, Musharraf increased the role of [[Shaukat Aziz]] in PML-Q, and helped him to secure the party nomination for the office of Prime Minister. The Musharraf-Aziz regime featured the [[Semi-presidential system]].
[[File:PervezMusharraf.jpg|thumb|left|General Pervez Musharraf, [[Pakistan Army|PA]].]]
In 2004, Shaukat Aziz was elevated as Prime Minister of the country, initially charged with handling the day-to-day operations of government, overseeing the operational capabilities of military, energy and economic policies, and the improvisation of educational system while Musharraf took the control of foreign affairs, internal security, and his role in the American [[War on terror]]. While economic reforms undertaken during his regime yielded positive results, proposed social reforms were met with resistance. Musharraf faced opposition from religious groups who were angered by his post-[[9/11]] political alliance with the United States and his military support to the American led [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. He survived several assassination attempts by groups believed to be part of Al-Qaeda, including at least two instances where they had inside information from a member of his military security. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2001–04, the government of Musharraf suffered with various science-scandals which damaged the credibility of the country. In 2001, senior scientists [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood]] and [[Chaudhry Abdul Majeed|Abdul Majid]] were accused of aiding the terror organizations for the purposes of [[nuclear terrorism]]. However, the investigations revealed that none of the scientists were able to build the devices despite their academic/professional careers. Pakistan was also accused of contributing to global [[nuclear proliferation|atomic proliferation]]; its leading [[nuclear scientist]], Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], admitted to selling nuclear secrets, though he denied government knowledge of his activities. Later investigations exposed the beneficiary role of country's leading politicians leaving the world governments in shock, but they did not condemn any politicians due to pressure that it would harm their solidarity alliance with the country's political parties. 

At the same time, Pakistan continued to be involved in the [[Kashmir dispute|dispute]] over [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]], with allegations of support of separatist [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front|Kashmiri militants]] being leveled against Pakistan by [[India]]— which treats them as terror groups— while Pakistan levels charges that the Indian government abuses human rights in its excessive use of military force in the disputed region. What makes this dispute a source of special concern for the world community is that both India and Pakistan possess [[nuclear weapon]]s. It had led to a nuclear [[2001-2002 India-Pakistan standoff|standoff in 2002]], when Kashmir-militants, allegedly backed by the ISI, attacked the Indian parliament. In reaction to this, serious diplomatic tensions had developed and India and Pakistan deployed 500,000 and 120,000 troops to the border respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/kashmir-2002.htm|title=2002 - Kashmir Crisis|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Indo-Pakistani peace process made progress subsequently, it was sometimes stalled by infrequent insurgent activity in India, such as the [[26/11 Mumbai|26/11 Mumbai attacks]]. 

After the [[American invasion of Afghanistan|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], the Pakistan government, as an ally, deployed the [[XI Corps (Pakistan)|XI Corps]] with additional three combat mountaineering divisions under its Commander [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Ali Jan Aurakzai|Alijan Aurkzhai]] into the mountainous region of [[Waziristan]] in 2002, in search of [[Osama bin Laden]] (the master-mind behind the [[11 September attacks]] in 2001) and other heavily armed [[al-Qaeda]] members, who had taken refuge there. Deployment with [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] and [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]] support began conducting air and intelligence operations in 2002–03. Finally, in March 2004, heavy fighting broke out at Azam Warsak (near the South Waziristan town of Wana), between [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] and al-Qaeda militants (estimated to be 400 in number), who were entrenched in several fortified settlements. It was speculated that bin Laden's deputy [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] was among those trapped by the Pakistan Armed Forces. On 5 September 2006 a truce was signed with the militants and their local rebel supporters, (who called themselves the [[Islamic Emirate of Waziristan]]), in which the rebels were to cease supporting the militants in cross-border attacks on Afghanistan in return for a ceasefire and general amnesty and a hand-over of border-patrolling and check-point responsibilities, till then handled by the [[Pakistan Army]].

On 7 August, a policy deadlock between ruling parties ended, when the coalition government of Pakistan decided to move for the impeachment of the President before heading for the restoration of the deposed judiciary. Moreover, they decided that Pervez Musharraf should face charges of weakening Pakistan's federal structure, violating its constitution and creating economic impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredprnews.com/2008/08/08/pakistan-president-impeached_20080808565.html |title=Breaking News: Pakistan's coalition government decides to impeach President Pervaiz Musharraf &amp;#124; Press Release |publisher=Wiredprnews.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, President Pervez Musharraf began consultations with his allies, and with his legal team, on the implications of the impeachment; he said that he was ready to reply to the charges levied upon him and seek the vote of confidence from the senate and the parliament, as required by the coalition parties. However, on 18 August 2008, President [[Pervez Musharraf]] announced in a televised address to the nation that he had decided to resign after nine years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=52487 |title=Musharraf announces resignation |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assemblee nationale Pakistan 01 11.png|left|200px|thumb|The Parliamentary data showing the [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wings]] (in red) occupying the majority of the parliamentary seats with [[Pakistan Muslim League|conservatives]] (in green) being the second largest.]]
The unpopular war in Afghanistan, suspension of chief justice, and state emergency had weakened the presidency of General Musharraf and his allies. In [[Pakistani parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]], the massive vote favored the anti-Musharraf forces - a clear set-back for its United States policies. With left-wing socialists and right-wing conservatives forming an alliance against Musharraf, the elections ensured the come back of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-N. In the presidential election that followed President Pervez Musharraf's resignation, [[Asif Ali Zardari]] of the Peoples Party was elected President of Pakistan. The government of Peoples Party continues to face the formidable challenges of a [[War on terror|war]] on its western border and ever-present internal political bickering. This current period features the [[multiparty democracy]]. 

After the elections, the Peoples Party - with its [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] as the Prime minister (head of the government) - had formed a coalition government, joining hands with the members of the winner parties of the provinces: [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|centre-right conservatives]] from [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], the [[MQM|liberal-seculars]] from [[Sindh Province|Sindh]], the [[Pro-Russian]] [[Awami National Party|left-wing socialists]] from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the religiously [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|right-wing socialists]] from [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], while the Peoples Party had formed an exclusive mandate government in [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]. This alliance made an effort [[Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf|to impeach]] the former president, but shortly after, the centre-right conservatives left the government, due to issues regarding the restoration of judges, and became the largest opposition party in the parliament, nominating its member as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]].
[[File:Syed Gillani - World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Yousaf Raza Gillani]], Sixteenth Prime minister of Pakistan.]]

Pakistan, under Peoples Party's government, headed back toward a major transition from the existing [[semi-presidential system]] to [[Parliamentary democracy|parliamentary democracy rule]]; the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] of Pakistan unanimously passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|18th amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] of Pakistan— a bill which, inter alia, aimed to remove the power of the [[President of Pakistan]] to dissolve the parliament unilaterally. This constitutional amendment is considered a major step toward the parliamentary democracy in the country; it reverses many amendments to the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] carried out since 1973, turns the [[President of Pakistan|President]] into a ceremonial [[head of state]] and transfers the authoritarian and executive powers to the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/09/pakistan.constitution/ | work=CNN | title=Pakistan lawmakers approve weakening of presidential powers | accessdate=2010-05-04 | date=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Peoples Party's government, cooperating with the United States, ordered the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] to launch military campaigns against Taliban advancing in the country. The joint-forces operations led by Pakistan Armed Forces quelled and crushed the Taliban forces in the country (See [[War in North-West Pakistan]]) but paid a heavy price of starting these operations (see [[List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001|Terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001]]). 

Although the government had taken steps to improve relations with the United States and the West, in 2010–11 the anti-American sentiment reached a high level after a [[CIA]] contractor killed civilians in the city of Lahore (see [[Raymond Allen Davis incident]]). Pakistan's relations with United States graphically and dramatically went down after a major event of International importance occurred on the soil of Pakistan on 2 May 2011: The Al-Qaeda supremo [[Osama bin Laden]] was claimed to have been assassinated in his elusive secret hideout in [[Abbottabad]], by the teams of elite [[Navy Seal|SEALs]] and [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]] commandos, through a daring airborne attack, without the knowledge of Pakistan Government. This secret mission was personally authorized by US-president [[Barack Obama]]. The relations of Pakistan and the United States have been weakened and challenging since this operation. While senior U.S. officials openly blamed the Pakistan government for supporting a network of hiding al-Qaeda supremo, it prompted Peoples Party's government and her alliance to review the nation's foreign policy and alliance with the United States. The left-wing alliance favoured alliance with [[Russia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;TEX Release.&quot;/&gt; and the Peoples Party's government adopted the elements of foreign policy of its late leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] - it was decided to enhance relationship and cooperation with Russia that was halted in 1970, after Bhutto's removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEX Release.&quot;/&gt; Since 2011, Pakistan blocked all major [[NATO supply Line]]s after the [[2011 NATO attack in Pakistan|NATO attack]] that resulted in Salala check post. Also since 2011, relations with Russia reached to a maximum level, when President Zardari went to Moscow, the first official trip by any head of state from Pakistan in 37 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEX Release.&quot;/&gt; In return, the Russian commander of Russian Armed Forces, Alexander Postnikov, made a surprise and rare visit to Pakistan. Postnikov's trip was the first of its kind by any senior military official from the former Soviet Union in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEX Release.&quot;/&gt; In 2012, the government made further efforts to establish strong relations with Russia, after the secret trip of country's foreign minister was made.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEX Release.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamran Yousaf|title=Khar off to Russia with love|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/324922/khar-off-to-russia-with-love/|publisher=TEX Release.|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following endless procrastination of [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani]] in probing corruption charges as ordered by the judiciary, and treating it as contempt of court, the Supreme Court of Pakistan disqualified and ousted him and he resigned from office on 26 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/world/asia/political-instability-rises-as-pakistani-court-dismisses-prime-minister.html?pagewanted=all, Retrieved on 11 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;[[Raja Pervaiz Ashraf]] of People's Party took oath as the 17th Prime Minister of Pakistan on 22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/06/201262244252924620.html, Retrieved on 11 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts are already being expressed on his continuance as he is also facing corruption charges in the supreme court.
