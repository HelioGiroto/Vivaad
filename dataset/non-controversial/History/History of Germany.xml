The concept of [[Germany]] as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander [[Julius Caesar]], who referred to the unconquered area east of the [[Rhine]] as ''[[Germania]]'', thus distinguishing it from [[Gaul]] (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] (AD 9) prevented annexation by the [[Roman Empire]]. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the [[Franks]] conquered the other [[West Germanic tribes]]. When the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] was divided among [[Charlemagne]]'s heirs in 843, the eastern part became [[East Francia]]. In 962, [[Otto I]] became the first emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the medieval German state.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], the dukes and princes of the empire gained power at the expense of the emperors. [[Martin Luther]] led the [[Protestant Reformation]] against the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states, such as [[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Saxony]].

After the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–1815), feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 March Revolution]] failed. The [[Industrial Revolution]] modernized the German economy, led to the rapid growth of cities and to the emergence of the [[History of socialism|Socialist movement]] in Germany. Prussia, with its capital [[History of Berlin|Berlin]], grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and the humanities, while music and the arts flourished. Unification was achieved with the formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 under the leadership of Prussian Chancellor  [[Otto von Bismarck]]. The [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government.

By 1900, Germany's economy matched Britain's, allowing [[German colonial empire|colonial expansion]] and a naval race. Germany led the [[Central Powers]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918) against [[French Third Republic|France]], [[British Empire|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and (by 1917) the [[United States]].  Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay [[war reparations]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was stripped of its colonies as well as Polish areas and Alsace-Lorraine. The [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] deposed the emperor and the kings, leading to the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]], an unstable parliamentary democracy.

In the early 1930s, the worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people lost confidence in the government. In 1933, the [[Nazis]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power and established a [[totalitarian]] regime. Political opponents were killed or imprisoned. [[Nazi Germany]]'s aggressive foreign policy took control of Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, and its [[invasion of Poland]] initiated the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After forming a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|pact with the Soviet Union]] in 1939, Hitler's [[blitzkrieg]] swept nearly all of Western Europe. The systematic [[genocide]] program known as [[The Holocaust]] killed six million Jews in Germany and [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied areas]], as well as five million Poles, Romanies, Slavs, Soviets, and others. In 1941, however, the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] failed, and after the United States entered the war, Britain became the base for massive Anglo-American bombings of German cities. Germany fought the war on multiple [[front]]s through 1942–1943. Following the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] (June 1944), the German army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.

Under [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation]] by the Allies, German territories were split off, [[denazification]] took place, and the [[Cold War]] resulted in the division of the country into democratic [[Germany|West Germany]] and communist [[East Germany]]. Millions of ethnic Germans fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic expansion]], and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of [[NATO]], but without access to nuclear weapons. The [[France–Germany relations|Franco-German friendship]] became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the [[European Union]]. 

In 1989, the [[Eastern Bloc]] collapsed and East Germany was [[Reunification of Germany|reunited with West Germany]] in 1990.

In 1998–1999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the [[Eurozone]]. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one quarter of the Eurozone's annual [[gross domestic product]]. In 2012 Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating Euro crisis, especially regarding Greece and other Southern nations.

==Germanic tribes, 750 BC-768 AD==

===Migration and conquest===
{{Main|Germanic peoples|Germania}}
[[File:Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD).png|thumb|Expansion of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] 750 BC – AD&amp;nbsp;1]]
The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] is assumed to have occurred during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], or at the latest during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]], as well as Iranian, [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Central Europe]].

Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their recorded interactions with the [[Roman Empire]], etymological research and archaeological finds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Claster&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Jill N. | last = Claster | title = Medieval Experience: 300–1400 | publisher = [[New York University Press]] | year = 1982 | page = 35 | isbn=0-8147-1381-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otto Albert Koch Varusschlacht 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], the great Germanic victory in 9AD]]
In the first years of the 1st century, Roman legions conducted a long campaign in Germania, the area north of the Upper [[Danube]] and east of the [[Rhine]], in an attempt to expand the Empire's frontiers and shorten its frontier line.  They subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the [[Cherusci]]. The tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In 9 AD, a [[Cherusci]] chieftain named [[Arminius]] defeated a Roman army in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], a victory credited with stopping the Roman advance into Germanic territories&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first= Fergus M. | last = Bordewich | article=The Ambush That Changed History: An amateur archaeologist discovers the field where wily Germanic warriors halted the spread of the Roman Empire | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/ambush.html#ixzz1E6QmkvIw | newspaper = [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] | date = September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forming the birth of German history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Steven | last = Ozment | title = A Mighty Fortress: A New History of the German people | year = 2004 | pages=2–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Germany, east of the [[Rhine]], remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD&amp;nbsp;100, the time of [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes settled along the Roman frontier at the Rhine and the Danube (the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; however, Austria, southern [[Bavaria]], and the western [[Rhineland]] were Roman provinces. 

The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Bavarii]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisii]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the ''Limes'' and the Danube frontier into Roman-controlled lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge ancient history&quot;&gt;{{cite book | series= The Cambridge Ancient History | title = The crisis of empire, A.D. 193–337 | volume = 12 | page = 442 | isbn=0-521-30199-8 | first = Alan K. | last = Bowman | first2 = Peter | last2 = Garnsey | first3 = Averil | last3 = Cameron | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven large German-speaking tribes – the [[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Vandals]], [[Burgundians]], [[Lombards]], [[Saxons]] and [[Franks]] – moved west and took part in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]] and transformation of the old [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Heather | title=Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The unoccupied part of present Germany was invaded by the [[Huns]] at the end of the 4th century and led to the beginning of the [[Migration Period]]. Hunnic hegemony of Germany lasted until 469.

===The Stem Duchies and Marches===
{{Main|Stem duchy}}

[[Stem duchy|Stem Duchies]] (tribal duchies) in Germany were mainly the areas of the old German tribes of the region, especially in the [[East Francia|east]].  

In the 5th century, the ''[[Völkerwanderung]]'' (or Germanic migrations) brought a number of [[Barbarian]] tribes into the failing [[Roman Empire]]. Tribes that became stem duchies were originally the [[Alamanni]], the [[Thuringii]], the [[Saxons]], the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Rugii]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Germany | encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | year = 2012 | accessdate= 12 September 2012 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231186/Germany/58091/Rise-of-the-duchies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to later [[duchies]], these entities were not defined by strict administrative boundaries but by the area of settlement of major Germanic [[tribe]]s. Over the next few centuries, some tribes warred, migrated, and merged.  All these tribes in Germania were eventually subjugated by the [[Franks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Walter A. | last=Goffart |title=The narrators of barbarian history (A.D. 550–800): Jordanes, Gregory of Tours, Bede, and Paul the Deacon | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1988 | url = http://hdl.handle.net.proxy.cc.uic.edu/2027/heb.01027}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, remnants of several stem duchies survive today as states or regions in modern [[Western Europe]] countries: German [[States of Germany|states]] such as [[Bavaria]] and [[Saxony]], German regions like [[Swabia]], and French ''région''s such as of [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]], and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;friesian1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/germany.htm |title=Germany, the Stem Duchies &amp; Marches |publisher=Friesian.com |date=1945-02-13 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germans]] in the east also founded a series of border counties or [[March (territory)#Germany and Austria|Marches]]. To the north, these included [[Lusatia]], the [[North March]] that would become [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and the heart of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and the [[Billung March]]. In the south, the marches included [[Carniola]], [[Styria]], and the [[March of Austria]] that would become [[Austria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;friesian1&quot;/&gt;

===Frankish Empire===
{{Main|Frankish Empire}}
[[File:Empire carolingien 768-811.jpg|thumb|400px|Expansion of the [[Frankish Empire]]:&lt;br&gt;Blue = realm of [[Pippin III]] in 758,&lt;br&gt;Red = expansion under [[Charlemagne]] until 814,&lt;br&gt;Yellow = [[marches]] and dependencies]]

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Franks created an empire under the [[Merovingian]] kings and subjugated the other Germanic tribes. The Merovingian kings of the Germanic Franks conquered northern Gaul in 486 AD. [[Swabia]] became a duchy under the [[Frankish Empire]] in 496, following the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]; in 530 Saxons and Franks destroyed the Kingdom of [[Thuringia]]. In the 5th and 6th centuries the Merovingian kings conquered several other Germanic tribes and kingdoms. King [[Chlothar I]] (558–561) ruled the greater part of what is now Germany and made expeditions into [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], while the Southeast of modern Germany was still under influence of the [[Ostrogoths]]. Saxons inhabited the area down to the [[Unstrut]] River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=James |title =The Franks | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions of the Frankish Empire were placed under the control of autonomous dukes of mixed Frankish and native blood. Frankish Colonists were encouraged to move to the newly conquered territories. While the local Germanic tribes were allowed to preserve their laws, they were pressured into becoming Christians.

The German territories became part of [[Austrasia]] (meaning &quot;eastern land&quot;), the northeastern portion of the Kingdom of the [[Merovingian]] [[Franks]]. As a whole, Austrasia comprised parts of present day [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. After the death of the Frankish king [[Clovis I]] in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom including [[Austrasia]]. Authority over Austrasia passed back and forth from autonomy to kingly subjugation, as Frankish lands were alternately united and subdivided by the [[Merovingian]] kings. 

In 718, [[Charles Martel]], the Franconian [[Mayor of the Palace]], made war against Saxony because of its help for the [[Neustria]]ns. His son [[Carloman, son of the Charles Martel|Carloman]] started a new war against Saxony in 743, because the Saxons gave aid to Duke [[Odilo of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last =Fouracre | title=The Age of Charles Martel | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 751 [[Pippin III]], [[Mayor of the Palace]] under the Merovingian king, himself assumed the title of king and was anointed by the Church.  Now the Frankish kings were set up as protectors of the [[pope]], and [[Charles the Great]] launched a decades-long military campaign against their heathen rivals, the [[Saxons]] and the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]].  The campaigns and insurrections of the [[Saxon Wars]] lasted from 772 to 804. The Saxons and Avars were eventually overwhelmed, the people were forcibly converted to [[Christianity]], and the lands were annexed by the [[Carolingian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Rosamond |last =McKitterick | title =Charlemagne: The Formation of a European Identity | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlemagne===

After the 768 death of Frankish King [[Pepin the Short]], his son Charles consolidated his control over his kingdom and became known as &quot;Charles the Great&quot; or &quot;[[Charlemagne]].&quot; From 771 until his death in 814, [[Charlemagne]] extended the Carolingian empire into northern Italy and the territories of all west Germanic peoples, including the Saxons and the Bajuwari (Bavarians).  In 800, Charlemagne's authority was confirmed by his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by the [[Pope Leo III|pope]] on [[Christmas Day]] in Rome.  Imperial strongholds (''Kaiserpfalzen'') became economic and cultural centres, of which [[Aachen]] was the most famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=J.L. |last=Nelson | article=Charlemagne's church at Aachen | newspaper=History Today | year=1998 | volume =48(1) | pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting among Charlemagne's grandchildren caused the Carolingian empire to be partitioned into several parts by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] (870), and the [[Treaty of Ribemont]]. The German region developed out of the East Frankish kingdom, [[East Francia]]. From 919 to 936, the Germanic peoples – [[Franks]], [[Saxons]], [[Swabians]], and Bavarians – were united under [[Henry the Fowler]], Duke of Saxony, who took the title of king.&lt;ref name=schulman&gt;{{cite book | first=Jana K. | last=Schulman | title=The Rise of the Medieval World, 500–1300: A Biographical Dictionary | publisher =Greenwood Press | year=2002 | pages= 208, Pp. 325–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the term &quot;Kingdom (Empire) of the Germans&quot; (''[[Regnum Teutonicorum]]'') was applied to a Frankish kingdom, although ''Teutonicorum'' at its founding originally meant something closer to &quot;Realm of the Germanic peoples&quot; or &quot;Germanic Realm&quot; than &quot;realm of the Germans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In recent times, the [[Regnum Teutonicorum]] has been referred to as the &quot;First Reich,&quot; with Otto von Bismarck's Prussian-built empire called the &quot;Second Reich&quot; and Adolf Hitler's regime called the &quot;Third Reich&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otto the Great===
In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I the Great]] was crowned as king at Aachen; his coronation as emperor by the Pope at Rome in 962 inaugurated what became later known as the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which became to be identified with Germany.&lt;ref name=schulman/&gt; Otto strengthened the royal authority by re-asserting the old Carolingian rights over ecclesiastical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Geoffrey | last=Barraclough |title=The origins of modern Germany? | year=1984 | page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Otto wrested from the nobles the powers of appointment of the bishops and abbots, who controlled large land holdings. Additionally, Otto revived the old Carolingian program of appointing missionaries in the border lands.  Otto continued to support [[celibacy]] for the higher clergy, so ecclesiastical appointments never became hereditary. By granting land to the abbotts and bishops he appointed, Otto actually made these bishops into &quot;princes of the Empire&quot; (''[[Reichsfürsten]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James K. |last= Pollack | first2=Homer | last2=Thomas | title=Germany in Power and Eclipse | year=1952 | page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in this way, Otto was able to establish a national church. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained with the decisive defeat of the Hungarian [[Magyars]] at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955.  The [[Slavs]] between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]] rivers were also subjugated.  Otto marched on Rome and drove [[John XII]] from the papal throne and for years controlled the election of the pope, setting a firm precedent for imperial control of the papacy for years to come.

During the reign of Conrad II's son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] (1039  to 1056), the empire supported the [[Cluniac reforms]] of the Church – the [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace of God]], prohibition of [[simony]] (the purchase of clerical offices), and required [[celibacy]] of priests.  Imperial authority over the Pope reached its peak.  In the [[Investiture Controversy]] which began between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Pope Gregory VII]] over appointments to ecclesiastical offices, the emperor was compelled to submit to the Pope at [[Canossa]] in 1077, after having been excommunicated. In 1122 a temporary reconciliation was reached between [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] and the Pope with the [[Concordat of Worms]]. The consequences of the investiture dispute were a weakening of the Ottonian church (''Reichskirche''), and a strengthening of the Imperial secular princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John M. | last=Jeep | title=Medieval Germany: an encyclopedia | year=2001 | page=881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time between 1096 and 1291 was the age of the [[crusade]]s. Knightly religious orders were established, including the [[Knights Templar]], the Knights of St John ([[Knights Hospitaller]]), and the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Zsolt | editor-last=Hunyadi | editor2-first=Jozsef | editor2-last=Laszlovszky | title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity (CEU Medievalia) | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sacrum imperium'' (Holy Empire) was first used under Friedrich I, documented first in 1157.

===Hanseatic League===
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|300px|right|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League]]
Long-distance trade in the Baltic intensified, as the major trading towns became drawn together in the [[Hanseatic League]], under the leadership of [[Lübeck]]. The [[Hanseatic League]] was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe. Each of the Hanseatic cities had its own legal system and a degree of political autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Clive |last=Day |title=A history of commerce | year=1914 | pages=252+ | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AQpDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=%22Hanseatic+League%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=1&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief cities were [[History of Cologne|Cologne]] on the [[Rhine]] River, [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] on the [[North Sea]], and Lübeck on the [[Baltic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James Westfall | last= Thompson | title=Economic and Social History of Europe in the Later Middle Ages (1300–1530) | year=1931 | pages=146–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League flourished from 1200 to 1500, and continued with lesser importance after that.

===Eastward expansion===
{{main|Ostsiedlung}}
The German colonisation and the chartering of new towns and villages began into largely Slav-inhabited territories east of the [[Elbe]], such as [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]], and [[Livonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Marshall |last=Dill, Jr. |title=Germany: A Modern History | year=1970 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1226, the [[Teutonic Knights]] began their conquest of [[History of Prussia|Prussia]]. The native [[Prussian people|Baltic Prussians]] were conquered and Christianized by the Knights with much warfare, and numerous German towns were established along the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Francis |last=Carsten |title=The origins of Prussia | year=1958 | pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church and state===
[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Barbarossa]] was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1155 to 1190.]]
[[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] (1086–1125), great-grandson of Conrad II, became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1106 in the midst of a civil war. Hoping to gain complete control over the church inside the Empire, Henry V appointed [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert of Saarbrücken]] as the powerful [[archbishop of Mainz]] in 1111.  Adalbert began to assert the powers of the Church against secular authorities, that is, the Emperor. This precipitated the &quot;Crisis of 1111&quot;, part of the long-term [[Investiture Controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Uta-Renate | last=Blumenthal | title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century | year=1991 | pages=159–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1137 the magnates turned back to the [[Hohenstaufen]] family for a candidate, [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]].  Conrad III tried to divest [[Henry the Proud]] of his two duchies – [[Duke of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Rulers of Saxony|Saxony]] – leading to war in southern Germany as the Empire divided into two factions.  The first faction called themselves the &quot;[[Welfs]]&quot; or &quot;Guelphs&quot; after Henry the Proud's family, which was the ruling dynasty in Bavaria; the other faction was known as the &quot;Waiblings.&quot; In this early period, the Welfs generally represented ecclesiastical independence under the papacy plus &quot;particularism&quot; (a strengthening of the local duchies against the central imperial authority).  The Waiblings, on the other hand, stood for control of the Church by a strong central Imperial government.&lt;ref name=fuhrmann&gt;{{cite book | first=Horst | last=Fuhrmann | title=Germany in the High Middle Ages, c. 1050–1200 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1152 and 1190, during the reign of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] (Barbarossa), of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] dynasty, an accommodation was reached with the rival [[House of Welf|Guelph]] party by the grant of the duchy of Bavaria to [[Henry the Lion]], duke of [[Lower Saxony|Saxony]].  Austria became a separate duchy by virtue of the [[Privilegium Minus]] in 1156.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert A. | last=Kahn |title=A History of the Habsburg Empire 1526–1918 | year=1974 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barbarossa tried to reassert his control over Italy.  In 1177 a final reconciliation was reached between the emperor and the Pope in [[Venice]].

In 1180, Henry the Lion was outlawed; Saxony was divided, and Bavaria was given to [[Otto I Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]]. (Otto founded the [[Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]], which was to rule Bavaria until 1918.)

From 1184 to 1186, the Hohenstaufen empire under [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] reached its peak in the ''Reichsfest'' (imperial celebrations) held at [[Mainz]] and the marriage of his son [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] in Milan to the [[Normans|Norman]] princess [[Constance of Sicily]]. The power of the feudal lords was undermined by the appointment of &quot;ministerials&quot; (unfree servants of the Emperor) as officials. Chivalry and the court life flowered, leading to a development of German culture and literature (see [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]).

Between 1212 and 1250 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] established a modern, professionally administered state from his base in [[Sicily]]. He resumed the conquest of Italy, leading to further conflict with the [[Papacy]]. In the Empire, extensive sovereign powers were granted to ecclesiastical and secular princes, leading to the rise of independent territorial states. The struggle with the Pope sapped the Empire's strength, as Frederick II was excommunicated three times. After his death, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell, followed by an interregnum during which there was no Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ernst | last=Kantorowicz | title=Frederick the Second, 1194–1250 | year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of negotiations between Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] and the papacy led in 1338 to the [[declaration at Rhense]] by six [[prince-elector|electors]] to the effect that election by all or the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. As result, the monarch was no longer subject to papal approbation and became increasingly dependent on the favour of the electors. Between 1346 and 1378 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] of [[Luxembourg]], king of Bohemia, sought to restore the imperial authority. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] stipulated that in future the emperor was to be chosen by four secular electors and three spiritual electors. The secular electors were the King of Bohemia, the [[Count Palatine]] of the Rhine, the Duke of [[Saxony]], and the Margrave of [[Brandenburg]]; the three spiritual electors were the Archbishops of [[Mainz]], [[Trier]], and [[Cologne]].

Around 1350 Germany and almost the whole of Europe were ravaged by the [[Black Death]]. Jews were persecuted on religious and economic grounds; many fled to Poland.

===Change and reform===
After the disasters of the 14th century – war, [[Black Death|plague]], and [[Western Schism|schism]] – early-modern European society gradually came into being as a result of economic, religious, and political changes. A money economy arose which provoked social discontent among knights and peasants. Gradually, a proto-capitalistic system evolved out of feudalism. The [[Fugger]] family gained prominence through commercial and financial activities and became financiers to both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. The knightly classes found their monopoly on arms and military skill undermined by the introduction of mercenary armies and foot soldiers. Predatory activity by &quot;robber knights&quot; became common. 

From 1438 the [[Habsburg]]s, who controlled most of the southeast of the Empire (more or less modern-day Austria and [[Slovenia]], and Bohemia and [[Moravia]] after the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]] in 1526), maintained a constant grip on the position of the Holy Roman Emperor until 1806 (with the exception of the years between 1742 and 1745). This situation, however, gave rise to increased disunity among the Holy Roman Empire's territorial rulers and prevented sections of the country from coming together to form nations in the manner of [[France]] and [[England]].

During his reign from 1493 to 1519, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] tried to reform the Empire. An Imperial supreme court (''Reichskammergericht'') was established, imperial taxes were levied, and the power of the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''Reichstag'') was increased. The reforms, however, were frustrated by the continued territorial fragmentation of the Empire.

===Towns and cities===
The German lands had a population of about 5 or 6 million.  The great majority were farmers, typically in a state of [[serfdom]] under the control of nobles and monasteries.&lt;ref name=fuhrmann/&gt; A few towns were starting to emerge. From 1100, new towns were founded around imperial strongholds, castles, bishops' palaces, and monasteries. The towns began to establish municipal rights and liberties (see [[German town law]]). Several cities such as [[Cologne]] became [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]], which did not depend on princes or bishops, but were immediately subject to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alfred | last=Haverkamp | title=Medieval Germany, 1056–1273 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towns were ruled by patricians: merchants carrying on long-distance trade. [[Craftsmen]] formed [[guilds]], governed by strict rules, which sought to obtain control of the towns; a few were open to women. Society was divided into sharply demarcated classes: the [[clergy]], [[physicians]], [[merchants]], various guilds of artisans, and [[peasants]]; full citizenship was not available to [[paupers]]. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Nicholas | title=The Growth of the Medieval City: From Late Antiquity to the Early Fourteenth Century | publisher=Longman | year=1997).

[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Cologne around 1411]]
[[History of Cologne|Cologne's]] central location on the [[Rhine]] river placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Strait | title=Cologne in the Twelfth Century | year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the city's status as a major harbor and transport hub upon the Rhine.  It was the seat of the archbishops, who ruled the surrounding area and (from 1248 to 1880) built the great [[Cologne Cathedral]], with sacred relics that made it a [[pilgrimage|destination]] for many worshippers. By 1288 the city had secured its independence from the archbishop (who relocated to Bonn), and was ruled by its [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Joseph P. | last=Huffman | title=Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne| year=1998}} – covers from 1000 to 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and culture===
In the 12th century, [[German people|German]] [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) wrote several influential theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, [[liturgical]] songs, poems, and arguably the oldest surviving [[morality play]], while supervising brilliant miniature [[Illumination (manuscript)|Illuminations]]. Ca. 100 years later, [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (c. 1170-c. 1230) became the most celebrated of the [[Middle High German]] lyric [[poet]]s. 

Around 1439, [[Johannes Gutenberg]], a citizen of [[Mainz]], was the first European to use [[movable type]] printing and became the global inventor of the [[printing press]], thereby starting the [[Printing Revolution]]. Gutenberg's inventions and works (such as the [[Gutenberg Bible]]) would play key roles for the development of the [[Reformation]] and the [[Scientific Revolution]]. 

Around the transition from the 15th to the 16th century, [[Albrecht Dürer]] from [[Nuremberg]] established his reputation across Europe as [[painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], [[mathematician]], [[engraver]], and [[theorist]] when he was still in his twenties and secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the [[Northern Renaissance]].

The addition ''Nationis Germanicæ'' (of German Nation) to the emperor's title appeared first in the 15th century: in a 1486 law decreed by Friedrich III and in 1512 in reference to the ''Reichstag'' in Cologne by Maximilian I. By then, the emperors had lost their influence in Italy and Burgundy. In 1525, the Heilbronn reform plan – the most advanced document of the [[German Peasants' War]] (''Deutscher Bauernkrieg'') – referred to the ''Reich'' as ''von Teutscher Nation'' (of German nation).

===Reformation===
[[File:Luther46c.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546)]]
In the early 16th century there was much discontent occasioned by abuses such as [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church, and a general desire for reform.

In 1517 the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]]; he had posted them in the town square, and gave copies of them to German nobles, but it is debated whether he nailed them to the church door in [[Wittenberg]] as is commonly said.  The list detailed 95 assertions Luther believed to show corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  One often cited example, though perhaps not Luther's chief concern, is a condemnation of the selling of [[indulgences]]; another prominent point within the 95 Theses is Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy, especially the pope, used and abused power, and with the very idea of the pope.

In 1521 Luther was outlawed at the [[Diet of Worms]]. But the Reformation spread rapidly, helped by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s wars with France and the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. Hiding in the [[Wartburg Castle]], Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed the others and evolved into what is now the modern German.

In 1524 the [[German Peasants' War]] broke out in [[Swabia]], [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] against ruling princes and lords, following the preachings of Reformist priests. But the revolts, which were assisted by war-experienced noblemen like [[Götz von Berlichingen]] and [[Florian Geyer]] (in Franconia), and by the theologian [[Thomas Münzer]] (in Thuringia), were soon repressed by the territorial princes. It is estimated that as many as 100,000 German peasants were massacred during the revolt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.questia.com/library/history/peasants-war.jsp |title=Peasants' War}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually after the battles had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.saburchill.com/history/chapters/chap5109.html | title= The Catholic and the Lutheran Church | publisher = The Open Door Web Site (ODWS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; at Augsburg (1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged.

From 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany. The main force was provided by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]], founded by the Spaniard [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. Central and northeastern Germany were by this time almost wholly Protestant, whereas western and southern Germany remained predominantly Catholic. In 1547, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.

The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler ([[Cuius regio, eius religio]]).

In 1556 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] abdicated. The Habsburg Empire was divided, as [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] was separated from the Imperial possessions.

In 1608/1609 the [[Protestant Union]] and the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] were formed.

===Thirty Years War===
[[File:Straty ludnościowe po wojnie 30letniej.PNG|thumb|Reduction of the population of the Holy Roman Empire as a consequence of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]
From 1618 to 1648 the [[Thirty Years' War]] ravaged in the Holy Roman Empire. The causes were the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the efforts by the various states within the Empire to increase their power and the Catholic Emperor's attempt to achieve the religious and political unity of the Empire. The immediate occasion for the war was the uprising of the Protestant nobility of Bohemia against the emperor, but the conflict was widened into a European War by the intervention of [[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV of Denmark]] (1625–29), [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] (1630–48) and France under [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Germany became the main theatre of war and the scene of the final conflict between France and the Habsburgs for predominance in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter H. |last=Wilson | title=The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting often was out of control, with marauding bands of hundreds or thousands of starving soldiers spreading plague, plunder, and murder.  The armies that were under control moved back and forth across the countryside year after year, levying heavy taxes on cities, and seizing the animals and food stocks of the peasants without payment.  The enormous social disruption over three decades caused a dramatic decline in population because of killings, disease, crop failures, declining birth rates and random destruction, and the out-migration of terrified people. One estimate shows a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650, while another shows &quot;only&quot; a 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The [[Altmark]] and [[History of Württemberg|Württemberg]] regions especially hard hit. It took generations for Germany to fully recover.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''The Thirty Years' War'' (1997) p. 178 has 15–20% decline; Tryntje Helfferich, ''The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History'' (2009) p. xix, estimates a 25% decline. Wilson (2009) pp. 780–95 reviews the estimates.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The war ended in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]].  [[Alsace]] was permanently lost to France, [[Pomerania]] was temporarily lost to Sweden, and the Netherlands officially left the Empire. Imperial power declined further as the states' rights were increased.

===Culture and literacy===
The German population reached about twenty million people, the great majority of whom were peasant farmers.&lt;ref name=holborn-reform&gt;{{cite book | first=Hajo | last=Holborn |title=A History of Germany: The Reformation | year=1959 | pages= 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|300px|Bible translated into Modern High German by Luther, 1534]]
The Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press. Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. By 1530 over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a &quot;good&quot; against &quot;bad&quot; church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mark U. | last=Edwards, Jr. | title=Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially effective were Luther's ''Small Catechism'', for use of parents teaching their children,  and ''Larger Catechism,'' for pastors.&lt;ref&gt;See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn Project Wittenberg: &quot;Selected Hymns of Martin Luther&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther's ideas. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553), the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Christoph |last=Weimer |title=Luther and Cranach on Justification in Word and Image | journal=Lutheran Quarterly | year=2004 | volume =18 |issue=4 |pages=387–405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther's German translation of the Bible was also decisive for the [[German language]] and its evolution from  [[Early New High German]] to Modern Standard. His bible promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area.

===Science===
Decisive scientific developments took place during the 16th and 17th centuries, especially in the fields of astronomy, mathematics and physics. In 1543, [[astronomer]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] from [[Toruń]] (Thorn) published his work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' and became the first person to formulate a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] cosmology that displaced the Earth from the center of the universe. Almost 70 years after Copernicus's death and building on his theories, astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] from [[Stuttgart]] was a leader in the 17th century [[scientific revolution]]. He is best known for his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]. His works ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' and ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' were further codified by later astronomers. These works also influenced contemporary Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] and provided one of the foundations for Englishman [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].

==1648–1815==
[[File:Acprussiamap2.gif|thumb|300px|After 1763, Prussia became a European great power. The rivalry between Prussia and Austria for the leadership of Germany began]]

From 1640, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] had started to rise under the Great Elector, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]]. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 strengthened it even further, through the acquisition of East Pomerania.  From 1713 to 1740, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I]], also known as the &quot;Soldier King&quot;, established a highly centralized, militarized state with a heavily rural population of about three million (compared to the nine million in Austria).

In terms of the boundaries of 1914, Germany in 1700 had a population of 16 million, increasing slightly to 17 million by 1750, and growing more rapidly to 24 million by 1800.  Wars continued, but they were no longer so devastating to the civilian population; famines and major epidemics did not occur, but increased agricultural productivity led to a higher birth rate, and a lower death rate.&lt;ref name=sheehan&gt;{{cite book | first=James J. |last=Sheehan | title=German History: 1770–1866 | year=1989 | pages=75,  207-291, 291-323, 324-371, 802-820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars===
[[Louis XIV of France]] conquered parts of [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace and Lorraine]] (1678–1681), and had invaded and devastated the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] (1688–1697) in the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of Palatinian Succession]]. Louis XIV benefited from the Empire's problems with the Turks, which were menacing Austria. Louis XIV ultimately had to relinquish the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]].[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II, the Great, of Prussia]] (1712–1786)]] Afterwards Hungary was reconquered from the Turks; Austria, under the Habsburgs, developed into a great power.

In the [[War of Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748) [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] fought successfully for recognition of her succession to the throne. But in the [[Silesian Wars]] and in the [[Seven Years' War]] she had to cede Silesia to [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II, the Great, of Prussia]]. After the [[Peace of Hubertsburg]] in 1763 between Austria, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Saxony]], Prussia became a European great power. This gave the start to the rivalry between Prussia and Austria for the leadership of Germany.

From 1763, against resistance from the nobility and citizenry, an &quot;[[enlightened absolutism]]&quot; was established in Prussia and Austria, according to which the ruler governed according to the best precepts of the philosophers. The economies developed and legal reforms were undertaken, including the abolition of torture and the improvement in the status of Jews. Emancipation of the peasants slowly began. Compulsory education was instituted.

In 1772–1795 Prussia took part in the [[partitions of Poland]]. Prussia occupied the western territories of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] that surrounded existing Prussian holdings. This occupation led to centuries of Polish resistance against Germanization.

===Smaller states===
Completely overshadowed by Prussia and Austria, the smaller German states were generally characterized by political lethargy and administrative inefficiency, often compounded by rulers who were more concerned with their mistresses and their hunting dogs than with the affairs of state.  [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] was especially unfortunate in this regard; it was a rural land with very heavy debts and few growth centers. [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] was in economically good shape, although its government was seriously mismanaged, and numerous wars had taken their toll. In [[History of Württemberg|Württemberg]] the duke lavished funds on palaces, mistresses, great celebration, and hunting expeditions. Many of the city-states of Germany were run by bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant interest in religion.  None developed a significant reputation for good government.&lt;ref name=holborn-1648&gt;{{cite book | last=Holborn | first=Hajo | title=A History of Modern Germany: 1648–1840 | year=1964 | pages=291–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Residenzschloss Ludwigsburg.jpg|thumb|center|550px|[[Ludwigsburg Palace]] in Württemberg]]

In [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], the Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Frederick II]], ruled 1760–1785 as an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers ([[Hessian (soldiers)|called &quot;Hessians&quot;]]) to [[Great Britain]] to help fight the [[American Revolutionary War]].  He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles W. |last=Ingrao | title=The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760–1785 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of Hanover|Hanover]] did not have to support a lavish court—its rulers were also kings of England and resided in London. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], elector (ruler) from 1760 to 1820, never once visited Hanover.  The local nobility who ran the country opened the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1737; it soon became a world-class intellectual center.  [[File:Karl Friedrich von Baden.jpg|thumb|150px|Karl Friedrich ruled Baden 1738–1811]] [[History of Baden|Baden]] sported perhaps the best government of the smaller states. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Karl Friedrich]] ruled well for 73 years (1738–1811) and was an enthusiast for [[The Enlightenment]]; he abolished serfdom in 1783. 

The smaller states failed to form coalitions with each other, and were eventually overwhelmed by Prussia.&lt;ref name=holborn-1648/&gt; Between 1807 and 1871, Prussia swallowed up many of the smaller states, with minimal protest, then went on to found the German Empire.  In the process, Prussia became too heterogeneous, lost its identity, and by the 1930s had become an administrative shell of little importance.

===Nobility===
In a heavily agrarian society, land ownership played a central role.  Germany's nobles, especially those in the East – called [[Junker]]s – dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army.  Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute.  To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Eda | last=Segarra | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648–1914 | year=1977 | pages=37–55, 183–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasants and rural life===
[[Image:Adriaen van Ostade - Peasants in a Tavern.jpg|thumb|&quot;Peasants in a Tavern&quot; by [[Adriaen van Ostade]] (c. 1635), at the Alte Pinakothek, Munich]]
Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body and help manage the community resources and monitor the community life.  In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently  to parcels of land.  In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman.  Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses.  Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children.  Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army.  The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.&lt;ref name=sagarra&gt;{{cite book | last =Sagarra | first=Eda | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648–1914 | year=1977 | pages=140–154, 341–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, &quot;Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania,&quot; ''Genealogist,'' Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 131–169&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation of the serfs came in 1770–1830, beginning with Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]] (1757–1831), who was influenced by [[The Enlightenment]], especially the free market ideas of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Guy Stanton | last=Ford | title=Stein and the era of reform in Prussia, 1807–1815 | year=1922 | pages=199–220 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y6INAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowner could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasant became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815.  In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully.  In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive.  Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remains quite strong over the villagers.  Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land like serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=sagarra/&gt;

The agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany in the era 1770–1870 were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished feudal obligations and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy. It produced increased productivity and population growth. It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Stefan | last=Brakensiek | title=Agrarian Individualism in North-Western Germany, 1770–1870 | newspaper=German History | date=April 1994 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=137–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the east the serfs were emancipated but the [[Junker|Junker class]] maintained its large estates and monopolized political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=J.

Around 1800 the Catholic monasteries, which had large land holdings, were nationalized and sold off by the government. In Bavaria they had controlled 56% of the land.&lt;ref name=nipperdey&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=Nipperdey | title=Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800–1866 | year=1996 | pages=59, 86, 87–92, 96–97, 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment ===
[[Image:Oer-Weimarer Musenhof.jpg|thumb|left|''Weimar’s Courtyard of the Muses'', a tribute to [[The Enlightenment]] and the [[Weimar Classicism]] depicting German poets [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].]]
Before 1750 the German upper classes looked to France for intellectual, cultural and architectural leadership; French was the language of high society. By the mid-18th century the &quot;Aufklärung&quot; ([[The Enlightenment]]) had transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science and literature.  [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers; he legitimized German as a philosophic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John G. | last=Gagliardo | title=Germany under the Old Regime, 1600–1790 | year=1991 | pages=217–34, 375–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] (1744–1803) broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement of proto-Romanticism. [[Weimar Classicism]] (&quot;Weimarer Klassik&quot;) was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from 1772 until 1805, involved Herder as well as polymath [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759–1805), a poet and historian.  Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism.  Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first=Simon J. |editor-last=Richter | title=The Literature of Weimar Classicism | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers  [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809), and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Samantha | editor-last=Owens | editor2-last =Reul | editor2-first =Barbara M. | editor3-last =Stockigt | editor3-first =Janice B. | title=Music at German Courts, 1715–1760: Changing Artistic Priorities | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In remote [[Königsberg]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom, and political authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Manfred | last=Kuehn | title=Kant: A Biography | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats, and the middle classes, and it permanently reshaped the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Van Dulmen | editor2-first=Anthony | editor2-last=Williams | title=The Society of the Enlightenment: The Rise of the Middle Class and Enlightenment Culture in Germany | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution 1789–1815===
[[File:Rheinbund 1812.png|thumb|The [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a confederation of client states of the First French Empire, existed from 1806 to 1813.]]
German reaction to the [[French Revolution]] was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and  The Enlightenment.  The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of the French king]] and the onset of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.&lt;ref name=sheehan/&gt;

Europe was racked by two decades of war revolving around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty.  War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (1792).  The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the [[Thirty Years' War]], almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795. The French took control of the [[Rhineland]], imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] (1807–1813) as a model state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Owen |last=Connelly | title=Napoleon's satellite kingdoms |year=1966 | chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity.  A [[Second Coalition]] of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire was little more than a farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control.  In Germany Napoleon set up the &quot;[[Confederation of the Rhine]],&quot; comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.&lt;ref name=raff/&gt;

Prussia tried to remain neutral while imposing tight controls on dissent, but with German nationalism sharply on the rise, the small nation blundered by going to war with Napoleon in 1806. Its economy was weak, its leadership poor, and the once mighty Prussian army was a hollow shell. Napoleon easily crushed it at the [[Battle of Jena]] (1806). Napoleon occupied Berlin, and Prussia paid dearly. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed, and Berlin had to pay Paris heavy reparations and fund the French army of occupation. Saxony changed sides to support Napoleon and join his Confederation of the Rhine; its elector was rewarded with the title of king and given a slice of Poland taken from Prussia.  

After Napoleon's fiasco in Russia in 1812, including the deaths of many Germans in his invasion army, Prussia joined with Russia. Major battles followed in quick order, and when Austria switched sides to oppose Napoleon his situation grew tenuous. He was defeated in a great [[Battle of Leipzig]] in late 1813, and Napoleon's empire started to collapse. One after another the German states switched to oppose Napoleon, but he rejected peace terms. Allied armies invaded France in early 1814, Paris fell, and in April Napoleon surrendered. He returned for 100 days in 1815, but was finally defeated by the British and German armies at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Prussia was the big winner at the Vienna peace conference, gaining extensive territory.&lt;ref name=sheehan/&gt;

==German Confederation==
{{main|German Confederation}}
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|450px|The [[German Confederation]] 1815–1866. Prussia (in blue) considerably expanded its territory.]]
The '''German Confederation'''  ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was the loose association of 39 states created in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries.  It acted as a buffer between the powerful states of Austria and Prussia.  Britain approved of it because London felt that there was need for a stable, peaceful power in central Europe that could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. According to Lee (1985), most historians have judged the Confederation to be weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to German nationalist aspirations. It collapsed because the rivalry between Prussia and Austria (known as [[German dualism]]), warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Loyd E. |last= Lee |title=The German Confederation and the Consolidation of State Power in the South German States, 1815–1848 | journal=Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Proceedings | year= 1985 | volumen=15 | pages=332–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by the [[North German Confederation]] in 1866.

===Society and economy===

====Population====
The population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865, from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000.&lt;ref name=nipperdey/&gt;  The era saw the [[Demographic Transition]] take place in Germany. It was a transition from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages  took place after age 25.  After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply, and a decline in famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and have more children.  Arranged marriages became uncommon as young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and emigration, especially after about 1840, mostly to the [[German-Americans|German settlements in the United States]], plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures.  The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants.&lt;ref name=nipperdey/&gt;

====Industrialization====
Before 1850 Germany lagged far behind the leaders in industrial development – Britain, France, and Belgium. In 1800, Germany's social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the era of the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important institutional reforms. Reforms included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in most of Germany. Until midcentury, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches, and the government bureaucracies had so many rules and restrictions that entrepreneurship was held in low esteem, and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony, and other states reorganized agriculture. The introduction of sugar beets, turnips, and potatoes yielded a higher level of food production, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas. The beginnings of the industrial revolution in Germany came in the textile industry, and was facilitated by eliminating tariff barriers through the Zollverein, starting in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Richard | last=Tilly | chapter=Germany: 1815–1870 | editor-first=Rondo |editor-last=Cameron | title=Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1967 | pages=151–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By midcentury, the German states were catching up. By 1900 Germany was a world leader in industrialization, along with Britain and the United States.

====Urbanization====
Industrialization brought rural Germans to the factories, mines and railways. The population in 1800 was heavily rural, with only 10% of the people living in communities of 5000 or more people, and only 2% living in cities of more than 100,000.  After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due primarily to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 in 1870; Hamburg grew from 130,000 to 290,000; Munich from 40,000 to 269,000; and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000.  Offsetting this growth, there was extensive emigration, especially to the United States.  Emigration totaled 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and 780,000 in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=nipperdey/&gt;

====Railways====
{{Main|History of rail transport in Germany}}
[[File:Friedrich List und die erste grosse Eisenbahn 2.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich List]]'s concept for a German railway net from 1833]]
The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron.  Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist [[Friedrich List]] summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:
:
# As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.
# It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.
# It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.
# It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.&lt;ref&gt;List quoted  in John J. Lalor, ed. ''Cyclopædia of Political Science'' (1881) 3:118
[http://www.econlib.org/Library/YPDBooks/Lalor/llCy888.html online]; see Nipperdey (1996) p.&amp;nbsp;165&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain’s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day, and forged ahead of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allan |last=Mitchell | title=Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Science and culture====
German artists and intellectuals, heavily influenced by the French Revolution and by the great German poet and writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832), turned to [[Romanticism]] after a period of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Philosophical thought was decisively shaped by [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804). [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827) was the leading composer of [[Romantic music]]. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced [[Franz Schubert]] (1797–1828) and [[Robert Schumann]] (1810–1856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (1786–1826) and perfected by [[Richard Wagner]] (1813–1883) in his [[Ring Cycle]]. The [[Brothers Grimm]] (1785–1863 &amp; 1786–1859) not only wrote the popular [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], but were among the founding fathers of [[German philology]] and [[German studies]].

At the universities high-powered professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) in philosophy, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834) in theology and [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886) in history, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], founded in 1810, became the world's leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769–1859) in natural science and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed Revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.&lt;ref name=sheehan/&gt;

===Politics of restoration and revolution===
{{Main|German Confederation}}

====German Confederation and the early 1800s====
After the fall of Napoleon, Europe's statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Austrian Prince Metternich]]. The political principles agreed upon at this [[Congress of Vienna]] included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas.

The [[German Confederation]] ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded, a loose union of 39 states (35 ruling princes and 4 free cities) under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet ({{lang-de|[[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundestag]]}}) meeting in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its own interests.

In 1819 a student radical assassinated the reactionary playwright [[August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue|August von Kotzebue]], who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation, Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive [[Carlsbad Decrees]], designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative governments of the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=A.J.P. |last=Taylor | title=The Course of German History | year=2001 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Decrees terminated the fast-fading nationalist fraternities ({{lang-de|[[Burschenschaft]]en}}), removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press. The decrees began the &quot;persecution of the demagogues&quot;, which was directed against individuals who were accused of spreading revolutionary and nationalist ideas. Among the persecuted were the poet [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]], the publisher Johann Joseph Görres and the &quot;Father of Gymnastics&quot; Ludwig Jahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=George S. |last=Williamson |title= What Killed August von Kotzebue?

[[File:Nationalversammlung.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt 1848]]
In 1834 the [[Zollverein]] was established, a customs union between Prussia and most other German states, but excluding Austria. As industrialisation developed, the need for a unified German state with a uniform currency, legal system, and government became more and more obvious.

====1848====
[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the unsuccessful [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848 in the German states]]]]{{Main|Revolutions of 1848 in the German states}}
Growing discontent with the political and social order imposed by the Congress of Vienna led to the outbreak, in 1848, of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] in the German states. In May the German National Assembly (the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]) met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.

But the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful: [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV of Prussia]] refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850.  Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====1850s====
The 1850s were a period of extreme political reaction. Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholy during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated [[clericalism]] and [[Divine right of kings|absolute divine monarchy]]. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics.  Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.

====Bismarck takes charge, 1862–66====
[[Image:BismarckRoonMoltke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Albrecht Graf von Roon]], [[Helmut von Moltke]], the three leaders of Prussia in the 1860s]]
In 1857, the king had a stroke and his brother [[William I, German Emperor|William]] became regent, then became King William I in 1861. Although conservative, William I was far more pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was naming [[Otto von Bismarck]] as chancellor in 1862. The combination of Bismarck, Defense Minister [[Albrecht von Roon]], and Field Marshal [[Helmut von Moltke]] set the stage for victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, and led to the unification of Germany.  The obstacle to German unification was Austria, and Bismarck solved the problem with a series of wars that united the German states north of Austria.

In 1863–64, disputes between Prussia and Denmark grew over [[Schleswig]], which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The dispute led to the short [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied [[Jutland]]. The Danes were forced to cede both the duchy of Schleswig and the duchy of Holstein to Austria and Prussia. In the aftermath, the management of the two duchies caused escalating tensions between Austria and Prussia. The former wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while the latter wanted to annex them. The [[Seven Weeks War]] between Austria and Germany broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-Koniggratz (Bohemia) in an [[Battle of Königgrätz|enormous battle]] involving half a million men. The Prussian breech-loading [[needle gun]]s carried the day over the slow [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s of the Austrians, who lost a quarter of their army in the battle. Austria ceded [[Venice]] to Italy, but Bismarck was deliberately lenient with the loser to keep alive a long-term alliance with Austria in a subordinate role. Now the French faced an increasingly strong Prussia.

====North German Federation====
{{Main|North German Federation}} [[File:Flag of the German Empire.svg|thumb| Flag of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866–71) and the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). Also used by [[Weimar Republic]] foreign services (1922–33)]]
In 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place the [[North German Federation]] (German ''Norddeutscher Bund'') was established, under the leadership of Prussia. Austria was excluded, and the Austrian influence in Germany that had begun in the 15th century finally came to an end. 

The North German Federation was a transitional organisation that existed from 1867 to 1871, between the dissolution of the German Confederation and the founding of the German Empire.

==German Empire==
[[File:Deutsches Reich1.png|thumb|450px|Imperial Germany 1871–1918]]
{{Main|German Empire}}

===Overview===
After Germany was united by [[Otto von Bismarck]] into the &quot;Second German Reich&quot;, he determined German politics until 1890. Bismarck tried to foster alliances in Europe, on one hand to contain France, and on the other hand to consolidate Germany's influence in Europe.  On the domestic front Bismarck tried to stem the rise of socialism by anti-socialist laws, combined with an introduction of health care and social security. At the same time Bismarck tried to reduce the political influence of the emancipated Catholic minority in the [[Kulturkampf]], literally &quot;culture struggle&quot;.  The Catholics only grew stronger, forming the Center (Zentrum) Party. Germany grew rapidly in industrial and economic power, matching Britain by 1900.  Its highly professional army was the best in the world, but the navy could never catch up with Britain's Royal Navy.

In 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most experienced politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for decades, as well as build a navy that could match the British.  The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal and set the stage for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off [[World War I]].

===Age of Bismarck===
[[File:Reichsgründung1871-AW.jpg|thumb|On 18 January 1871, the German Empire is proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles. Bismarck appears in white.]]

====The new empire====
Disputes between France and Prussia increased. In 1868, the Spanish queen [[Isabella II]] was expelled by a revolution, leaving that country's throne vacant. When Prussia tried to put a Hohenzollern candidate, Prince Leopold, on the Spanish throne, the French angrily protested. In July 1870, France declared war on Prussia (the [[Franco-Prussian War]]). The debacle was swift. A succession of German victories in northeastern France followed, and one French army was besieged at Metz. After a few weeks, the main army was finally forced to capitulate in the [[Battle of Sedan|fortress of Sedan]]. French Emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner and a [[Government of National Defence|republic]] hastily proclaimed in Paris. The new government, realising that a victorious Germany would demand territorial acquisitions, resolved to fight on. They began to muster new armies, and the Germans settled down to a grim siege of Paris. The starving city surrendered in January 1871, and the Prussian army staged a victory parade in it. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5&amp;nbsp;billion francs and cede Alsace-Lorraine. It was a bitter peace that would leave the French thirsting for revenge.

During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]], the German princes assembled in the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]] and proclaimed the Prussian King [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as the &quot;German Emperor&quot; on 18 January 1871.  The German Empire was thus founded,  with the [[Unification of Germany|German states unified]] into a single economic, political, and administrative unit. The empire comprised 25 states, three of which were Hanseatic free cities. It was dubbed the &quot;Little German&quot; solution, since it excluded the Austrian territories and the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburgs]].  Bismarck, again, was appointed to serve as Chancellor. 

The new empire was characterised by a great enthusiasm and vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in imitation of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while it had always been rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that everyone wanted to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.

Bismarck's domestic policies as Chancellor of Germany were characterised by his fight against perceived enemies of the Protestant Prussian state. In the so-called [[Kulturkampf]] (1872–1878), he tried to limit the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and of its political arm, the [[Catholic Centre Party]], through various measures—like the introduction of civil marriage—but without much success. The Kulturkampf antagonised many Protestants as well as Catholics, and was eventually abandoned. Millions of non-Germans subjects in the German Empire, like the Polish, Danish and French minorities, were discriminated against,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=772 | title = A German Voice of Opposition to Germanization (1914) | work = German History in Documents and Images | publisher = German Historical Institute (www.ghi-dc.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=771 | title =Germanization Policy: Speech by Ludwik Jazdzewski in a Session of the Prussian House of Representatives (January 15, 1901) | work = German History in Documents and Images | publisher = German Historical Institute (www.ghi-dc.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a policy of [[Germanisation]] was implemented.

====Classes====
Germany's [[middle class]], based in the cities, grew exponentially,  although it never gained the political power it had in France, Britain or the United States. The Association of German Women's Organizations (BDF) was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia M. |last=Mazón|title=Gender and the Modern Research University: The Admission of Women to German Higher Education, 1865-1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_SKPLZtwulQC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2003|publisher=Stanford U.P.|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the Socialist Workers' Party (later known as the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], SPD), declared its aim to establish  peacefully a new socialist order through the transformation of existing political and social conditions. From 1878, Bismarck tried to repress the social democratic movement by [[Anti-Socialist Laws|outlawing the party's organisation]], its assemblies and most of its newspapers.  When it finally was allowed to run candidates, the Social Democrats were stronger than ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Anthony |last=Moses|title=Trade Unionism in Germany from Bismarck to Hitler, 1869-1933|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yy6oSv2N_iIC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1982|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care, and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern [[European welfare state]]. His paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=E.

====Kulturkampf====
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts the Pope, 1875]]
In 1871–1878, Bismarck launched the &quot;[[Kulturkampf]]&quot; in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in public affairs, and keep the Poles under control. Thousands of priests and bishops were harassed or imprisoned, with large fines and closures of Catholic churches and schools. While the pope did control the selection of bishops, the Catholics supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies, and were angry at his systematic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ayako Bennette, ''Fighting for the Soul of Germany: The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion after Unification'' (Harvard U.P. 2012) &lt;/ref&gt; 

Bismarck sought to appeal to liberals and Protestants but he failed because the Catholics were unanimous in their resistance and organized themselves to fight back politically, using their strength in other states besides Prussia. (The Kulturkampf did not extend to the other German states such as heavily Catholic [[Bavaria]].) German nationalists feared the Polonization of the Prussian East. Bismarck saw the Kulturkampf as a means of stopping this trend, which was led by the Catholic clergy in West Prussia, Poznania and Silesia. The Poles were Catholics and subjected to harassment in the fields of education, occupations, business and public administration. German was declared to be the only official language, but in practice the Poles only adhered more closely to their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard |last=Blanke |title= Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871–1900) | year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little or no violence, but the new Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] won a fourth of the seats in the Reichstag (Imperial Parliament), and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David |last=Blackbourn | title=The Political Alignment of the Centre Party in Wilhelmine Germany: A Study of the Party's Emergence in Nineteenth-Century Württemberg | journal=Historical Journal | volume=18 | issue=4 |date=Dec. 1975 | pages=821–850 | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/2638516}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culture war gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestants, including Bismarck, who was a devout pietistic Protestant. The Catholic anti-liberalism was led by [[Pope Pius IX]]; his death in 1878 allowed Bismarck to open negotiations with [[Pope Leo XIII]], and led to the abandonment of the Kulturkampf in stages in the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Clark | title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947 | year=2006 | pages=568–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|The Triple Alliance (1913-configuration, shown in red) was constructed to isolate France.]]
Bismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was conservative and basically aimed at security and preventing the dreaded scenario of a Franco-Russian alliance, which would trap Germany between the two in a war.

The [[League of Three Emperors]] (''Dreikaisersbund'') was signed in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877–1878, Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|war with the Ottoman Empire]] and attempted to impose the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus Strait]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince. 

In 1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin.  The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia.  Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Italy wanted to defend its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in widespread public demands to give Germany &quot;a place in the sun&quot; through the acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established overseas. In Africa, these were [[Togo]], the [[Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]; in [[Oceania]], they were [[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]. In fact, it was Bismarck himself who helped initiate the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885. He did it to &quot;establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory&quot; (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). This conference was an impetus for the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; and &quot;[[New Imperialism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in &quot;Die Gartenlaube,&quot; 1853–1900 | year=1998 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After annexing the [[Sudetenland]] border country of [[Czechoslovakia]] (October 1938), and taking over the rest of the Czech lands as a protectorate (March 1939), the German Reich and the [[Soviet Union]] invaded Poland on first September 1939 predominantly as part of the Wehrmacht operation codenamed ''[[Fall Weiß (1939)|Fall Weiss]]''.  The invasion of Poland began World War II.

====Bismarck dismissed by new Kaiser====
[[File:1890 Bismarcks Ruecktritt.jpg|thumb|&quot;[[Dropping the Pilot]]&quot; – British caricature depicting Bismarck's dismissal by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in 1890]]
In 1888, the old emperor William I died at the age of 90. His son Frederick III, the hope of German liberals, succeeded him, but was already stricken with throat cancer and died three months later. Frederick's son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] then became emperor at the age of 29. He was the antithesis of old, conservative Germans like Bismarck, addicted to the new imperialism that was taking place in Asia and Africa. Having a left arm withered by childhood polio, he was painfully insecure and desired above all to be loved by the people. He sought to make Germany a great world power with a [[navy]] to rival Britain's. Bismarck hoped to marginalise him just as he had marginalised his grandfather, but William II desired to be his own master. Bismarck's schemes to dominate the emperor and hold onto his own power failed, and he was forced to resign in March 1890.

===Wilhelminian Era===

====Alliances and diplomacy====
{{Main|Triple Alliance (1882)}}
The young [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] sought aggressively to increasing Germany's influence in the world (''[[Weltpolitik]]''). After the removal of Bismarck, foreign policy was in the hands of the erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly reckless hand,&lt;ref&gt;On the Kaiser's &quot;histrionic personality disorder&quot;, see Tipton (2003), Pp. 243–45&lt;/ref&gt; and the powerful foreign office under the leadership of [[Friedrich von Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=J.C.G. |last=Röhl | title=Friedrich von Holstein | journal=Historical Journal | date=Sept 1966 | volume=9 |issue=3 | pages=379–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foreign office argued that: first, a long-term coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart; secondly, Russia and Britain would never get together; and, finally, Britain would eventually seek an alliance with Germany. Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia. But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression.  Furthermore, Anglo–German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a [[World War I naval arms race|naval race]] with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought.  Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides.&lt;ref name=raff&gt;{{citation | first=Diethher |last=Raff | title=History of Germany from the Medieval Empire to the Present | year=1988 | pages=34–55, 202–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile the German Navy under Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] had ambitions to rival the great British Navy, and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies and exert power worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David |last=Woodward | title=Admiral Tirpitz, Secretary of State for the Navy, 1897–1916 | journal=History Today | date=July 1963 | volume=13  |issue=8 | pages=548–555}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction in 1898. In 1890, Germany had gained the island of [[Heligoland]] in the North Sea from Britain in exchange for the eastern African island of [[Zanzibar]], and proceeded to construct a great naval base there. This posed a direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The British, however, kept well ahead in the [[World War I naval arms race|naval race]] by the introduction of the highly advanced new ''[[Dreadnought]]'' battleship in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Holger | last=Herwig | title=Luxury Fleet: The Imperial German Navy 1888–1918 | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Raymond A. |last=Esthus | title=Theodore Roosevelt and the International Rivalries | year=1970 | pages=66–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis]] of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco, which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912.

====Economy====
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], 1881]]
The economy continued to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry – especially coal and steel – becoming important in the Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia.  Perkins (1981) argues that more important than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914.  Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=J.A. | last=Perkins | title=The Agricultural Revolution in Germany 1850–1914 | journal = Journal of European Economic History | date=Spring 1981 | volume=10 | issue=1 |pages=71–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Hoeniger Spittelmarkt 1912.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Berlin in 1912]]
Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century.  At first, the production of dyes was critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Ludwig Fritz |last=Haber | title=The chemical industry during the nineteenth century | year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany became Europe's leading steel-producing nation in the 1890s, thanks in large part to the protection from American and British competition afforded by tariffs and cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Steven B. |last=Webb | title=Tariffs, Cartels, Technology, and Growth in the German Steel Industry, 1879 to 1914 | journal=Journal of Economic History | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=June 1980 | pages=309–330 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2120181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading firm was &quot;Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp,&quot; run by the [[Krupp|Krupp family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Harold | last=James | title=Krupp: A History of the Legendary German Firm | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The merger of several major firms into the ''Vereinigte Stahlwerke'' (United Steel Works) in 1926 was modeled on the [[U.S. Steel]] corporation in the United States. The new company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return-on-investment as its measure of success. By 1913, American and German exports dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert C. |last=Allen | title=International Competition in Iron and Steel, 1850–1913 | journal=Journal of Economic History | date=Dec 1979 | volume = 39 | issue=4| pages=911–37 | url =http://www.jstor.org/stable/2120336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In machinery, iron and steel, and other industries, German firms avoided cut-throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a world leader because of its prevailing &quot;corporatist mentality&quot;, its strong bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government.  These associations regulate competition and allowed small firms to function in the shadow of much larger companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Gerald D. |last=Feldman | first2=Ulrich |last2=Nocken | title=Trade Associations and Economic Power: Interest Group Development in the German Iron and Steel and Machine Building Industries, 1900–1933 | journal=Business History Review | date=Winter 1975 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=413–45 | url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/3113169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colonies====
{{Main|German colonial empire}}
[[File:German colonial lord.jpg|thumb|A colonial lord in the German colony [[Togoland]] (ca. 1885)]]

In the course of ongoing imperialistic aspirations in all European great powers, a general tendency towards colonial imperialism also existed in the German states since ca. 1848. As part of the &quot;[[Weltpolitik]]&quot; (''global policy''), the German Empire demanded its &quot;Platz an der Sonne&quot; (''Place in the sun'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Matthew |last=Fitzpatrick | title=A Fall from Grace?

The construction of the [[Baghdad Railway]], financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the [[Persian Gulf]], but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests.  The largest colonial enterprises were in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Gann, L., and Peter Duignan, ''The Rulers of German Africa, 1884–1914'' (1977) focuses on political and economic history; Perraudin, Michael, and Jürgen Zimmerer, eds.

====Causes====
Ethnic demands for nation states upset the balance between the empires that dominated Europe, [[causes of World War I|leading to World War I]], which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, comprised chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy. 

In explaining why neutral Britain went to war  with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France (pp.&amp;nbsp;457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 — when Prussia and the German states smashed France — would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860–1914 | year=1980 | pages=464–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Front====
In the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin's diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the [[Marne]], north of Paris. 

The [[Western Front]] became an extremely bloody battleground of [[trench warfare]]. The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the [[North Sea]] which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany's overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.M. |last=Winter | title=Capital Cities at War: Paris, London, Berlin, 1914–1919 | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the United States into the war – following Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare – marked a decisive turning-point against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hew | last=Strachan | title=The First World War | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Front====
More wide open was the fighting on the [[Eastern Front]]. In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces – exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] – led to an imposed peace and the favorable [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war.

====1918====
[[File:Waffenstillstand gr.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[Armistice with Germany]] in Compiègne, 1918]]

By defeating Russia in 1917 Germany was able to bring hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies.  By retraining the soldiers in new storm-trooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the Battlefield and win a decisive victory before the American army arrived in strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Holger H.  |last=Herwig | title=The First World War: Germany and Austria–Hungary 1914–1918 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the spring offensives all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped, and the Germans lacked the reserves necessary to consolidate their gains. In the summer, with the Americans arriving at 10,000 a day, and the German reserves exhausted, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offenses destroyed the German army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Rod | last=Paschall | title=The defeat of imperial Germany, 1917–1918 | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the &quot;turnip winter,&quot; because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roger | last=Chickering | title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914–1918 | year=2004 | pages=141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.

The end of October 1918, in [[Kiel]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic. 

On 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|the Compiègne armistice]] was signed, ending the war. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on 28 June 1919. Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmédy, [[Northern Schleswig|North Schleswig]], and the [[Klaipėda|Memel]] area. All German colonies were to be handed over to the British and French. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], and some areas of [[Upper Silesia]] were reincorporated into the reformed country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. The left and right banks of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important [[Saarland]] was to be governed by the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years and its coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to determine the Saar's future status. To ensure execution of the treaty's terms, Allied troops would occupy the left (German) bank of the Rhine for a period of 5–15 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men; the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany and its allies were to accept the sole responsibility of the war, in accordance with the [[War Guilt Clause]], and were to pay financial reparations for all loss and damage suffered by the Allies.

1918 was also the year of the deadly [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish Flu pandemic]] which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.

===Overview===
The humiliating peace terms in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The greatest enemies of democracy had already been constituted. In December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new republic. [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1919 took control of the new [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), which failed in a [[Beer Hall Putsch|coup in Munich in 1923]]. Both parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis, with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933–1945; the KPD, with a mostly urban and working class base, came to power (in the East) in 1945–1989.&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison see Timothy S.

===The early years===
On 11 August 1919 the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution came into effect, with [[Friedrich Ebert]] as first President.

On 30 December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] was founded by the [[Spartacus League]], who had split from the Social Democratic Party during the war. It was headed by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000 members from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] joined the party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a following of about 10% of the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|title=The political parties in the Weimar Republic|url=http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first months of 1920, the [[Reichswehr]] was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. This included the dissolution of many [[Freikorps]] – units made up of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup d'état in March 1920, the [[Kapp Putsch]], extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup d'état collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions, which were bloodily suppressed.

Faced with animosity from Britain and France and the retreat of American power from Europe, in 1922 Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.

When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].

In September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November, his government introduced a new currency, the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]] (later: [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]), together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germany's industrial production even regained the pre-war levels of 1913.

The national elections of 1924 led to a swing to the right. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was [[German presidential election, 1925|elected]] President in 1925.

In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.

===Economic collapse and political problems, 1929–1933===
The [[stock market crash]] of 1929 on [[Wall Street]] marked the beginning of the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the ''Darmstätter und Nationalbank'' – one of the biggest German banks – failed. In early 1932, the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000.

On top of the collapsing economy came a political crisis:  the political parties represented in the Reichstag were unable to build a governing majority in the face of escalating extremism from the far right (the Nazis, NSDAP) and the far left (the Communists, KPD). In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed [[Heinrich Brüning]] Chancellor. To push through his package of austerity measures against a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP (Nazis), Brüning made use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament.  In March and April 1932, Hindenburg was re-elected in the [[German presidential election, 1932|German presidential election of 1932]].

The NSDAP was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 the NSDAP had received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the Reichstag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/innenpolitik/nsdap/index.html | title = Die Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP) (The National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP))}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist KPD came third, with 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=
http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Deutschland/Uebersicht_RTW.html | title = ''Das Deutsche Reich Reichstagswahlen 1919–1933'' (Weimar Republic Results of Elections 1919–1933)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the anti-democratic parties of far right and far left were now able to hold the majority of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point with each other, fighting it out in the streets. The NSDAP was particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (lower middle class) which had lost its assets in the hyperinflation of 1923, and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.

===Science and culture===
{{Main|Science and technology in Germany}}
The Weimar years saw a flowering of German science and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.
German recipients dominated the [[Nobel laureates by country|Nobel prizes in science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://nobelprize.org/ | title = Nobel Prize | publisher= Nobelprize.org |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]], [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]],  [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Max Planck]]  and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Chemistry likewise was dominated by German professors and researchers at the great chemical companies such as [[BASF]] and [[Bayer]] and persons like [[Fritz Haber]].  Theoretical mathematicians included [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in the 19th century and [[David Hilbert]] in the 20th century. [[Carl Benz]], the inventor of the automobile, was one of the pivotal figures of engineering.

Among the most important German writers were [[Thomas Mann]] (1875–1955), [[Hermann Hesse]] (1877–1962) and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1898–1956). The pessimistic historian [[Oswald Spengler]] wrote ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (198–23) on the inevitable decay of Western Civilization, and influenced intellectuals in Germany such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Max Scheler]], and the [[Frankfurt School]], as well as intellectuals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James |last=Joll |title=Two Prophets of the Twentieth Century: Spengler and Toynbee | journal = Review of International Studies | date=April 1985 |volume=11 |Issue =2 | pages=91–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1933, Nazi proponents of &quot;Aryan physics,&quot; led by the Nobel Prize-winners [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Philipp Lenard]], attacked Einstein's theory of relativity as a degenerate example of Jewish materialism in the realm of science.  Many scientists and humanists emigrated; Einstein moved permanently to the U.S. but some of the others returned after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roderick |last=Stackelberg |title=The Routledge companion to Nazi Germany | year=2007 | page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Mitchell G. |editor-last=Ash |editor2-first=Alfons |editor2-last=Söllner |title=Forced Migration and Scientific Change: Emigré German-Speaking Scientists and Scholars after 1933 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:NS administrative Gliederung 1944.png|thumb|450px|''Nazi Germany'' in 1944]] This is a map of the internal structure of the NSDAP, not that of Germany. --&gt;
The Nazi regime restored economic prosperity and ended mass unemployment using heavy spending on the military, while suppressing labor unions and strikes. The return of prosperity gave the [[Nazi Party]] enormous popularity, with only minor, isolated and subsequently unsuccessful cases of [[German resistance|resistance among the German population]] over the 12 years of rule. The [[Gestapo]] (secret police) under [[Heinrich Himmler]] destroyed the political opposition and persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile, while taking their property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches.  All expressions of public opinion were controlled by Hitler's propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic speaking.  The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its Führer (leader), putting all powers in his hands. Nazi propaganda centered on Hitler and was quite effective in creating what historians called the &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;—that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Kershaw | title=The &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;: Image and Reality in the Third Reich | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whomever had his ear.  All top officials reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies, but they had considerable autonomy on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Williamson | title=Was Hitler a Weak Dictator? | journal=History Review | year=2002 |pages=9+ |url = http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5000710589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the Nazi regime===
In order to secure a majority for his NSDAP in the Reichstag, Hitler called for new elections. On the evening of 27 February 1933, a [[Reichstag fire|fire]] was set in the Reichstag building. Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and convinced President Hindenburg to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. This decree, which would remain in force until 1945, repealed important political and human rights of the Weimar constitution. Communist agitation was banned, but at this time not the Communist Party itself.

Eleven thousand Communists and Socialists were arrested and brought into hastily prepared [[concentration camp]]s such as [[Kemna concentration camp]], where they were at the mercy of the [[Gestapo]], the newly established secret police force (9,000 were found guilty and most executed). Communist Reichstag deputies were taken into [[protective custody]] (despite their constitutional privileges).

Despite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to bring the majority for the NSDAP that Hitler had hoped for. Together with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), however, he was able to form a slim majority government. With accommodations to the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], Hitler succeeded in convincing a required two-thirds of a rigged Parliament to pass the [[Enabling act of 1933]] which gave his government full legislative power. Only the Social Democrats voted against the Act. The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the [[States of Germany|Länder]]; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution. Germany left the [[League of Nations]]. The coalition parliament was rigged on this fateful 23 March 1933 by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a ''quid pro quo'' with the [[Holy See|Pope]] under the ''anti-communist'' [[Pope Pius XI]] for the [[Reichskonkordat]]; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. It is interesting to note, however, that according to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Dick | last=Geary | title=Who voted for the Nazis? (electoral history of the National Socialist German Workers Party) | journal= History Today | date= October 1998 | volume=48 | issue= 10 | pages=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist Party was proscribed in April 1933. On the weekend of 30 June 1934, he gave order to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] to seize Röhm and his lieutenants, and to execute them without trial (known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]]). Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).

[[File:Hitler, Göring, Goebbels and Hess.jpg|thumb|Some of the leaders of the Nazi regime (left to right): [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Rudolf Hess]]]]
However, many leaders of the Nazi SA were disappointed. The Chief of Staff of the SA, [[Ernst Röhm]], was pressing for the SA to be incorporated into the army.  Hitler had long been at odds with Röhm and felt increasingly threatened by these plans and in the &quot;[[Night of the Long Knives]]&quot; in 1934 killed Röhm and the top SA leaders using their notorious homosexuality as an excuse.&lt;ref&gt;CCcite journal | first=David |last=Jablonsky | title=Rohm and Hitler: The Continuity of Political-Military Discord | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume=23 | issue=3 |date=July 1988 | pages=367–386 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/260688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SS became an independent organisation under the command of the ''Reichsführer SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]]. He would become the supervisor of the ''[[Gestapo]]'' and of the concentration camps, soon also of the ordinary police. Hitler also established the [[Waffen-SS]] as a separate troop.

===Jews===

[[File:Judenstern JMW.jpg|thumb|left| [[Yellow badge]] required to be worn by all Jews in Germany and occupied countries beginning in 1939.]]
The regime showed particular hostility towards the Jews, which were the target of unending propaganda attacks. In 1933 all Jewish civil servants and academics were fired.  In September 1935, the Reichstag passed the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nuremberg race laws]]. Jews lost their German citizenship, and were banned from marrying non-Jewish Germans. About 500,000 individuals were affected by the new rules.  About half of Germany's 500,000 Jews fled before 1939, after which escape became almost impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Saul | last=Friedlander | title=Nazi Germany and the Jews | volume =1: The Years of Persecution 1933–1939 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P017073, Berlin, Olympische Spiele im Olympiastadion.jpg|thumb|The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin – a great propaganda success for the Nazi regime]]
Hitler re-established the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force) and reintroduced universal military service. This was in breach of the Treaty of Versailles; Britain, France or Italy issued notes of protest. Hitler had the officers swear their personal allegiance to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alan |last=Bullock |title=Hitler: a study in tyranny | year=1991 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936 German troops [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|marched into the demilitarised Rhineland]]. Britain and France did not intervene.  The move strengthened Hitler's standing in Germany. His reputation swelled  further with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], which were held in the same year in Berlin, and which proved another great propaganda success for the regime as orchestrated by master propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Toby |last=Thacker |title = Joseph Goebbels: Life and Death | year=2009 | pages=182–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
Historians have  paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renate |last=Bridenthal |first2=Atina |last2=Grossmann | first3=Marion |last3=Kaplan | title=When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances.  Theoretically the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jill |last=Stephenson | title=Women in Nazi Germany |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Hundreds of thousands of women served in the military as nurses, and support personnel, and another  hundred thousand served in the Luftwaffe helping to operate the anti—aircraft systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=D'Ann |last=Campbell | title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union | journal = Journal of Military History | date=April 1993 | volume =57 |pages =301–323 | url = http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Claudia |last=Koonz | title=Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
[[File:1938 Naka yoshi sangoku.jpg|145px|thumb|left|Japanese poster promoting the [[Axis Powers|Axis cooperation]] in 1938]]
Hitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (&quot;axis&quot;) with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and [[World War II]] began – somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.

After establishing the &quot;Rome-Berlin axis&quot; with [[Benito Mussolini]], and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Japan – which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937 – Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&amp;nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovak]]s and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaipėda Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of [[appeasement]] towards Hitler had failed.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-04413, KZ Auschwitz, Einfahrt.jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[extermination camp]] [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]]]
In six years, the Nazi regime prepared the country for World War II. The Nazi leadership attempted to remove or subjugate the Jewish population of Nazi Germany and later in the occupied countries through forced deportation and, ultimately, [[genocide]] now known as the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. A similar policy applied to the various ethnic and national groups considered [[Untermensch|subhuman]] such as [[Poles]], [[Romani people|Roma]] or [[Russians]]. These groups were seen as threats to the purity of Germany's [[Aryan]] race. There were also many groups, such as [[homosexuals]], the mentally handicapped and those who were physically challenged from birth, which were singled out as being detrimental to Aryan purity.

===World War II===
{{Main|World War II}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 116-168-618, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Soldat mit MPi.jpg|thumb|A German soldier during the decisive [[Battle of Stalingrad]]]]
At first Germany's military moves were brilliantly successful, as in the &quot;[[blitzkrieg]]&quot; invasions of [[Poland]] (1939), [[Norway]] (1940), the [[Low Countries]] (1940), and above all the stunningly successful invasion and quick conquest of [[Battle of France|France]] in 1940. Hitler probably wanted peace with Britain in late 1940, but Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], standing alone, was dogged in his defiance. Churchill had major financial, military, and diplomatic help from President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the U.S., another implacable foe of Hitler.  Hitler's emphasis on maintaining high living standards postponed the full mobilization of the national economy until 1942, years after the great rivals Britain, Russia, and the U.S. had fully mobilized. Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941&amp;nbsp;– weeks behind schedule&amp;nbsp;– but swept forward until it reached the gates of Moscow.

The tide turned in December 1941, when the invasion of Russia stalled in cold weather and the United States joined the war. After surrender in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] and losing the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942–43, the Germans were on the defensive. By late 1944, the United States, Canada, France, and Great Britain were closing in on Germany in the West, while the Soviets were closing from the East. Nazi Germany collapsed as Berlin was taken by the Red Army in a fight to the death on the city streets. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945. Final German surrender was signed on 8 May 1945.

By September 1945, the [[Third Reich]] (which lasted only 12 years) and its [[Axis Powers|Axis]] partners (Italy and Japan) had been defeated, chiefly by the forces of the [[Soviet Union]], the United States, and the United Kingdom. Much of Europe lay in ruins, over 60 million people had been killed (most of them civilians), including approximately 6 million Jews and 5 million non-Jews in what became known as the [[Holocaust]]. World War II resulted in the destruction of Germany's political and economic infrastructure and led directly to its partition, considerable loss of territory (especially in the east), and historical legacy of guilt and shame.

[[File:Germanborders.svg|thumb|Territorial losses of modern Germany 1919–1945]]
As a consequence of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and the onset of the [[Cold War]] in 1947, the country was split between the two global blocs in the East and West, a period known as the division of Germany. Millions of refugees from Central and Eastern Europe moved west, most of them to West Germany. Two states emerged: [[West Germany]] was a parliamentary democracy, a [[NATO]] member, a founding member of what since became the [[European Union]] and one of the world's largest economies, while [[East Germany]] was a totalitarian Communist dictatorship that was a satellite of Moscow. With the collapse of Communism in 1989, [[Reunification of Germany|reunion on West Germany's terms followed.]]

No one doubted Germany's economic and engineering prowess; the question was how long bitter memories of the war would cause Europeans to distrust Germany, and whether Germany could demonstrate it had rejected totalitarianism and militarism and embraced democracy and human rights.

The total of [[World War II casualties#Third Reich|German war dead]] was 8% to 10% out of a prewar population of 69,000,000, or between 5.5 million and 7 million people.  This included 4.5 million in the military, and between 1 and 2 million civilians. There was chaos as 11 million foreign workers and POWs left, while 14 million displaced refugees from the east and soldiers returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Bessel |title=Germany 1945: From War to Peace | publisher=Harper Collins Publishers | year=2009 |ISBN=978-0-06-054036-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|Occupation zone borders after 1945. Berlin, although within the Soviet zone, was also divided among the four powers. The areas in white to the east were given to Poland and the Soviet Union (now Russia)]]
At the [[Potsdam Conference]], Germany was [[Partitions of Germany|divided into four military occupation zones]] by the Allies and did not regain independence until 1949. The provinces east of the Oder and Neisse rivers (the [[Oder-Neisse line]]) were transferred to Poland, Lithuania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Potsdam Declaration | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450802a.html | publisher = Book Department, Army Information School | location=Carlisle Barracks, Pa. | date= May 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia ([[Kaliningrad oblast]]); the 6.7 million Germans living in Poland and the 2.5 million in Czechoslovakia were forced to move west, although most had already left when the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Joseph B. |last=Schechtman | title=Postwar Population Transfers in Europe: A Survey | journal=Review of Politics | volume=15 | issue=2 |date=April 1953 |pages=151–178}}. &quot;Most had left&quot; is p. 158 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405220 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denazification]] removed, imprisoned, or executed most top officials of the old regime, but most middle and lower ranks of civilian officialdom were not seriously affected. In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the [[Yalta conference]] millions of POWs were used as [[Foreign forced labor in the Soviet Union|forced labor]] by the Soviet Union and other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Eugene | last=Davidson | title=The death and life of Germany: an account of the American occupation | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, the Soviets crushed dissent and imposed another police state, often employing ex-Nazis in the dreaded [[Stasi]].  The Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German GNP for reparations, while in the West reparations were a minor factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter |last=Liberman | title=Does Conquest Pay?  The Exploitation of Occupied Industrial Societies | year=1996 | page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945–46 housing and food conditions were bad, as the disruption of transport, markets, and finances slowed a return to normal. In the West,  bombing had destroyed the fourth of the housing stock,&lt;ref&gt;2.3 million units out of 9.5 million were destroyed.&lt;/ref&gt; and over 10 million refugees from the east had crowded in, most living in camps.&lt;ref name=tipton&gt;{{cite book | first=Frank B. |last=Tipton | title=A History of Modern Germany since 1815 | year=2003 | pages=508–513, 596–599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food production in 1946–48 was only two-thirds of the prewar level, while grain and meat shipments – which usually supplied 25% of the food – no longer arrived from the East. Furthermore, the end of the war brought the end of large shipments of food seized from occupied nations that had sustained Germany during the war. Coal production was down 60%, which had cascading negative effects on railroads, heavy industry, and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Calvin B. |last=Hoover |title=The Future of the German Economy | journal=American Economic Review | volume=36 | issue=2 |date=May 1946 | pages=642–649 | url =http://www.jstor.org/stable/1818235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production fell more than half and reached prewar levels only at the end of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alan S. |last=Milward |title=The Reconstruction of Western Europe: 1945–51 | year=1984 | pages=356, 436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied economic policy originally was one of [[Industrial plans for Germany|industrial disarmament]] plus building the agricultural sector. In the western sectors, most of the industrial plants had minimal bomb damage and the Allies dismantled 5% of the industrial plants for reparations.&lt;ref name=ardagh&gt;{{cite book | first=John |last=Ardagh | title=Germany and the Germans | year=1987 | pages=74–82, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, deindustrialization became impractical and the U.S. instead called for a strong industrial base in Germany so it could stimulate European economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Frederick H. | last=Gareau | title=Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany | journal =Western Political Quarterly |volume=14 |issue=2 |date=Jun. 1961 | pages=517–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. shipped food in 1945–47 and made a $600 million loan in 1947 to rebuild German industry.  By May 1946 the removal of machinery had ended, thanks to lobbying by the U.S. Army. The Truman administration finally realised that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent. Washington decided that an &quot;orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html | title=Conferences: Pas de Pagaille! | newspaper =Time | date= 28 July 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For US and Allied official policy statements see U.S. Dept. of State ''Germany, 1947–1949: The Story in Documents'' (1950) - available [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=16323505 online]; these are primary sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Germany (GDR)===

In 1949 the Soviet zone became the &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot; – &quot;DDR&quot; (&quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; – &quot;GDR&quot;, simply often &quot;East Germany&quot;), under control of the German Communist Party. Neither country had a significant army until the 1950s, but East Germany built the [[Stasi]] into a powerful secret police that infiltrated every aspect of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Gary |last=Bruce |title=The Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control of the Soviet Union through her occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty]]. Political power was solely executed by leading members (''[[Politburo]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED).  A Soviet-style [[command economy]] was set up; later the GDR became the most advanced [[Comecon]] state. While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mary |last=Fulbrook |title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Ulbricht]] (1893–1973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin.  As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Johanna |last=Granville |title=East Germany in 1956: Walter Ulbricht's Tenacity in the Face of Opposition | journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History | date=Sept 2006 |volume=52 | issue=3 |pages=417–438}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the [[Berlin Wall]] to stop them — shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protective Wall&quot; was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Joseph A. |last=Biesinger |title=Germany: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present |year=2006 | page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Frederick | last=Taylor | title=The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961–1989 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969–70, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht's détente policies toward the West. 

The transition to [[Erich Honecker]] ([[Leadership of East Germany|General Secretary]] from 1971 to 1989) led to a change in the direction of national policy and efforts by the Politburo to pay closer attention to the grievances of the proletariat. [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]]'s plans were not successful, however, with the dissent growing among East Germany's population. 

In 1989, the socialist regime collapsed after 40 years, despite its omnipresent secret police, the [[Stasi]]. Main reasons for the collapse include severe economic problems and growing emigration towards the West.

East Germany's culture was shaped by Communism and particularly Stalinism. It was characterized by East German psychoanalyst Hans-Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a &quot;Congested Feeling&quot; among Germans in the East as a result of Communist policies criminalizing personal expression that deviates from government approved ideals, and through the enforcement of Communist principals by physical force and intellectual repression by government agencies, particularly the Stasi.&lt;ref name=pence-betts&gt;{{cite book | first=Katherine |last=Pence | first2=Paul |last2=Betts | title=Socialist modern: East German everyday culture and politics | edition=4 | publisher = University of Michigan Press |year=2011| pages=37, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the East German state have claimed that the state's commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool of a ruling elite. This argument has been challenged by some scholars who claim that the Party was committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, the vast majority regarded the state's Communist ideals to be a nothing more than a deceptive method for government control.&lt;ref name=pence-betts/&gt;

According to German historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] (2010):
:''Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies. Massive evidence has been collected that proves the repressive, undemocratic, illiberal, nonpluralistic character of the GDR regime and its ruling party.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jürgen Kocka|title=Civil Society and Dictatorship in Modern German History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j8mo4uP3SQMC&amp;pg=PA37|year= 2010|publisher=UPNE|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Germany===
[[File:Flag of Germany (3-2 aspect ratio).svg|thumb|upright| Flag of West Germany and unified Germany,&lt;br&gt;1949 – present]]
{{Main|West Germany}}

In 1949, the three western [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] (American, British, and French) were combined into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany). The government was formed under Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] and his conservative CDU/CSU coalition.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] or CSU is the Bavaria branch of the CDU. It has always operated in close collaboration with the CDU, and the CDU/CSU is usually treated as a single party in national affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; The CDU/CSU was in power during most of the period since 1949. The capital was [[Bonn]] until it was moved to Berlin in 1990. In 1990 FRG absorbed East Germany and gained full sovereignty over Berlin.  At all points West Germany was much larger and richer that East Germany, which became a dictatorship under the control of the Communist Party and was closely monitored by Moscow. Germany, especially Berlin, was a cockpit of the [[Cold War]], with NATO and the Warsaw Pact assembling major military forces in west and east. However there was never any combat.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Weber, ''Germany, 1945-1990: A Parallel History'' (Budapest, Central European University Press, 2004) [http://www.questia.com/library/118943266/germany-1945-1990-a-parallel-history in Questia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic miracle ====
[[File:1000000th beatle.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was an icon of West German reconstruction.]]
West Germany enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' or &quot;Economic Miracle&quot;).&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite book | first=Jurgen |last=Weber | title=Germany, 1945–1990 | publisher=Central European University Press | year=2004 | pages= 37–60, 103–18, 167–88, 221–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross  national product grew at a rate of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of Western Europe.  Labor union supported the new policies with postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, support for technological modernization, and a policy of [[co-determination]] (''Mitbestimmung''), which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system as well as requiring representation of workers on the boards of large corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Friedrich | last=Fürstenberg | title=West German Experience with Industrial Democracy | journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume=431 |date=May 1977 | pages=44–53 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1042033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recovery was accelerated by the [[D-Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|currency reform of June 1948]], U.S. gifts of $1.4 billion as part of the [[Marshall Plan]],  the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-first=Detlef |editor-last=Junker | title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945–1968 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2004 | volume=1 | pages=291–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  West Germany  gained legitimacy  and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis.

West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1958.

====1948 currency reform====
The most dramatic and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Heinz |last = Sauermann | title=The Consequences of the Currency Reform in Western Germany | journal = Review of Politics | year=1950 | volume = 12 | number =2 | pages=175–196 | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful.  That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially.  On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new [[Deutsche Mark]] at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings.  Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices.  The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy.  The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.

[[File:C-54landingattemplehof.jpg|thumb|Berliners watching a transport bringing food and coal during the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948–49]]
In addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market.  Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports.  Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.&lt;ref name=tipton /&gt;

The success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and [[West Berlin]].  This was the [[Berlin Blockade]], which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well.  The city thereby became economically integrated into West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=D.

====Adenauer====
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Adenauer in 1952; he forged close ties with France and the U.S. and opposed the Soviet Union and its satellite of East Germany]]
[[Konrad Adenauer]] (1876–1967) was the dominant leader in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles |last=Williams | title=Konrad Adenauer: The Father of the New Germany | year=2000 | url= http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=106754987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the first chancellor (top official) of the FRG, 1949–63, and until his death was the founder and leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a coalition of conservatives, [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberals]], and adherents of Protestant and [[Catholic social teaching]] that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging [[European Union]], established the country's armed forces (the ''[[Bundeswehr]]''), and became a pillar of [[NATO]] as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauer's government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and [[Israel]] after the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard |last=Hiscocks | title=The Adenauer era | year=1975 |page= 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Erhard====
[[Ludwig Erhard]] (1897–1977) was in charge of economic policy as economics director for the British and American occupation zones and was Adenauer's long-time economics minister. Erhard's decision to lift many price controls in 1948 (despite opposition from both the social democratic opposition and Allied authorities), plus his advocacy of free markets, helped set the Federal Republic on its strong growth from wartime devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ronald J. |last=Granieri | title=Review | journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History | volume=36 | number =2 | year=2005 | pages=262, 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norbert Walter, a former chief economist at [[Deutsche Bank]], argues that &quot;Germany owes its rapid economic advance after World War II to the system of the Social Market Economy, established by Ludwig Erhard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Norbert |last=Walter | title=The Evolving German Economy: Unification, the Social Market, European and Global Integration | journal=SAIS Review | issue=15 (Special Issue 1995) |pages=55–81}}. Quote from p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alfred C.  |last=Mierzejewski | title=Ludwig Erhard: a biography | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was politically less successful when he served as the CDU Chancellor from 1963 until 1966. Erhard followed the concept of a [[social market economy]], and was in close touch with professional economists.  Erhard viewed the market itself as social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free, competitive economy in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a conventional west European welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Alfred C. |last=Mierzejewski |title=1957: Ludwig Erhard's Annus Terribilis |journal=Essays in Economic and Business History |year=2004 |volume=22 |pages=17–27 |issn=0896-226X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile in adopting the [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) largely abandoned Marxism ideas and embraced the concept of the [[market economy]] and the welfare state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to appeal the full spectrum of potential voters, including the middle class and professionals. Labor unions [[Social corporatism|cooperated]] increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Henry Ashby |last=Turner |title=The two Germanies since 1945 | year=1987 | pages=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grand coalition====

In 1966 Erhard lost support and [[Kurt Kiesinger]] (1904–1988) was elected as Chancellor by a new CDU/CSU-[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] alliance combining the two largest parties. Socialist (SPD) leader [[Willy Brandt]] was Deputy Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The Grand Coalition lasted 1966–69 and is best known for reducing tensions with the Soviet bloc nations and establishing diplomatic relations with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

====Guest workers====
{{main|Gastarbeiter}}
With a booming economy short of unskilled workers, especially after the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated migration agreements with Italy (1955), Spain (1960), Greece (1960), and Turkey (1961) that brought in hundreds of thousands of temporary guest workers, called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]''.  In 1968 the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia that employed additional guest workers.  ''Gastarbeiter'' were young men who were paid full-scale wages and benefits, but were expected to return home in a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kaja |last=Shonick | title=Politics, Culture, and Economics: Reassessing the West German Guest Worker Agreement with Yugoslavia | journal=Journal of Contemporary History | date=Oct 2009 | volume=44 |Issue=4 |pages=719–736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because there were few good jobs in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Stephen |last=Castles |title=The Guests Who Stayed – The Debate on 'Foreigners Policy' in the German Federal Republic | journal=International Migration Review | volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=517–534 |url =http://www.jstor.org/stable/2545854}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 there were about 4 million people of Turkish descent in Germany.

[[Willy Brandt]] (1913–1992) was the leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in 1964–87 and West German Chancellor in 1969–1974. Under his leadership, the German government sought to reduce tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] and improve relations with the [[German Democratic Republic]], a policy known as the ''[[Ostpolitik]]''.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; Relations between the two German states had been icy at best, with propaganda barrages in each direction. The heavy outflow of talent from East Germany prompted the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, which worsened [[Cold War]] tensions and prevented East Germans from travel. Although anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, Brandt's ''Ostpolitik'' was intent on holding to its concept of &quot;two German states in one German nation.&quot;

''Ostpolitik'' was opposed by the conservative elements in Germany, but won Brandt an international reputation and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Carole |editor-last=Fink |editor2-first=Bernd |editor2-last=Schaefer | title=Ostpolitik, 1969–1974: European and Global Responses | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the [[United Nations]]. The two countries exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East Germany's leader [[Erich Honecker]] paid an official state visit to West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mary |last=Fulbrook | title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation | year=2002 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic crisis of 1970s====
{{see also|Steel crisis}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051012-0010, Bonn, Empfang Staatspräsident von Frankreich.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helmut Schmidt]], left, with French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1977)]]
After 1973, Germany was hard hit by a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975.  The [[Ruhr]] region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive.  Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduce their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved into service industries and high technology.  Cleaning up  the heavy air and water pollution  became a major industry in its own right.  Meanwhile,  formerly rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry.&lt;ref name=ardagh/&gt;

A spy scandal forced Brandt to step down as Chancellor while remaining as party leader. He was replaced by [[Helmut Schmidt]] (b. 1918), of the SPD, who served as Chancellor in 1974–1982. Schmidt continued the ''Ostpolitik'' with less enthusiasm. He had a [[PhD]] in economics and was more interested in domestic issues, such as reducing [[inflation]]. The debt grew rapidly as he borrowed to cover the cost of the ever more expensive welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hans-Werner |last=Sinn |title=Can Germany be saved?: the malaise of the world's first welfare state | publisher=MIT Press | year=2007 | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1979, foreign policy issues grew central as the Cold War turned hot again. The German peace movement mobilized hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to protest against American deployment in Europe of new [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s. Schmidt supported the deployment but was opposed by the left wing of the SPD and by Brandt.

The pro-business [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party (FDP)]] had been in coalition with the SPD, but now it changed direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Karl H. |last=Cerny |title=Germany at the polls: the Bundestag elections of the 1980s | year=1990 | page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Led by Finance Minister [[Otto Graf Lambsdorff]] (1926–2009) the FDP adopted the market-oriented &quot;Kiel Theses&quot; in 1977; it rejected the Keynesian emphasis on consumer demand, and proposed to reduce social welfare spending, and try to introduce policies to stimulate production and facilitate jobs. Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems.  As a consequence, the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982. For the only time in West Germany's history, the government fell on a [[vote of no confidence]].&lt;ref name=tipton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a primary source see Helmut Schmidt, '' Men and Power: A Political Retrospective'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kohl===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021, Bonn, Pressekonferenz Bundestagswahlkampf, Kohl.jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] became first chancellor of a reunified Germany.]]
[[Helmut Kohl]] (b. 1930) brought the conservatives back to power with a [[Cabinet Kohl I|CDU/CSU-FDP coalition]] in 1982, and served as Chancellor until 1998.&lt;ref name=weber /&gt; After repeated victories in 1983, 1987, 1990 and 1994 he was finally defeated by a landslide that was the biggest on record, for the left in the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal elections]], and was succeeded as Chancellor by [[Gerhard Schröder]] of the SPD.  Kohl is best known for orchestrating reunification with the approval of all the Four Powers from World War II, who still had a voice in German affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Karl |last=Pruys | title=Kohl: Genius of the Present: A Biography of Helmut Kohl | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reunification==
{{Main|German reunification}}
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of the Berlin Wall, November 1989]]
During the summer of 1989, rapid changes known as ''peaceful revolution'' or ''[[Die Wende]]'' took place in East Germany, which quickly led to [[German reunification]].&lt;ref name=weber /&gt; Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany, many via Hungary after Hungary's reformist government opened its borders. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations in several cities]] continued to grow.

[[File:BRD.png|thumb|300px|Germany in its modern borders]]
Unable to stop the growing civil unrest, [[Erich Honecker]] was forced to resign in October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the [[German reunification]] that came into force on 3 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;For primary sources in English translation and a brief survey see Konrad H. Jarausch, and Volker Gransow, eds. ''Uniting Germany: Documents and Debates, 1944–1993'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schröder===
The SPD in coalition with the Greens won the elections of 1998. SPD leader [[Gerhard Schröder]] positioned himself as a [[centrist]] &quot;[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]&quot; candidate in the mold of Britain's [[Tony Blair]] and America's [[Bill Clinton]].  

Schröder, in March 2003, reversed his position and proposed a significant downsizing of the welfare state, known as [[Agenda 2010]]. He had enough support to overcome opposition from the trade unions and the SPD's left wing.  Agenda 2010 had five goals: tax cuts; labor market deregulation, especially relaxing rules protecting workers from dismissal and setting up [[Hartz concept]] job training; modernizing the welfare state by reducing entitlements; decreasing bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses; and providing new low-interest loans to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul |last=Hockenos |title=Joschka Fischer and the making of the Berlin Republic | year=2008 | pages=313–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merkel===
[[File:MerkelEU50 2.jpg|thumb|German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] (with [[José Barroso]] in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in 2007) was pivotal{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} in drafting and promoting the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] to reform the EU.]]
From 2005 to 2009, Germany was ruled by a [[grand coalition]] led by the CDU's [[Angela Merkel]] as chancellor. Since the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 elections]], Merkel has headed a centre-right government of the CDU/CSU and FDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=Silvia |editor-last=Bolgherini | editor2-first=Florian editor2-last=Grotz | title=Germany After the Grand Coalition: Governance and Politics in a Turbulent Environment | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with France and other EU states, Germany has played the leading role in the [[European Union]]. Germany (especially under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]) was one of the main supporters of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schröder expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the [[UN Security Council]], identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid.  Germany formally adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark rate on 21 December 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Since 1990, the German [[Bundeswehr]] has participated in a number of peacekeeping and disaster relief operations abroad. Since 2002, German troops formed part of the  [[International Security Assistance Force]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], resulting in the first German [[German Armed Forces casualties in Afghanistan|casualties]] in combat missions since World War II.

In [[Late-2000s recession|the worldwide economic recession]] that began in 2008, Germany did relatively well. However, the economic instability of Greece and several other EU nations in 2010–11 forced Germany to reluctantly sponsor a massive financial rescue.

In the wake of the disaster to the nuclear industry in Japan following its 2011 earthquake and tsunami, German public opinion turned sharply against [[nuclear power in Germany]], which produces a fourth of the electricity supply. In response Merkel has announced plans to close down the nuclear system over the next decade, and to rely even more heavily on wind and other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Steven |last=Mufson |title=Germany to close all of its nuclear plants by 2022 | publisher =Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/germany-to-close-all-of-its-nuclear-plants-by-2022/2011/05/30/AG0op1EH_story.html | date= 30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information, see [[Germany in 2011]].

==Sonderweg debate==
{{Main|Sonderweg}}
A major historiographical debate about the German history concerns the ''Sonderweg'', the alleged “special path” that separated German history from the normal course of historical development, and whether or not Nazi Germany was the inevitable result of the ''Sonderweg''. Proponents of the ''Sonderweg'' theory such as [[Fritz Fischer]] point to such events of the [[Revolution of 1848]], the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as [[Gerhard Ritter]] of the ''Sonderweg'' theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the ''Sonderweg'' concept as for the reasons for the ''Sonderweg'', and whether or not the ''Sonderweg'' ended in 1945.
