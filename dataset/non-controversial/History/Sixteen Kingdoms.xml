{{History of China}}
The '''Sixteen Kingdoms''', or less commonly the '''Sixteen States''', were a collection of numerous short-lived sovereign states in [[China proper]] and its neighboring areas from 304 to 439 AD after the retreat of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)]] to [[Northern and southern China|South China]] and before the establishment of the [[Northern Dynasties]]. Originally, the term was first introduced by [[Cui Hong]] in the lost historical record, ''[[Shiliuguo Chunqiu]]'' (the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] of the Sixteen Kingdoms) and restricted to sixteen kingdoms of this era, namely the states of [[Han Zhao]], [[Later Zhao]], [[Cheng Han]], [[Former Liang]], [[Later Liang]], [[Northern Liang]], [[Western Liáng]], [[Southern Liang]], [[Former Yan]], [[Later Yan]], [[Northern Yan]], [[Southern Yan]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Qin]] and [[Western Qin]] and [[Tiefu|Xia]]. The term has been broadened to include all sovereignties from 304 to 439. These do not all exist through the entire period.

A less used term, the '''Period of Sixteen Kingdoms''' represents this turbulent era from 304 to 439.

Almost all rulers of the kingdoms were part of the [[Wu Hu]] ethnicity and claimed to be the [[emperor]]s and [[Chinese nobility#wang|wang]]s (kings). The [[Han Chinese]] founded the four states: [[Northern Yan]], [[Western Liang]], [[Former Liang]] and the [[Ran Min|state of Wei]]. Six Chinese rulers of the [[Former Liang]] remained titularly under the government of the Jin Dynasty. The [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] is not counted as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms even though it was founded during the Period.

Rulers of each of the Kingdoms are listed in relevant articles.

==History==

The Sixteen Kingdoms Period, also known as the [[Wu Hu period]], was one of the most devastating periods in Chinese history. Following a long period of Chinese dominance since the Qin Dynasty, the Wu Hu uprising took over much of the Chinese heartland. It did not end until Jin reclaimed much of central China while Northern Wei took over the areas north of the Yellow River.

===Initial uprising===
{{Main|Wu Hu uprising}}
In 304 AD, following the outbreak of civil war in the ruling [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] in China, the Wu Hu tribes, led by the Xiongnu, rose up against Chinese rule. By 311 AD, with the [[Disaster of Yongjia]], the Wu Hu tribes under the Xiongnu regime of Han then dominated the North China plain.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 383&lt;/ref&gt; By 317 AD, Jin forces had been completely driven out of North China. An attempt to recover the Central China plain under general Zu Tì (祖逖） was initially successful in recovering all of Henan and Shandong but ended with Zu's death in 321 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han-Zhao and Later Zhao===
{{Main|Han Zhao|Later Zhao}}
Although the Xiongnu regime of Han (which was changed to Former Zhao) was dominant in North China, the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] general [[Shi Le]] challenged the Xiongnu's dominance. In 329 AD, Shi le overthrew Former Zhao and reunified North China.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 394-395&lt;/ref&gt; Jie rule was extremely brutal, reportedly even using many Chinese girls as provisions for the army. Later Zhao's rule finally ended with the ascension of [[Ran Min]] in 350 AD.

===Rise of Ran Wei===
{{Main|Wei-Jie war|Wei-Xianbei war}}
Ran Min, a Chinese, restored native rule to China in 350 AD. However, his rule was opposed by the Jie and other Wu Hu. In response, Ran Min ordered that thousands of Wu Hu be killed.  Attempts to overthrow Ran Wei by the Jie and other Wu Hu tribes were largely defeated until the Xianbei invaded Ran Wei in 352 AD and defeated Ran Min.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 403-404&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former Yan and Former Qin===

The regime of Former Yan founded by the Xianbei then proceeded to dominate much of North China. Meanwhile, Di tribesmen conquered the region around Shanxi and formed the regime of Former Qin. In 370 AD, Former Qin invaded and conquered Former Yan, unifying most of North China. By 376 AD, after two campaigns against Former Liang and the state of Dai, Former Qin ruler Fu Jian reunified all of North China. The independence of the last Chinese state, the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]], was now in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 412-413&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huan Wen's expeditions===

{{Main|Huan Wen's expeditions}}
The Jin general Huan Wen was determined to reclaim North China for the Chinese Jin Dynasty. Between 346 AD and 369 AD, Huan Wen launched a series of expeditions against the Wu Hu states in the North. Nevertheless, because of lack of support from the Jin court, Huan Wen did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of Former Qin===
{{Main|Battle of Fei River}}
Attempting to capitalize on his success and conquer all of China, Fu Jian then proceeded to invade the territory of the Jin Dynasty, the last Han Chinese state whose conquest would have make Fu Jian the first non-Chinese ruler of China. However, the Jin army rallied and the Chinese forces scored a massive success on the Fei river, where some 300,000 Former Qin troops were routed by an army of 80,000 Jin soldiers. Former Qin then collapsed. After the battle, Jin forces reclaimed much of Henan and Shantung.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 419&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liu Yu's expeditions===
{{Main|Liu Yu's expeditions}}
In 406 AD, the Jin general Liu Yu began a series of campaigns aimed at reclaiming the Chinese heartland. These campaigns were extraordinarily successful and by 416 AD Jin forces had reclaimed the two capitals of Luoyang and Chang'an which they had lost a century earlier. However, Chang'an was lost in 417 AD. Nevertheless, Liu Yu's success meant that all Chinese territory up to the Yellow river was now reclaimed, though the North was now under the control of Xianbei [[Northern Wei]].&lt;ref&gt;Li and Zheng, pg 428-432&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Han and Non-Wuhu Involvement==
The Korean-[[Mohe people|Mohe]] [[Goguryeo]] kingdom was a powerful and influential state in northeast China at the beginning of the Sixteen Kingdoms period.  Goguryeo was attacked by the Murong [[Xianbei]] numerous times, and in [[342|AD 342]] Prince [[Murong Huang]] of [[Former Yan]] captured the Goguryeo capital [[Hwando]].  Under the powerful and dynamic leadership of feudal kings, Goguryeo during the reign of [[Gwanggaeto the Great]] successfully invaded the Korean kingdoms of [[Baekje]], [[Silla]], and [[Dongbuyeo]].  Riding its success, Goguryeo campaigned against the [[Later Yan]] kingdom, obtaining the [[Liao River]] region.  Later Yan king [[Murong Xi]] twice launched retaliatory attacks to reclaim the Liao River watershed territory, but was only partially successful.  At Northern Yan's destruction by the [[Northern Wei]], Yan king [[Feng Hong]] fled to Goguryeo to seek asylum.  Although granted asylum, Hong was said to have acted as if he was still king, issuing orders and demanding respect, and was executed by King [[Jangsu of Goguryeo]].  The [[Yuwen]] Xianbei group [[Kumo Xi]], who lived north of [[Youzhou]], and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] began increasing in strength.  In 414, the Kumo Xi tribes sent a trade caravan to [[Northern Yan]], then joined with the Khitan in declaring allegiance to Northern Yan, and then to Northern Wei after its destruction of Northern Yan.  Thus, the Northern Wei (essentially the [[Tuoba]] Xianbei), held ''de facto'' rule over the entire [[Mongolian Plateau]] and the Liao River region.

To the west of Chinese territory at the time (in modern [[Xinjiang]]) lay the kingdoms of [[Shanshan]], [[Kucha]], [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]], Dongshi, and [[Shule County|Shule]].  These kingdoms were often controlled or influenced by the various Liang kingdoms that existed during the Sixteen Kingdoms period.  The [[Former Liang]] organized Gaochang Commandery ({{zh|c=高昌郡}}) and Tiandi County ({{zh|c=闐地縣}}) in the west, both under the administration of the Gaochang Governor.  Day-to-day administration was run out of several forts: Western Regions Chief Clerk, Wu and Ji Colonel, and Jade Gate Commissioner of the Army.  Other Liangzhou states generally followed this administrative system.  In 382, the Former Qin king [[Fú Jiān|Fu Jian]] sent General [[Lü Guang]] on a military expedition to the [[Dayuan]] kingdom and promoted him to Protector General of the western border regions.  After Qin collapsed and Lü Guang founded the Northern Liang, the western border forts and the Piqan kingdom all became parts of or vassals to the Northern Liang.
