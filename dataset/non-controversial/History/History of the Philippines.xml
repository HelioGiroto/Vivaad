The '''history of the Philippines''' is believed to have begun with the arrival of the first humans using rafts or primitive boats, at least 67,000 years ago as the 2007 discovery of [[Callao Man]] showed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/callao-man-philippines.html 'Callao Man' Could Redraw Filipino History : Discovery News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded visit from the [[Western world|West]] is the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who sighted the island of [[Samar Island]] on March 16, 1521 and landed on [[Homonhon]] Island (now part of  [[Guiuan, Eastern Samar]] province) the next day. Homonhon Island is southeast of Samar island. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last= Bergreen |first=Laurence |authorlink= Laurence Bergreen |title=Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe  |publisher=William Morrow |year= 2003 |month= 14 October|isbn= 978-0-06-621173-2, ISBN 0-06-093638-X |ref= harv |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Before Magellan arrived, [[Negrito]] tribes inhabited the isles, who were subsequently joined and largely supplanted by migrating groups of [[Austronesians]]. This population had stratified into hunter-gatherer tribes, warrior societies, petty [[plutocracy|plutocracies]] and maritime-oriented harbor principalities which eventually grew into kingdoms, [[raja]]hnates, principalities, confederations and sultanates. States included the [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized]] Rajahnate of [[Kingdom of Butuan|Butuan]] and [[Cebu]], the dynasty of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]], the august kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Namayan|Maysapan]] and [[Kingdom of Maynila|Maynila]], the [[Confederation of Madyaas]], the [[sinified]] [[Country of Mai]], as well as the Muslim Sultanates of [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]] and [[Maguindanao]]. These small maritime states flourished from as early as the 1st Millenium.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} These kingdoms traded with what are now now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the settlements were independent [[Barangay]]s allied with one of the larger states.  The “balangay” or “barangay” represented an independent community in the Archipelago ruled by a “Datu”. There were, however, instances where a Datu of a certain barangay was aided by a council of elders in running the affairs of the baranggay similar to privy councils of European monarchs. In that patriarchal society, the Datu and his family constituted the highest authority in the barangay and were therefore considered the equivalent of European monarchs. His rule was absolute. He dispensed justice and declared war against other barangays. Therefore, at the apex of pre-Spanish nobility in the Philippine Archipelago, was the Datu – the term commonly use by the Tagalogs. In Mindanao, ‘Sultan’ and ‘Rajah’ were used accordingly for the highest chief of their respective communities. 

[[Spanish colonization]] and settlement began with the arrival of [[Miguel López de Legazpi]]'s expedition on February 13, 1565 who established the first permanent settlement of San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Cebu.html

Spanish rule achieved the political unification of almost the whole archipelago, that previously had been composed by independent kingdoms and communities, pushing back south the advancing [[Islam]]ic forces and creating the first draft of the nation that was to be known as the [[Philippines]]. Spain also introduced [[Christianity]], the [[code of law]], the oldest Universities and the first public education system in Asia, the western European version of [[printing]], the [[Gregorian calendar]] and invested heavily on all kinds of modern infrastructures, such as train networks and modern bridges.

The [[Spanish East Indies]] were ruled as part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and administered from [[Mexico City]] from 1565 to 1821, and administered directly from [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] from 1821 until the end of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, except for a brief [[British occupation of the Philippines|period of British rule]] from 1762 to 1764. During the Spanish period, numerous towns were founded, infrastructures built, new crops and livestock introduced. The Chinese, British, Portuguese, Dutch, Japanese, and indigenous traders, complained that the Spanish reduced trade by attempting to enforce a Spanish [[monopoly]]. Spanish missionaries attempted to convert the population to [[Christianity]] and were eventually generally successful in the northern and central lowlands. They founded schools, a university, and some hospitals, principally in Manila and the largest Spanish fort settlements. Universal education was made free for all Filipino subjects in 1863 and remained so until the end of the Spanish colonial era. This measure was at the vanguard of contemporary Asian countries, and led to an important class of educated natives, like Jose Rizal. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century, that Spanish literature and press flourished.

The [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain began in August 1896, but it was largely unsuccessful until it received support from the United States, culminating two years later with a proclamation of independence and the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], at the end of the Spanish–American War, transferred control of the Philippines to the [[United States]]. This agreement was not recognized by the insurgent First Philippine Republic Government which, on June 2, 1899, proclaimed a [[Declaration of War]] against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Philippine president [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was captured in 1901 and the U.S. government declared the conflict officially over in 1902. The Filipino leaders, for the most part, accepted that the Americans had won, but hostilities continued and only began to decline in 1913, leaving a total number of casualties on the Filipino side of more than one million dead, many of them civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manila p.15&quot;&gt;Tipografía del Colegio de Santo Tomás de Manila, titulado Geografía General de Las Islas Filipinas, Padre Fray Manuel Arellano Remondo, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Philippines 1998. p.31&quot;&gt;&quot;The Philippines: Land of Broken Promises&quot;, James B.

With a promising [[economy of the Philippines|economy]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the Philippines in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rise of [[student activism]] and civil unrest against President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] who declared [[martial law]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia philippines&quot;/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}} The peaceful and bloodless [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986, however, brought about the ousting of Marcos and a return to [[democracy]] for the country.

There are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient Filipinos. F. Landa Jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos [[Prehistory of the Philippines#Jocano's Local Origins Theory|evolved locally]].

ISBN 978-971-542-508-7.&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the [[antediluvian]] [[Sundaland]] area around 48000 to 5000 BCE rather than by wide-scale migration. The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian Expansion Theory]] states that [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesians]] coming from [[Taiwan]] began migrating to the Philippines around 4000 BCE, displacing earlier arrivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;solheim&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080803020434/http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-03 |title=Origins of the Filipinos and Their Languages |last=Solheim |first=Wilhelm G., II. |authorlink=Wilhelm Solheim |date=January 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mijares, Armand Salvador B.

The Negritos were early settlers but their appearance in the Philippines has not been reliably dated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Not one roof beam, not one grain of rice, not one pygmy Negrito bone has been recovered. Any theory which describes such details is therefore pure hypothesis and should be honestly presented as such.&quot;, {{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were followed by speakers of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], a branch of the [[Austronesian languages]], who began to arrive in successive waves beginning about 4000 BC, displacing the earlier arrivals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-03|title=The Filipinos and their Languages|last=Solheim II|first=Wilhelm G|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1000 BC the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had developed into four distinct kinds of peoples: tribal groups, such as the [[Aetas]], [[Hanunoo people|Hanunoo]], [[Ilongot people|Ilongots]] and the [[Mangyan]] who depended on [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gathering]] and were concentrated in forests; warrior societies, such as the [[Isneg]] and [[Kalingas]] who practiced social ranking and [[ritualized]] [[warfare]] and roamed the plains; the petty [[plutocracy]] of the [[Ifugao]] Cordillera Highlanders, who occupied the mountain ranges of [[Luzon]]; and the harbor principalities of the estuarine civilizations that grew along rivers and seashores while participating in trans-island maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Around 300–700 CE the seafaring peoples of the islands traveling in ''[[balangay]]s'' began to trade with the [[Indianized kingdoms]] in the [[Malay Archipelago]] and the nearby [[East Asian]] principalities, adopting influences from both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Philippines and India'' – Dhirendra Nath Roy, Manila 1929 and ''India and The World'' – By Buddha Prakash p. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cembrano|first=Margarita R|title=Patterns of the Past: The Ethno Archaeology of Butuan.|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8446/tara.html|accessdate=August 18, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091022182212/http://geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8446/tara.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=November 2010}}

From the various [[Sanskrit]] terms and titles seen in the document, the culture and society of Manila Bay was that of a [[Hindu]]-[[Old Malay]] amalgamation, similar to the cultures of [[Java]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Sumatra]] at the time. There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the [[Doctrina Christiana]] of the late 16th century, written at the start of the Spanish period in both native [[Baybayin]] script and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Other artifacts with Kawi script and baybayin were found, such as an Ivory seal from [[Butuan]] dated to the early 11th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/mystery/seal.htm The Butuan Ivory Seal], [http://www.bibingka.com/ bibingka.com]{{verify credibility|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Calatagan]] pot with baybayin inscription, dated to the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/mystery/pot.htm The Calatagan Pot], [http://www.bibingka.com/ bibingka.com]{{verify credibility|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the year 900, the thalassocracy centered in [[Manila Bay]] flourished via an active trade with Chinese, Japanese, Malays, and various other peoples in East Asia. Tondo thrived as the capital and the seat of power of this ancient kingdom, which was led by kings under the title &quot;Lakan&quot; and ruled a large part of what is now known as Luzon from or possibly before 900 AD to 1571.

===The Rajahnate of Cebu===
{{Main|Rajahnate of Cebu}}

The Rajahnate of Cebu was a classical Philippine state which used to exist on Cebu island prior to the arrival of the Spanish. It was founded by [[Sri]] Lumay otherwise known as Rajamuda Lumaya, a minor prince of the [[Chola dynasty]] which happened to occupy Sumatra. He was sent by the [[maharajah]] to establish a base for expeditionary forces to subdue the local kingdoms but he rebelled and established his own independent Rajahnate instead. This rajahnate warred against the 'magalos' (Slave traders) of [[Maguindanao]] and had an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Butuan|Butuan Rajahnate]] before it was weakened by the insurrection of [[Datu]] (Lord) [[Lapulapu]].&lt;ref&gt;Jovito Abellana, Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Abellana, &quot;Bisaya Patronymesis Sri Visjaya&quot; (Ms., Cebuano Studies Center, ca. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Datu]] Puti led a mass migration to the central islands of the Philippines, fleeing from Rajah Makatunao of the island of [[Borneo]]. Upon reaching the island of [[Panay]] and purchasing the island from Negrito chieftain Marikudo, they established a confederation of polities and named it the [[Confederation of Madyaas]] centered in [[Aklan]] and they settled the surrounding islands of the [[Visayas]]. This confederation reached its peak under Datu Padojinog. During his reign the confederations' hegemony extended over most of the islands of Visayas.  Its people consistently made piratical attacks against Chinese [[Imperialism|imperial]] shipping.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Epic of the Maragats&quot;&gt;''Maragtas'' by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Spanish expeditions and conquests===
{{main|Spanish-Moro Conflict}}
[[Image:Ferdinand Magellan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived in the Philippines in 1521.]]

Parts of the Philippine Islands were known to Europeans before the 1521 Spanish expedition around the world led by [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-born Spanish explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who were not the [[first Europeans in the Philippines]].{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} Magellan landed on the island called [[Homonhon]], claiming the islands he saw for Spain, and naming them Islas de San Lázaro.&lt;ref name=&quot;lac47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established friendly relations with some of the local leaders especially with [[Rajah Humabon]] and converted some of them to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lac47&quot;/&gt; In the Philippines, they explored many islands including the island of Mactan. However, Magellan was killed during the [[Battle of Mactan]] against the datu [[Lapu-Lapu]].

Over the next several decades, other Spanish expeditions were dispatched to the islands. In 1543, [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] led an expedition to the islands and gave the name Las Islas Filipinas (after [[Philip II of Spain]]) to the islands of [[Samar Island|Samar]] and [[Leyte Island|Leyte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lac52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was extended to the entire archipelago in the twentieth century.

[[File:Spanish Conquest of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|left|A late 17th-century manuscript by Gaspar de San Agustin from the [[Archive of the Indies]], depicting López de Legazpi's conquest of the Philippines]]
European colonization began in earnest when Spanish explorer [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] arrived from [[Mexico]] in 1565 and formed the first European settlements in [[Cebu]]. Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian monks, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the Archipelago. In 1571, the Spanish occupied the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Maynila|Maynila]] and [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]] and established [[Manila]] as the capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurlansky|1999|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joaquin, Nick 1988&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Joaquin|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legazpi built a fort in Maynila and made overtures of friendship to [[Lakan Dula|Rajah Lakandula]] of Tondo, who accepted. However, Maynila's former ruler, [[Rajah Sulaiman]], refused to submit to Legazpi, but failed to get the support of Lakandula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north. When Sulaiman and a force of Tagalog warriors attacked the Spaniards in the battle of Bangcusay, he was finally defeated and killed.

In 1587, [[Magat Salamat]], one of the children of Lakan Dula, Lakan Dula's nephew, and the lords of the neighboring areas of Tondo, Pandacan, Marikina, Candaba, Navotas and Bulacan were executed when the [[Conspiracy of the Maharlikas|Tondo Conspiracy of 1587-1588]] failed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Spanish power was further consolidated after Miguel López de Legazpi's conquest of the [[Confederation of Madya-as]], his subjugation of [[Rajah Tupas]], the King of Cebu and [[Juan de Salcedo|Juan de Salcedo's]] conquest of the provinces of Zambales, La Union, Ilocos, the coast of Cagayan, and the ransacking of the Chinese warlord [[Limahong|Limahong's]] pirate kingdom in [[Pangasinan]].

The Spanish and the Moros also waged many wars over hundreds of years in the [[Spanish-Moro Conflict]], not until the 19th century did Spain succeed in defeating the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and taking [[Mindanao]] under nominal suzerainty.

===Spanish settlement during the 16th and 17th centuries===
{{Merge from|End of Dutch threat in the Philippines|date=May 2011}}
The &quot;Memoria de las Encomiendas en las Islas&quot; of 1591, just twenty years after the conquest of Luzon, reveals a remarkable{{Says who|date=July 2011}} progress in the work of colonization and the spread of Christianity. In the city of Manila was built a cathedral with an episcopal palace, Augustinian, Dominican and Franciscan monasteries and a Jesuit house. The king maintained a hospital for the Spanish settlers and there was another hospital for the natives run by the Franciscans. The garrison was composed of roughly two hundred soldiers. In the suburb of Tondo there was a convent run by Franciscan friars and other by the Dominicans that offered Christian education to the Chinese converted to Christianity. The same report reveals that in and around Manila were collected nine thousand four hundred and ten tributes, indicating a population of about thirty thousand and six hundred forty souls who were under the instruction of thirteen missionaries (ministers of doctrine), apart from the monks in monasteries. In the former province of Pampanga the population estimate was 74,700 and twenty-eight missionaries. In Pangasinan 2,400 people with eight missionaries. In Cagayan and islands Babuyanes 96,000 souls but not missionaries. In La Laguna 48,400 souls with twenty-seven missionaries. In Bicol and Camarines Catanduanes islands 86,640 souls with fifteen missionaries. The total was 667,612 souls under the care of one hundred forty missionaries, of which seventy-nine were Augustinians, nine Dominicans and forty-two Franciscans.&lt;ref&gt;Retana, &quot;Relacion de las Encomiendas existentes en Filipinas el dia 31 de 1.591&quot; Archivo del Bibliófilo Filipino IV, p 39-112&lt;/ref&gt;

The fragmented nature of the islands made it easy for Spanish colonization. The Spanish then brought political unification to most of the Philippine archipelago via the conquest of the various states although they were unable to fully incorporate parts of the [[sultanates]] of [[Mindanao]] and the areas where tribes and highland plutocracy of the [[Ifugao]] of Northern [[Luzon]] were established. The Spanish introduced elements of [[western civilization]] such as the [[code of law]], western [[printing]] and the [[Gregorian calendar]] alongside new food resources such as [[maize]], [[pineapple]] and [[chocolate]] from [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Spain|title = Recopilación de las Leyes de Indias.

[[File:Santo tomas libreria.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Library of the [[University of Santo Tomás]] in Manila, 1887]]
[[Philippines education during Spanish rule|Education]] played a major role in the socioeconomic transformation of the archipelago. The oldest [[universities]], [[colleges]], and [[vocational schools]] and the first modern [[state school|public education]] system in [[Asia]] were all created during the Spanish colonial period, and by the time Spain was replaced by the [[United States]] as the colonial power, [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] were among the most educated subjects in all of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coleman|2009|pp=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7oiTkrg9tfUC&amp;pg=PA17 17–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits founded the Colegio de Manila in 1590, which later became the [[Universidad de San Ignacio]], a royal and pontifical university. They also founded the [[Colegio de San Ildefonso]] on August 1, 1595. After the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#Philippines|expulsion of the Society of Jesus]] in 1768, the management of the Jesuit schools passed to other parties. On April 28, 1611, through the initiative of Bishop Miguel de Benavides, the [[University of Santo Tomás|Universidad de Santo Tomás]] was founded in Manila. The Jesuits also founded the Colegio de San José (1601) and took over the Escuela Municipal, later to be called the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] (1859). All institutions offered courses included not only religious topics but also science subjects such as physics, chemistry, natural history and mathematics. The University of Santo Tomás, for example, started by teaching theology, philosophy and humanities and during the 18th century, the Faculty of Jurisprudence and Canonical Law, together with the schools of medicine and pharmacy were opened.

Outside the tertiary institutions, the efforts of missionaries were in no way limited to religious instruction but also geared towards promoting social and economic advancement of the islands. They cultivated into the natives their innate{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} taste for music and taught Spanish language to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Antonio de Morga|title = [[Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas]] | year = 1609 | publisher = Fondo de Cultura| isbn = 0-521-01035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also introduced advances in rice agriculture, brought from America corn and cocoa and developed the farming of indigo, coffee and sugar cane. The only commercial plant introduced by a government agency was the plant of tobacco.

Church and state were inseparably linked in Spanish policy, with the state assuming responsibility for religious establishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Spain's objectives in colonizing the Philippines was the conversion of the local population to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The work of conversion was facilitated by the absence of other organized religions, except for Islam, which was still predominant in the southwest. The pageantry of the church had a wide appeal, reinforced by the incorporation of indigenous social customs into religious observances.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;/&gt; The eventual outcome was a new [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority, from which the Muslims of western Mindanao and the upland tribal peoples of Luzon remained detached and alienated (such as the Ifugaos of the Cordillera region and the Mangyans of Mindoro).&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;/&gt;

At the lower levels of administration, the Spanish built on traditional village organization by co-opting local leaders. This system of indirect rule helped create an indigenous [[upper class]], called the [[principalia]], who had local wealth, high status, and other privileges. This perpetuated an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] system of local control. Among the most significant changes under Spanish rule was that the indigenous idea of communal use and ownership of land was replaced with the concept of private ownership and the conferring of titles on members of the principalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;/&gt;

Around 1608 [[William Adams]], an English navigator contacted the interim governor of the Philippines, [[Rodrigo de Vivero y Velasco]] on behalf of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who wished to establish direct trade contacts with [[New Spain]]. Friendly letters were exchanged, officially starting relations between Japan and New Spain. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] from [[Mexico]], via the ''Royal [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]'' of Manila, and administered directly from Spain from 1821 after the [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shafer|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1898.

The [[Manila Galleon]]s which linked Manila to [[Acapulco]] traveled once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Spanish military fought off various indigenous revolts and several external colonial challenges, especially from the British, Chinese pirates, Dutch, and Portuguese. [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to [[Christianity]] and founded schools, universities, and hospitals. In 1863 a Spanish decree introduced education, establishing public schooling in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm |title=US Country Studies: Education in the Philippines |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1646, a series of five naval actions known as the [[Battles of La Naval de Manila]] was fought between the forces of Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]], as part of the [[Eighty Years War]]. Although the Spanish forces consisted of just two Manila galleons and a [[galley]] with crews composed mainly of Filipino volunteers, against three separate Dutch squadrons, totaling eighteen ships, the Dutch squadrons were severely defeated in all fronts by the Spanish-Filipino forces, forcing the Dutch to abandon their plans for an invasion of the Philippines.

===Spanish rule during the 18th century===
Colonial income derived mainly from [[entrepôt]] trade: The [[Manila Galleon]]s sailing from the Fort of Manila to the Fort of [[Acapulco]] on the west coast of Mexico brought shipments of [[silver bullion]], and minted coin that were exchanged for return cargoes of Asian, and Pacific products. A total of 110 Manila galleons set sail in the 250 years of the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade (1565 to 1815). There was no direct trade with Spain until 1766.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;/&gt;

The Philippines was never profitable as a colony during Spanish rule, and the long war against the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] in the 17th century together with the intermittent conflict with the Muslims in the South nearly bankrupted the colonial treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-4&quot;/&gt; The Royal Fiscal of Manila wrote a letter to [[King Charles III of Spain]], in which he advises to abandon the colony.

The Philippines survived on an annual subsidy paid by the Spanish Crown, and the 200-year-old fortifications at Manila had not been improved much since first built by the early Spanish colonizers.&lt;ref name=tracy1995p12p55&gt;{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|pp=12,55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the circumstances that made possible the brief British occupation of Manila between 1762 and 1764.

====British invasion (1762–1764)====
{{Main|British occupation of Manila}}
[[Image:AndaPostern90503.jpg|thumb|right|Sign in Fort Santiago Manila, next to the departure point of Simón de Anda.]]
Britain declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762 and on 24 September 1762 a force of British Army regulars and [[British East India Company]] soldiers, supported by the ships and men of the East Indies Squadron of the British [[Royal Navy]], sailed into [[Manila Bay]] from Madras, India.&lt;ref name=tracy1995p9&gt;{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manila fell to the British on October 4 1762.

The British forces were confined to Manila and the nearby port of Cavite by the resistance organised by the provisional Spanish coloinial government. Suffering a breakdown of command and troop desertions as a result of their failure to secure control of the Philippines, the British ended their occupation of Manila by sailing away in April 1764 as agreed to in the peace negotiations in Europe. The Spaniards then persecuted the Binondo Chinese community for its role in aiding the British.

====Spanish rule in the second part of the 18th Century====
[[Image:Flag of New Spain.svg|thumb|right|The Cross of Burgundy served as the flag of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]]]
In 1766 was established direct communication with Spain and trade with Europe through a national ship based on Spain. Those expeditions were administered since 1785 by the Real Compañía Filipina, which was granted a monopoly of trade between Spain and the islands that lasted until 1834, when the company was terminated by the Spanish crown due to poor management and financial losses.

In 1781, Governor-General [[José Basco y Vargas]] established the [[Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País|Economic Society of the Friends of the Country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-5b&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines was administered from the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] until the grant of independence to Mexico in 1821 necessitated the direct rule from Spain of the Philippines from that year.

===Spanish rule during the 19th Century===
During the 19th century Spain invested heavily in education and infrastructure. Through the Education Decree of December 20, 1863, [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] decreed the establishment of a free public school system that used Spanish as the language of instruction, leading to increasing numbers of educated Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fundación Santa María (Madrid)|1994| p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=QDegTDTzMlAC&amp;pg=PA508 508]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 cut travel time to Spain, which facilitated the rise of the [[ilustrado]]s, an enlightened class of Filipinos that had been able to expand their studies in Spain and Europe.

[[File:Puente claveria.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Puente de Claveria ([[Quezon Bridge]])]]
A great deal of infrastructure projects were undertaken during the 19th century that put the Philippine economy and standard of living ahead of most of its Asian neighbors and even many European countries at that time. Among them were a [[Philippine National Railways|railway system]] for Luzon, a tramcar network for Manila, and the '''Puente Colgante''' (now known as the [[Quezon Bridge]]), Asia's first steel suspension bridge.&lt;ref name=Borja&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xXpiujH2uOwC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=Ynchausti+y+Compania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vbmw2sPfXn&amp;sig=reCvPPoqHkL_-fGbANUHn6EE6mg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LaU4Ta7xGoWclgfs142NBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ynchausti%20y%20Compania&amp;f=false Marciano R. de Borja, ''Basques in the Philippines''], University of Nevada Press, 2005, p. 132, accessed 12 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 1, 1851 the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|Banco Español-Filipino de Isabel II]] was established to attend the needs of the rapid economic boom, that had greatly increased its pace since 1840 as a result of a new economy based on a rational exploitation of the agricultural resources of the islands. The increase in textile fiber crops such as [[abacá]], oil products derived from the coconut, indigo, that was growing in demand, etc., generated an increase in money supply that led to the creation of the bank. Banco Español-Filipino was also granted the power to print a Philippine-specific currency (the [[Philippine peso]]) for the first time (before 1851, many currencies were used, mostly the [[pieces of eight]]).

Spanish Manila was seen in the 19th century as a model of colonial governance that effectively put the interests of the original inhabitants of the islands before those of the colonial power. As [[John Crawfurd]] put it in its History of the Indian Archipelago, in all of Asia the &quot;Philippines alone did improve in civilization, wealth, and populousness under the colonial rule&quot; of a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;John Crawfurd, ''History of the Indian Archipelago'', (1820), page 445&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bowring]], Governor General of British Hong Kong from 1856 to 1860), wrote after his trip to Manila:
{{quote|
Credit is certainly due to Spain for having bettered the condition of a people who, though comparatively highly civilized, yet being continually distracted by petty wars, had sunk into a disordered and uncultivated state.

The inhabitants of these beautiful Islands upon the whole, may well be considered to have lived as comfortably during the last hundred years, protected form all external enemies and governed by mild laws vis-a-vis those from any other tropical country under native or European sway, owing in some measure, to the frequently discussed peculiar (Spanish) circumstances which protect the interests of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowring, &quot;Travels in the Philippines&quot;, p. 18, London, 1875&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In The inhabitants of the Philippines, Frederick Henry Sawyer wrote:
{{quote|
Until an inept bureaucracy was substituted for the old paternal rule, and the revenue quadrupled by increased taxation, the Filipinos were as happy a community as could be found in any colony. The population greatly multiplied; they lived in competence, if not in affluence; cultivation was extended, and the exports steadily increased. Let us be just; what British, French, or Dutch colony, populated by natives can compare with the Philippines as they were until 1895?.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic H. Sawyer, &quot;The inhabitants of the Philippines&quot;, pp. 139-139, London, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first official census in the Philippines was carried out in 1878.

The estimated [[GDP per capita]] for the Philippines in 1900, the year Spain left, was of $1,033.00. That made it the second richest place in all of Asia, just a little behind Japan ($1,135.00), and far ahead of China ($652.00) or India ($625.00).

===Philippine Revolution===
{{Main|Philippine Revolution}}
Revolutionary sentiments arose in 1872 after three Filipino priests, [[Mariano Gómez]], [[José Burgos]], and [[Jacinto Zamora]], known as [[Gomburza]], were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed.  This would inspire a [[propaganda movement]] in Spain, organized by [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]], [[José Rizal]], [[Graciano López-Jaena]], and [[Mariano Ponce]], that clamored for adequate representation to the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortes]] and later for independence. [[José Rizal]], the most celebrated intellectual and radical illustrado of the era, wrote the novels &quot;[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]&quot;, and &quot;[[El filibusterismo]]&quot;, which greatly inspired the movement for independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine History|url=http://pinas.dlsu.edu.ph/history/history.html|publisher=DLSU-Manila|accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Katipunan]], a [[secret society]] whose primary purpose was that of overthrowing Spanish rule in the Philippines, was founded by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] who became its Supremo (leader).

[[Image:Bandera 03.jpg|thumb|left|An early flag of the Filipino revolutionaries]]
The [[Philippine Revolution]] began in 1896. Rizal was wrongly implicated in the outbreak of the revolution and executed for [[treason]] in 1896. The Katipunan in [[Cavite]] split into two groups, [[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]], led by [[Mariano Álvarez]] (a relative of Bonifacio's by marriage), and [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]], led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Leadership conflicts between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo culminated in the execution or assassination of the former by the latter's soldiers. Aguinaldo agreed to a truce with the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] and Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were exiled to Hong Kong. Not all the revolutionary generals complied with the agreement. One, General [[Francisco Makabulos]], established a Central Executive Committee to serve as the [[interim government]] until a more suitable one was created. Armed conflicts resumed, this time coming from almost every  province in Spanish-governed Philippines.

[[Image:Malolos congress.jpg|thumb|right|Revolutionaries gather during the Malolos congress of the First Philippine Republic.]]
In 1898, as conflicts continued in the Philippines, the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS Maine]], having been sent to [[Cuba]] because of U.S. concerns for the safety of its citizens during an ongoing [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban revolution]], exploded and sank in [[Havana]] harbor.  This event precipitated the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] defeated the Spanish squadron at Manila, a [[German Empire|German]] squadron arrived in Manila and engaged in maneuvers which Dewey, seeing this as obstruction of his blockade, offered war—after which the Germans backed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wionzek|2000|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German Emperor expected an American defeat, with Spain left in a sufficiently weak position for the revolutionaries to capture Manila—leaving the Philippines ripe for German picking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wionzek|2000|p=xvi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. invited Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines in the hope he would rally Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government. Aguinaldo arrived on May 19, 1898, via transport provided by Dewey. By the time U.S. land forces had arrived, the Filipinos had taken control of the entire island of Luzon, except for the walled city of [[Intramuros]]. On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the Philippines in [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]], [[Cavite]], establishing the [[First Philippine Republic]] under Asia's first democratic constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinas&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila]], the United States captured the city from the Spanish. This battle marked an end of Filipino-American collaboration, as Filipino forces were prevented from entering the captured city of Manila, an action deeply resented by the Filipinos.&lt;ref name=&quot;lac126&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain and the United States sent commissioners to Paris to draw up the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Spanish–American War. The Filipino representative, [[Felipe Agoncillo]], was excluded from sessions as the revolutionary government was not recognized by the family of nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lac126&quot;/&gt; Although there was substantial domestic opposition, the United States decided to annex the Philippines. In addition to [[Guam]] and [[Puerto Rico]], Spain was forced in the negotiations to hand over the Philippines to the U.S. in exchange for [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000,000.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines - The Malolos Constitution and the Treaty of Paris|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/14.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President McKinley justified the annexation of the Philippines by saying that it was &quot;a gift from the gods&quot; and that since &quot;they were unfit for self-government, ... there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first Philippine Republic resisted the U.S. occupation, resulting in the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1913).

==American rule (1898–1946)==
{{Main|History of the Philippines (1898-1946)}}
[[Image:McKinleyPhilippinesCartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1898 political cartoon showing [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[William McKinley|McKinley]] with a native child. Here, returning the Philippines to Spain is compared to throwing the child off a cliff.]]
Filipinos initially saw their relationship with the United States as that of two nations joined in a common struggle against Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States later distanced itself from the interests of the Filipino insurgents. Emilio Aguinaldo was unhappy that the United States would not commit to paper a statement of support for [[Philippine independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations deteriorated and tensions heightened as it became clear that the Americans were in the islands to stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-13&quot;/&gt;

===Philippine–American War===
{{Main|Philippine–American War}}
Hostilities broke out on February 4, 1899, after two American privates on patrol killed three Filipino soldiers in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], a [[Manila]] suburb.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident sparked the [[Philippine–American War]], which would cost far more money and took far more lives than the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pinas&quot;/&gt; Some 126,000 American soldiers would be committed to the conflict; 4,234 Americans died, as did 16,000 Filipino soldiers who were part of a nationwide [[guerrilla]] movement of indeterminate numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-15&quot;/&gt;

The general population, caught between Americans and rebels, suffered significantly. At least one million Filipinos lost their lives as a direct result of the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;Manila p.15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Philippines 1998. p.31&quot;/&gt; including as many as 200,000 who died as a result of the [[cholera]] epidemic at the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Gates, &quot;[http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html War-Related Deaths in the Philippines]&quot;, ''Pacific Historical Review'' ,  v. 53, No. 3 (August, 1984), 367-378.&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocities were committed by both sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-15&quot;/&gt;

The poorly equipped Filipino troops were easily overpowered by American troops in open combat, but they were formidable opponents in guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-15&quot;/&gt; [[Malolos City|Malolos]], the revolutionary capital, was captured on March 31, 1899. Aguinaldo and his government escaped, however, establishing a new capital at [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija]]. On June 5, 1899, [[Antonio Luna]], Aguinaldo's most capable military commander, was killed by Aguinaldo's guards in an apparent assassination while visiting [[Cabanatuan]], [[Nueva Ecija]] to meet with Aguinaldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=222}}; {{Harvnb|Zaide|1994|p=270}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With his best commander dead and his troops suffering continued defeats as American forces pushed into northern [[Luzon]], Aguinaldo dissolved the regular army on November 13 and ordered the establishment of decentralized guerrilla commands in each of several military zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linn|2000|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key general, [[Gregorio del Pilar]], was killed on December 2, 1899 in the [[Battle of Tirad Pass]]&amp;mdash;a [[rear guard]] action to delay the Americans while Aguinaldo made good his escape through the mountains.

Aguinaldo was captured at [[Palanan, Isabela]] on March 23, 1901 and was brought to Manila. Convinced of the futility of further resistance, he swore allegiance to the United States and issued a proclamation calling on his compatriots to lay down their arms, officially bringing an end to the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-15&quot;/&gt; However, sporadic insurgent resistance continued in various parts of the Philippines, especially in the Muslim south, until 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=247–260, 294–297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, President McKinley sent the [[Taft Commission]], to the Philippines, with a mandate to legislate laws and re-engineer the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Escalante|2007|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 1, 1901, [[William Howard Taft]], the head of the commission, was inaugurated as Civil Governor, with limited executive powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taft|1908|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=rxqmVdt6hKgC 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the Military Governor was continued in those areas where the insurrection persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|2008|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=phT0ympWgeQC&amp;pg=PA2143 2143]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taft Commission passed laws to set up the fundamentals of the new government, including a judicial system, civil service, and local government. A [[Philippine Constabulary]] was organized to deal with the remnants of the insurgent movement and gradually assume the responsibilities of the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Escalante|2007|pp=86–169 (ch. 5, ''Laying the Foundations of Colonial Rule'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insular Government (1902–1935)===
[[Image:US flag 45 stars.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the United States, 1896-1908.]]
The [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act]] was a constitution for the Insular Government, so called because Philippine civil administration was under the authority of the U.S. [[Bureau of Insular Affairs]]. This government saw its mission as one of tutelage, preparing the Philippines for eventual independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 1902 the office of Military Governor was abolished and full executive power passed from [[Adna Chaffee]], the last military governor, to Taft, who became the first U.S. [[Governor-General of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis|2008|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=phT0ympWgeQC&amp;pg=PA2163 2163]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Taft Addressing First Philippine Assembly 1907.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Howard Taft]] addressing the audience at the [[Philippine Assembly]].]]
United States policies towards the Philippines shifted with changing administrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinas&quot;/&gt; During the early years of territorial administration, the Americans were reluctant to delegate authority to the Filipinos, but an elected [[Philippine Assembly]] was inaugurated in 1907, as the lower house of a [[bicameral legislature]], with the appointive Philippine Commission becoming the upper house. When [[Woodrow Wilson]] became [[president of the United States|U.S. President]] in 1913, a new policy was adopted to put into motion a process that would gradually lead to Philippine independence. The [[Jones Act (Philippines)|Jones Act]], passed by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1916 to serve as the new [[organic law]] in the Philippines, promised eventual independence and instituted an elected [[Philippine senate]].

In socio-economic terms, the Philippines made solid progress in this period. Foreign trade had amounted to 62 million pesos in 1895, 13% of which was with the United States.  By 1920, it had increased to 601 million pesos, 66% of which was with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Reyes| first =Jose| title =Legislative history of America's economic policy toward the Philippines| publisher =Columbia University| series =Studies in history, economics and public law| volume =106| edition =2| year =1923| location =| pages =192 of 232| language = | url =http://www.questiaschool.com/read/3845789?title=Legislative%20History%20of%20America's%20Economic%20Policy%20toward%20the%20Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A health care system was established which, by 1930, reduced the [[mortality rate]] from all causes, including various [[tropical disease]]s, to a level similar to that of the United States itself. The practices of [[slavery]], [[piracy]] and [[headhunting]] were suppressed but not entirely extinguished.

A new educational system was established with [[English language|English]] as the medium of instruction, eventually becoming a ''lingua franca'' of the Islands. The 1920s saw alternating periods of cooperation and confrontation with American governors-general, depending on how intent the incumbent was on exercising his powers vis-à-vis the Philippine legislature. Members to the elected legislature lobbied for immediate and complete independence from the United States. Several independence missions were sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] A civil service was formed and was gradually taken over by Filipinos, who had effectively gained control by 1918.

Philippine politics during the American territorial era was dominated by the [[Nacionalista Party]], which was founded in 1907. Although the party's platform called for &quot;immediate independence&quot;, their policy toward the Americans was highly accommodating.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the political establishment, the call for independence was spearheaded by [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who served continuously as [[Senate president]] from 1916 until 1935.

[[Frank Murphy]] was the last [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] (1933–35), and the first U.S. [[High Commissioner of the Philippines]] (1935–36).  The change in form was more than symbolic: it was intended as a manifestation of the transition to independence.

===Commonwealth===
{{Main|Commonwealth of the Philippines}}
[[Image:Quezon Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] with United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The [[Great Depression]] in the early thirties hastened the progress of the Philippines towards independence. In the United States it was mainly the sugar industry and labor unions that had a stake in loosening the U.S. ties to the Philippines since they could not compete with the Philippine cheap sugar (and other commodities) which could freely enter the U.S. market. Therefore, they agitated in favor of granting independence to the Philippines so that its cheap products and labor could be shut out of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Goff, Richard; Moss, Walter G.; Terry, Janice; Upshur, Jiu-Hwa: The Twentieth history: a brief global history, Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1998, pp. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act]] as a Philippine Independence Act over President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the bill had been drafted with the aid of a commission from the Philippines, it was opposed by Philippine Senate President [[Manuel L. Quezon]], partially because of provisions leaving the United States in control of naval bases. Under his influence, the Philippine legislature rejected the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a revised act known as the [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]] was finally passed. The act provided for the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] with a ten-year period of peaceful transition to full independence. The commonwealth would have its own constitution and be self-governing, though foreign policy would be the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required approval of the United States president.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-20&quot;/&gt; The Act stipulated that the date of independence would be on the 4th July following the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth.

A Constitutional Convention was convened in Manila on July 30, 1934. On February 8, 1935, the 1935 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines was approved by the convention by a vote of 177 to 1. The constitution was approved by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on March 23, 1935 and ratified by popular vote on May 14, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090522092815/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions/66-1935-constitution.html 1935 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaide|1994|pp=317–318}} (archived from [http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions/66-1935-constitution.html the original] on 2009-05-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on the morning of November 15, 1935, in ceremonies held on the steps of the [[Old Congress Building, Manila|Legislative Building]] in Manila. The event was attended by a crowd of around 300,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;presidency.ucsb.edu&quot;/&gt; Under the Tydings-McDuffie Act this meant that the date of full independence for the Philippines was set for 4 July 1946, a timetable which was followed after the passage of almost eleven very eventful years.

===World War II and Japanese occupation===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Second Philippine Republic}}
[[Image:Ww2 131.jpg|thumb|left|As many as 10,000 people died in the [[Bataan Death March]].]]
[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched a surprise [[Battle of the Philippines (1942)|attack]] on the Clark Air Base in [[Pampanga]] on December 8, 1941, just ten hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]] on [[Pearl Harbor]]. Aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops on Luzon. The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the [[Bataan Peninsula]] and to the island of [[Corregidor]] at the entrance to Manila Bay.

On January 2, 1942, General MacArthur declared the capital city, Manila, an [[open city]] to prevent its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the [[Bataan Peninsula]] in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at Bataan were forced to undertake the infamous [[Bataan Death March]] to a prison camp 105&amp;nbsp;kilometers to the north. It is estimated that about 10,000 Filipinos and 1,200 Americans died before reaching their destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Quezon and Osmeña had accompanied the troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States, where they set up a government in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur was ordered to Australia, where he started to plan for a return to the Philippines.

The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the [[Philippine Executive Commission]]. They initially organized a [[Philippine Council of State|Council of State]], through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored republic headed by President [[José P. Laurel]] proved to be unpopular.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity.

The occupation of the Philippines by Japan ended at the war's conclusion. The American army had been fighting the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Campaign]] since October 1944, when MacArthur's [[Sixth United States Army]] [[Battle of Leyte|landed]] on [[Leyte]]. Landings in other parts of the country had followed, and the Allies, with the Philippine Commonwealth troops, pushed toward Manila. However, fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on 2 September 1945. The Philippines suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical destruction, specially during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]]. An estimated 1 million Filipinos had been killed, a large portion during the final months of the war, and Manila had been extensively damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-21&quot;/&gt;

===Administration of Manuel Roxas (1946–1948)===
[[File:Manuel Roxas.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Manuel Roxas]], President from 1946 until 1948.]]
Elections were held in April 1946, with [[Manuel Roxas]] becoming the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines. The United States [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|ceded its sovereignty]] over the Philippines on July 4, 1946, as scheduled.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rpustreatyofgeneralrelations.htm|title=Treaty of General Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America|date=July 4, 1946|publisher=Chanrobles law library|accessdate=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Economy of the Philippines|Philippine economy]] remained highly dependent on [[Economy of the United States|United States markets]]– more dependent, according to United States high commissioner [[Paul McNutt]], than any single [[U.S. state]] was dependent on the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-23&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Trade Act]], passed as a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;beterano&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Balitang Beterano: Facts about Philippine Independence|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/tl/tl012375.htm|publisher=Philippine Headline News Online|accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; exacerbated the dependency with provisions further tying the economies of the two countries. A military assistance pact was signed in 1947 granting the United States a 99-year lease on designated [[military base]]s in the country.

===Administration of Elpidio Quirino (1948–1953)===
[[File:Presidentelpidioquirino.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Elpidio Quirino]], president from 1948 until 1953.]]
The Roxas administration granted general [[amnesty]] to those who had collaborated with the Japanese in World War II, except for those who had committed violent crimes. Roxas died suddenly of a heart attack in April 1948, and the vice president, [[Elpidio Quirino]], was elevated to the presidency. He ran for president in his own right in 1949, defeating [[Jose P. Laurel]] and winning a four-year term.

World War II had left the Philippines demoralized and severely damaged. The task of reconstruction was complicated by the activities of the [[Communism|Communist]]-supported [[Hukbalahap]] guerrillas (known as &quot;Huks&quot;), who had evolved into a violent resistance force against the new Philippine government. Government policy towards the Huks alternated between gestures of negotiation and harsh suppression. Secretary of Defense [[Ramon Magsaysay]] initiated a campaign to defeat the insurgents militarily and at the same time win popular support for the government. The Huk movement had waned in the early 1950s, finally ending with the unconditional surrender of Huk leader [[Luis Taruc]] in May 1954.

===Administration of Ramon Magsaysay (1953–1957)===
[[Image:Magsaysay Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|President and Mrs. Magsaysay with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] at the Malacañan Palace.]]
Supported by the United States, Magsaysay was elected president in 1953 on a [[populism|populist]] platform. He promised sweeping economic reform, and made progress in [[land reform]] by promoting the resettlement of poor people in the Catholic north into traditionally Muslim areas. Though this relieved population pressure in the north, it heightened religious hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was extremely popular with the common people, and his death in an [[1957 Cebu Douglas C-47 crash|airplane crash]] in March 1957 dealt a serious blow to national morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809261,00.html |title=THE PHILIPPINES: Death of a Friend |date=March 25, 1957 |publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Carlos P Garcia.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Carlos P. Garcia]], president of the [[Philippines]] from 1957 until 1961.]]
[[Carlos P. Garcia]] succeeded to the presidency after Magsaysay's death, and was elected to a four-year term in the election of November that same year. His administration emphasized the nationalist theme of &quot;Filipino first&quot;, arguing that the Filipino people should be given the chances to improve the country's economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgarcia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Carlos Garcia: Unheralded nationalist |url=http://www.philippinenews.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=555a3972999c72ad3bc05bbadf8225f6 |publisher=Philippine News Online |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061026052206/http://www.philippinenews.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=555a3972999c72ad3bc05bbadf8225f6 |archivedate=2006-10-26 |accessdate=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia successfully negotiated for the United States' relinquishment of large military land reservations. However, his administration lost popularity on issues of government corruption as his term advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration of Diosdado Macapagal (1961–1965)===
[[File: Diosdado Macapagal USS Oklahoma City 1962 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Diosdado Macapagal]], president of the [[Philippines]] from 1961 until 1965.]]
In the presidential elections held on November 14, 1963, Vice President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] defeated re-electionist President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] and [[Emmanuel Pelaez]] as a Vice President. President [[Macapagal]] was the [[President of the Philippines]] that changed the independence day of the [[Philippines]] from July 4 to June 12.

====Land Reform Code====
{{main|Agricultural Land Reform Code}}
The '''Agricultural Land Reform Code''' (RA 3844) was a major [[Philippine]] [[land reform]] law enacted in 1963 under President [[Diosdado Macapagal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1963/ra_3844_1963.html|title=Republic Act No. 3844 : The Agricultural Land Reform Code of the Philippines|date=August 8, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code declared that it was State policy

#To establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family-size farm as the basis of Philippine agriculture and, as a consequence, divert landlord capital in agriculture to industrial development;
#To achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers free from pernicious institutional restraints and practices;
#To create a truly viable social and economic structure in agriculture conducive to greater productivity and higher farm incomes;
#To apply all labor laws equally and without discrimination to both industrial and agricultural wage earners;
#To provide a more vigorous and systematic land resettlement program and public land distribution; and
#To make the small farmers more independent, self-reliant and responsible citizens, and a source of genuine strength in our democratic society.

and, in pursuance of those policies, established the following
#An agricultural leasehold system to replace all existing share tenancy systems in agriculture;
#A declaration of rights for agricultural labor;
#An authority for the acquisition and equitable distribution of agricultural land;
#An institution to finance the acquisition and distribution of agricultural land;
#A machinery to extend credit and similar assistance to agriculture;
#A machinery to provide marketing, management, and other technical services to agriculture;
#A unified administration for formulating and implementing projects of land reform;
#An expanded program of land capability survey, classification, and registration; and
#A judicial system to decide issues arising under this Code and other related laws and regulations.

====MAPHILINDO====
{{main|MAPHILINDO}}

[[Maphilindo]] was a proposed nonpolitical confederation of Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia. It was based on concepts developed during the Commonwealth government in the Philippines by [[Wenceslao Vinzons]] and by Eduardo L. Martelino in his 1959 book ''Someday, Malaysia&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo L. Martelino|title=Someday Malaysia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y4g9AAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Pageant Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal of the Philippines convened a summit meeting in Manila. Maphilindo was proposed as a realization of Jose Rizal's dream of bringing together the Malay peoples. However, this was  perceived as a tactic on the parts of Jakarta and Manila to delay or prevent the formation of the [[Federation of Malaysia]]. The plan failed when Indonesian President [[Sukarno]] adopted his plan of [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]] with Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Poulgrain|title=The genesis of konfrontasi: Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, 1945-1965|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S3eCr4q02RcC|year=1998|publisher=Crawford House|isbn=978-1-85065-513-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marcos era and martial law (1965–1986)==
{{Main|History of the Philippines (1965–1986)}}
[[Image:CongressBuilding SEATO.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The leaders of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] nations in front of the Congress Building in [[Manila, Philippines|Manila]], hosted by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos on October 24, 1966.

Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu (South Vietnam), Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn (Thailand), President Lyndon B. Johnson (United States)]]

Macapagal ran for re-election in 1965, but was defeated by his former [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|party]]-mate, Senate President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who had switched to the [[Nacionalista Party]]. Early in his presidency, Marcos initiated ambitious public works projects and intensified tax collection which brought the country economic prosperity throughout the 1970s. His administration built more roads (including a substantial portion of the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]]) than all his predecessors combined, and more schools than any previous administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos was re-elected president in 1969, becoming the first president of the independent Philippines to achieve a second term.

The Philippine Legislature was corrupt and impotent. Opponents of Marcos blocked the necessary legislation to implement his ambitious plans. Because of this, optimism faded early in his second term and economic growth slowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime and civil disobedience increased. The [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] formed the [[New People's Army]]. The [[Moro National Liberation Front]] continued to fight for an independent Muslim nation in Mindanao. An explosion during the proclamation rally of the senatorial slate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] on August 21, 1971 prompted Marcos to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]], which he restored on January 11, 1972 after public protests.

===Martial law===
Amidst the rising wave of lawlessness and the threat of a Communist insurgency, Marcos declared [[martial law]] on September 23, 1972 by virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081]]. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics senators [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and [[Jose Diokno]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration of martial law was initially well received, given the social turmoil the Philippines was experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime rates plunged dramatically after a curfew was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political opponents were forced to go into exile.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], which had been called for in 1970 to replace the colonial [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and allowing Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973.

Marcos claimed that martial law was the prelude to creating a &quot;New Society&quot; based on new social and political values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=574–575}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy during the 1970s was robust, with budgetary and trade surpluses. The [[Gross National Product]] rose from P55 billion in 1972 to P193 billion in 1980. Tourism rose, contributing to the economy's growth. However, Marcos, his cronies, and his wife, [[Imelda Romualdez-Marcos]], willfully engaged in rampant corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-pro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Philippines, March 2006|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Republic===
Appeasing the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In many tongues, pope championed religious freedoms|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/03/Worldandnation/In_many_tongues__pope.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos officially lifted martial law on January 17, 1981. However, he retained much of the government's power for arrest and detention. Corruption and nepotism as well as civil unrest contributed to a serious decline in economic growth and development under Marcos, whose health declined due to [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]].

The political opposition boycotted the [[Philippine general election, 1981|1981 presidential elections]], which pitted Marcos against retired general [[Alejo Santos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-28&quot;/&gt; Marcos won by a margin of over 16 million votes, which constitutionally allowed him to have another six-year term. Finance Minister [[Cesar Virata]] was appointed as Prime Minister by Marcos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sp3U1oCNKlgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=cesar+virata+prime+minister+1981+batasang#v=onepage&amp;q=cesar%20virata%20prime%20minister%201981%20batasang&amp;f=false|page=75|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: the political economy of authoritarianism|first=Albert|last=Celoza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997|isbn=978-0-275-94137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was assassinated at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]] upon his return to the Philippines after a long period of exile.  This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos and began a succession of events, including pressure from the United States, that culminated in a snap [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|presidential election]] in February 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition united under Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]].

The official election canvasser, the [[Commission on Elections]] (Comelec), declared Marcos the winner of the election. However, there was a large discrepancy between the Comelec results and that of [[Namfrel]], an accredited poll watcher. The allegedly fraudulent result was rejected by Corazon Aquino and her supporters. International observers, including a U.S. delegation, denounced the official results.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-29&quot;/&gt; General [[Fidel Ramos]] and Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] withdrew their support for Marcos. A peaceful civilian-military uprising, now popularly called the [[People Power Revolution]], forced Marcos into exile and installed Corazon Aquino as president on February 25, 1986.

[[Image:Pinatubo ash plume 910612.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Pinatubo]] erupted in 1991.]]
Corazon Aquino immediately formed a revolutionary government to normalize the situation, and provided for a transitional &quot;[[Constitution of the Philippines#1986 amendments|Freedom Constitution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new permanent constitution was ratified and enacted in February 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution crippled presidential power to declare martial law, proposed the creation of autonomous regions in the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordilleras]] and [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Muslim Mindanao]], and restored the presidential form of government and the bicameral Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;usdos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Notes: Philippines, November 1996|url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/eap/philippines9611.html|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress was made in revitalizing democratic institutions and respect for civil liberties, but Aquino's administration was also viewed as weak and fractious, and a return to full political stability and economic development was hampered by several attempted coups staged by disaffected members of the Philippine military.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-cory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Then &amp; Now: Corazon Aquino|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/09/19/cnn25.aquino.tan/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic growth was additionally hampered by a series of natural disasters, including the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] that left 700 dead and 200,000 homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinatubo - Eruption Features|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/stratoguide/pinfeat.html|publisher=National Geophysical Data Center|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Aquino presidency, Manila witnessed six unsuccessful coup attempts, the most serious occurring in December 1989.&lt;ref name=RiggsInFarazmand1994pp129-130&gt;{{Harvnb|Farazmand|1994|pp=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=8NBc_QT26ZoC&amp;pg=PA129 129–130]|Ref=CITEREFRiggs1994}} (footnote 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected a treaty that would have allowed a 10-year extension of the U.S. military bases in the country. The United States turned over [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Pampanga]] to the government in November, and [[Subic Bay Naval Base]] in [[Zambales]] in December 1992, ending almost a century of U.S. military presence in the Philippines.

===Administration of Fidel V. Ramos (1992–1998)===
In the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 elections]], Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]], endorsed by Aquino, won the presidency with just 23.6% of the vote in a field of seven candidates. Early in his administration, Ramos declared &quot;national reconciliation&quot; his highest priority and worked at building a coalition to overcome the divisiveness of the Aquino years.&lt;ref name=&quot;usdos&quot;/&gt; He legalized the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Communist Party]] and laid the groundwork for talks with communist insurgents, [[Muslim]] separatists, and military rebels, attempting to convince them to cease their armed activities against the government. In June 1994, Ramos signed into law a general conditional [[amnesty]] covering all rebel groups, and Philippine military and police personnel accused of crimes committed while fighting the insurgents. In October 1995, the government signed an agreement bringing the military insurgency to an end. A peace agreement with the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF), a major separatist group fighting for an independent homeland in [[Mindanao]], was signed in 1996, ending the 24-year old struggle. However, an MNLF splinter group, the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] continued the armed struggle for an Islamic state. Efforts by Ramos supporters to gain passage of an amendment that would allow him to run for a second term were met with large-scale protests, leading Ramos to declare he would not seek re-election.&lt;ref name=&quot;asiaweek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Showdown in Manila |url=http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1003/nat1.html |publisher=Asiaweek |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061110215216/http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1003/nat1.html

[[Joseph Estrada]], a former movie actor who had served as Ramos' vice president, was elected president by a landslide victory in 1998.

The economy did, however, recover from a low &amp;minus;0.6% growth in 1998 to a moderate growth of 3.4% by 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio C.

The process is termed as CONCORD or Constitutional Correction for Development. Unlike Charter change under Ramos and Arroyo the CONCORD proposal, according to its proponents, would only amend the 'restrictive' economic provisions of the constitution that is considered as impeding the entry of more foreign investments in the Philippines. However it was not successful in amending the constitution.

On March 21, 2000 President Estrada declared an &quot;all-out-war&quot; against the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) after the worsening secessionist movement in Midanao&lt;ref name=Erap2008-09-18&gt;[http://hdn.org.ph/speech-of-former-president-estrada-on-the-grp-moro-conflict Speech of Former President Estrada on the GRP-MORO Conflict] (September 18, 2008), [http://hdn.org.ph/ Human development Network].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/moro.cfm In the Spotlight : Moro Islamic Liberation Front], Center for defense Information Terrorism Project, February 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The government later captured 46 MILF camps including the MILF's headquarters', Camp Abubakar.&lt;ref name=Erap2008-09-18 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters], People's Daily, July 10, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/8068 AFP-MILF 2000 War in Mindanao Remembered] (April 13, 2006), American Chronicle, May 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, however, Estrada was accused of having accepted millions of pesos in payoffs from illegal gambling businesses. He was [[impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Representatives, but his impeachment trial in the Senate broke down when the senate voted to block examination of the president's bank records. In response, [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|massive street protests]] erupted demanding Estrada's resignation. Faced with street protests, cabinet resignations, and a withdrawal of support from the armed forces, Estrada was forced from office on January 20, 2001.

===Administration of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001–2010)===
Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] (the daughter of the late President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]) was sworn in as Estrada's successor on the day of his departure. Her accession to power was further legitimized by the mid-term congressional and local elections held four months later, when her coalition won an overwhelming victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-pro&quot;/&gt; Arroyo's initial term in office was marked by fractious coalition politics as well as a military mutiny in Manila in July 2003 that led her to declare a month-long nationwide state of rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-pro&quot;/&gt;

Arroyo had declared in December 2002 that she would not run in the May 2004 presidential election, but she reversed herself in October 2003 and decided to join the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;uslc-pro&quot;/&gt; She was re-elected and sworn in for her own six-year term as president on June 30, 2004. In 2005, a tape of a wiretapped conversation surfaced bearing the voice of Arroyo apparently asking an election official if her margin of victory could be maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-trans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria Macapagal Arroyo Talkasia Transcript|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/talkasia.arroyo.script/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape sparked protests calling for Arroyo's resignation.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-trans&quot;/&gt; Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to an election official, but denied allegations of fraud and refused to step down.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-trans&quot;/&gt; Attempts to impeach the president failed later that year.

Arroyo unsuccessfully attempted a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present presidential-bicameral republic into a federal parliamentary-unicameral form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Lira|last=Dalangin-Fernandez|url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|title=People's support for Charter change 'nowhere to go but up'|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2006-07-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060727190950/http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106 |archivedate = July 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
