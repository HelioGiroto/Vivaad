United States Naval Institute, ''Proceedings'', 81 (December 1955), pp.1315–1331&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Battle of Pearl Harbor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morison|2001|pp=101, 120, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a surprise [[military strike]] conducted by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] against the United States [[naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan). The attack was intended as a [[preventive war|preventive]] action in order to keep the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from interfering with military actions the [[Empire of Japan]] was planning in [[Southeast Asia]] against overseas territories of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], and the United States.

The base was attacked by 353&lt;ref name=&quot;parillo288&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Parillo|2006|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;parillo288&quot;/&gt; All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four being sunk.  Of these eight damaged, two were raised, and with four repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three [[cruiser]]s, three [[destroyer]]s, an anti-aircraft training ship,{{#tag:Ref|[[USS Utah (BB-31)|USS ''Utah'']] (AG-16, formerly BB-31); the ''Utah'' was moored in the space intended to have been occupied by the carrier ''Enterprise'' which, returning with a task force, had been expected to enter the channel at 0730 on 7 December. Strong headwinds delayed the refueling of the destroyers, and the task force didn't reach Pearl Harbor until dusk the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|2007|pp=57–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} and one [[minelayer]]. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,402 Americans were killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usswestvirginia.org/ph/phlist.php |title=Full Pearl Harbor casualty list |publisher=Usswestvirginia.org |date=|accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,282 wounded. The power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the [[Station Hypo|intelligence section]]) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five [[midget submarine]]s lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. [[Kazuo Sakamaki|One Japanese sailor]] was captured.

The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into [[World War II]] in both the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] and [[European Theatre of World War II|European theaters]]. The following day (December 8), the United States [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|declared war]] on Japan. Domestic support for [[United_States_non-interventionism#Isolationism_shortly_before_WWII|non-interventionism]], which had been strong,&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Selig. The Isolationist Impulse: Its Twentieth Century Reaction. New York: The Free Press, 1957 p.239-258&lt;/ref&gt; disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (for example the [[Neutrality Patrol]]) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to [[Axis Powers#Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States|declare war]] on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.

There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to proclaim December 7, 1941, &quot;a date which will live in infamy&quot;. {{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Background to conflict==
{{Main|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}

===Anticipating war===
The attack on Pearl Harbor was intended to neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and hence protect Japan's advance into [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]], where she sought access to [[natural resource]]s such as [[petroleum|oil]] and rubber. War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility each nation had been aware of (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria]]. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to [[Second Sino-Japanese War|all-out war]] in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the &quot;Southern Operation&quot; was designed to assist these efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnhart 1987&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnhart|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on the [[USS Panay incident|USS ''Panay'']] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] (more than 200,000 killed in indiscriminate massacres) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion,&lt;ref&gt;Werner Gruhl (2007). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931-1945]''. Transaction Publishers. p.39. ISBN 978-0-7658-0352-8&lt;/ref&gt; which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

In 1940, Japan [[Invasion of French Indochina|invaded French Indochina]] in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, [[machine tool]]s, and [[Avgas|aviation gasoline]], which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act.{{#tag:Ref|After it was announced in September iron and steel scrap export would also be prohibited, Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi protested to Secretary Hull on October 8, 1940 warning this might be considered an &quot;unfriendly act&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PaW-96&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=96|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil,&lt;ref name=&quot;PaW-94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=94|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toland, ''Japan's War''.{{clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likely to be considered a provocation by Japan.

Early in 1941,&lt;!--February?--&gt; [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in [[San Diego]] and ordered a military buildup in the [[Philippines]] in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain any attack on the British Southeast Asian colonies would bring the U.S. into the war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; An invasion of the Philippines was also considered to be necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. [[War Plan Orange]] had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000 man elite force. This was opposed by [[Douglas MacArthur#Field Marshal of the Philippine Army|Douglas MacArthur]], who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=William Chalek|title=Guest of the Emperor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=30KUgALzEF8C|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-23996-2|chapter-url=http://books.google.com/books?id=30KUgALzEF8C&amp;pg=PA45|chapter=8. War Plan Orange|pages=45–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to [[Admiral]] [[Thomas C. Hart|Thomas Hart]], commander of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Edward S.

[[Image:Pearl Harbor looking southwest-Oct41.jpg|thumb|left|Pearl Harbor on October 30, 1941.]]

The U.S. ceased [[History of Petroleum|oil exports]] to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;PaW-125&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|GPO|1943|p=125|Ref=CITEREFGPO1943a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory.{{#Tag:Ref|This was mainly a Japanese Navy preference; the Japanese Army would have chosen to attack the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}; Coox, ''Kobun''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of South East Asia.

Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the &quot;Southern Resource Area&quot; (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], then commanding Japan's [[Combined Fleet]].&lt;ref name=Gailey1995p68&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.&lt;ref name=Gailey1995p70&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1995|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Captain [[Minoru Genda]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Japanese planning staff studied the [[Battle of Taranto|1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet]] at [[Taranto]] intensively. It was of great use to them when planning their attack on U.S. naval forces in Pearl Harbor.{{#Tag:Ref|&quot;The Dorn report did not state with certainty that Kimmel and Short knew about Taranto. There is, however, no doubt that they did know, as did the Japanese. Lt. Cdr. Takeshi Naito, the assistant [[Military attaché|naval attaché]] to Berlin, flew to Taranto to investigate the attack first hand, and Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Cdr. [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] about his observations. Fuchida led the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Borch|Martinez|2005|pp=53–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}{{#Tag:Ref|&quot;A [[torpedo bomber]] needed a long, level flight, and when released, its conventional torpedo would plunge nearly a hundred feet deep before swerving upward to strike a hull. Pearl Harbor deep averages 42 feet. But the Japanese borrowed an idea from the British carrier-based torpedo raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto. They fashioned auxiliary wooden tail fins to keep the torpedoes horizontal, so they would dive to only 35 feet, and they added a breakaway &quot;nosecone&quot; of soft wood to cushion the impact with the surface of the water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hellions of the Deep: The Development of American Torpedoes in World War II.'' By Robert Gannon, Published by Penn State Press, 1996, page 49.ISBN 0-271-01508-X&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Over the next several months, pilots trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence collected. Despite these preparations, the attack plan was not approved by [[Emperor Hirohito]] until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wetzler|1998|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the &quot;[[Hull Note]]&quot; would &quot;destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=417}}, citing the Sugiyama memo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A [[Gallup poll]] just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not expect war, and 21% had no opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cipo19411208&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPcuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s9sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5721%2C1471377 | title=Gallup Poll Found 52p.c. of Americans Expected War | work=Ottawa Citizen | date=1941-12-08 | accessdate=November 28, 2011 | author=The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on multiple occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target. They expected the Philippines to be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]] in the 1890s. Manchester, William. ''[[American Caesar]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectives===
The attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 [[Two-Ocean Navy Act|Vinson-Walsh Act]] erased any chance of victory.&lt;ref name=Willmott14&gt;{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shigeru Fukudome|Fukudome, Shigeru]]. ''Shikan: Shinjuwan Kogeki'' (Tokyo, 1955), p.150.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was meant to deliver a severe blow to American morale, one which would discourage Americans from committing to a war extending into the western Pacific Ocean and Dutch East Indies. To maximize the effect on morale, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time. The overall intention was to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference.&lt;ref name=Willmott14/&gt;

Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on [[shore leave]] or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantage—this of timing, and known to the Japanese—was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers ({{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). Ironically, the IJN top command was so imbued with [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Admiral Mahan]]'s &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine—especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships—that, despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.

Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short, victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms, and submarine base, could safely be ignored, since—by their thinking—the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach and attack==
{{See also|Order of battle of the Attack on Pearl Harbor}}

[[Image:PearlHarborCarrierChart.jpg|thumb|right|Route followed by the Japanese fleet to Pearl Harbor and back]]

On November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the [[Kido Butai|Striking Force]]) of six aircraft carriers (''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'', ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]'', ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Sōryū]]'', ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|Hiryū]]'', ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|Shōkaku]]'', and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'') departed northern Japan ''en route'' to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor. In all, 408 aircraft were intended to be used: 360 for the two attack waves, 48 on defensive [[combat air patrol]] (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.
[[File:A6M2 on carrier Akagi 1941.jpeg|thumb|right|An Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zero&quot; fighter on the aircraft carrier ''Akagi''.]]
The first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to finish whatever tasks remained. The first wave contained the bulk of the weapons to attack [[capital ships]], mainly specially adapted [[Type 91 torpedo|Type 91]] [[aerial torpedo]]es which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a [[rudder]] extension that let them operate in shallow water.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Peattie|2001}} p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets (battleships and [[aircraft carrier]]s) or, if these were not present, any other high value ships (cruisers and destroyers). [[Dive bomber]]s were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to counterattack the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed, especially over US airfields.

Before the attack commenced, two [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] launched from cruisers were sent to scout over Oahu and report on enemy fleet composition and location.

===Japanese declaration of war===
{{See also|Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire}}
The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hixson|2003|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=CAEyh6EY9kYC&amp;pg=PA73 73]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi ''et al.'', ''The Penguin History of the Second World War'', p.952&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese tried to uphold the conventions of war while still achieving surprise, but the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5,000-word notification (commonly called the &quot;14-Part Message&quot;) in two blocks to the [[Japanese Ambassador to the United States|Japanese Embassy in Washington]], but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)&lt;ref&gt;Toland, ''Infamy''&lt;/ref&gt; The final part of the &quot;14 Part Message&quot; is sometimes described as a declaration of war.  While it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations, it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator that negotiations were likely to be terminated &lt;ref&gt;At Dawn We Slept Prange, Goldstein. Dillon - page 424 &amp; page 475&lt;/ref&gt; and that war might break out at any moment.&lt;ref&gt;At Dawn We Slept, Prange, Goldstein. Dillon – page 493-494&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/Rescript-English.pdf Declaration of War handout] Retrieved August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.

For decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without any official warning of a break in relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, &quot;our deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.&quot; Of this, Iguchi said, &quot;The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations ... [a]nd they clearly prevailed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/pearl-harbor-truly-a-sneak-attack-papers-show.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Pearl Harbor Truly a Sneak Attack, Papers Show |author=Howard W.

As the first wave approached Oahu, a U.S. Army [[SCR-270 radar|SCR-270]] [[radar]] at [[Opana Radar Site|Opana Point]] near the island's northern tip (a post not yet operational, having been in training mode for months) detected it and called in a warning. Radar had been in use in a training mode by the U.S Army Hawaiian Department for some time, but was not fully operational.&lt;ref&gt;At Dawn We Slept Prange, Goldstein. Dillon page 730-31 ‘Short mishandled radar...’ In his (Short’s) words ‘... more for training than any idea it would be real’&lt;/ref&gt; Although the operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard,&lt;ref&gt;The American Century, Harold Evans,Jonathan Cape, London,1998 p.309&lt;/ref&gt; reported a target, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, Lieutenant [[Kermit A. Tyler]], presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers. The direction from which the aircraft were coming was close (only a few degrees separated the two inbound courses),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prange|1999|p=98}}{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=no full cite present; unable to identify (Prange 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar;&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', p.500.&lt;/ref&gt; they neglected to tell Tyler of its size,&lt;ref name=&quot;prange501&quot;&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', p.501.&lt;/ref&gt; while Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell them the B-17s were due&lt;ref name=&quot;prange501&quot;/&gt; (even though it was widely known).&lt;ref name=&quot;prange501&quot;/&gt;

Several U.S. aircraft were shot down as the first wave approached land, and one at least radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless, it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly. The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor, though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked at Pearl.

The air portion of the attack on Pearl Harbor began at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al''.

Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main U.S. Army Air Force fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Air Corps' [[Bellows Field]] near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and [[Ford Island]]. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of [[P-36 Hawk]]s, [[P-40 Warhawk]]s and some [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers from the carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']].{{#Tag:Ref|In the twenty-five sorties flown, USAF Historical Study No.85 credits six pilots with ten planes destroyed: 1st Lt Lewis M.

===Second wave composition===
The second wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Shigekazu Shimazaki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IJN&quot;/&gt; Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; This wave and its targets comprised:&lt;ref name=&quot;IJN&quot;/&gt;

* '''3rd Group''' – (targets: aircraft at Ford Island, Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, Barber’s Point, Kaneohe)
**36 A6Ms for defense and strafing
The second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kāne{{okina}}ohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.

Ninety minutes after it began, the attack was over. 2,386 Americans died (55 were civilians, most killed by unexploded American anti-aircraft shells landing in civilian areas), a further 1,139 wounded. Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships.{{#tag:Ref|Navy and Marines: 2,117 killed in action or died of wounds, 779 wounded; Army 215 killed in action or died of wounds, 360 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmyChapter7pg194&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Conn|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearl Harbor Congress Report Pg64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|GPO|1946|pp=64–65|Ref=CITEREFGPO1946a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|200|left|USS Arizona (BB-39) during the attack]]
Of the American fatalities, nearly half of the total (1,177) were due to the explosion of [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|''Arizona'']]'s forward [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] after it was hit by a modified 40&amp;nbsp;cm (16 in.) shell.{{#Tag:Ref|The wreck has become a [[USS Arizona Memorial|memorial]] to those lost that day, most of whom remain within the ship. She continues to leak small amounts of [[fuel oil]], over 60 years after the attack.|group=nb}}

Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, ''Nevada'' attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250&amp;nbsp;lb (113&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance.

[[USS California (BB-44)|''California'']] was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from ''Arizona'' and ''West Virginia'' drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed [[target ship]] [[USS Utah (BB-31)|''Utah'']] was holed twice by torpedoes. [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|''West Virginia'']] was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|''Oklahoma'']] was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her [[belt armor]], which caused her to [[capsize]]. [[USS Maryland (BB-46)|''Maryland'']] was hit by two of the converted 40&amp;nbsp;cm shells, but neither caused serious damage.

Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The [[light cruiser]] [[USS Helena (CL-50)|''Helena'']] was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer [[USS Oglala (CM-4)|''Oglala'']]. Two destroyers in [[dry dock]], [[USS Cassin (DD-372)|''Cassin'']] and [[USS Downes (DD-375)|''Downes'']] were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel [[Bunker fuel|bunker]]s. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. ''Cassin'' slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against ''Downes''. The light cruiser [[USS Raleigh (CL-7)|''Raleigh'']] was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser [[USS Honolulu (CL-48)|''Honolulu'']] was damaged but remained in service. The repair vessel [[USS Vestal (AR-4)|''Vestal'']], moored alongside ''Arizona'', was heavily damaged and beached. The [[seaplane tender]] [[USS Curtiss (AV-4)|''Curtiss'']] was also damaged. The destroyer [[USS Shaw (DD-373)|''Shaw'']] was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USS Shaw (DD-373)|Ref=CITEREFdanfs373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friendly fire]] brought down some U.S. planes on top of that, including five from an inbound flight from [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']]. Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel.

Fifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the action, and one was captured.

Several Japanese junior officers, including [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] and [[Minoru Genda]], the chief architect of the attack, urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor's fuel and torpedo{{#Tag:Ref|In the event, loss of these might have been a net benefit to the U.S. Blair, ''passim''.|group=nb}} storage, maintenance, and dry dock facilities as possible;&lt;ref name=Gailey1997p68&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1997|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the captains of the other five carriers in the formation reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Horn, The Second Attack on Pearl Harbor: Operation K and Other Japanese Attempts to Bomb America in World War II, 2005, (Naval Institute Press), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Military historians have suggested the destruction of these would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than loss of its battleships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}; Blair, ''Silent Victory''.&lt;/ref&gt; If they had been wiped out, &quot;serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year&quot;;&lt;ref name=Gailey1997pp97-98&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1997|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to American Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, &quot;it would have prolonged the war another two years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yergin327&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Yergin|first=Daniel|title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=1991|isbn=0-671-79932-0}} p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Nagumo, however, decided to withdraw for several reasons:

*American anti-aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike, and two thirds of Japan's losses were incurred during the second wave.&lt;ref name=Hoyt190&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoyt|2000|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike, he would be risking three quarters of the Combined Fleet's strength to wipe out the remaining targets (which included the facilities) while suffering higher aircraft losses.&lt;ref name=Hoyt190/&gt;
*The location of the American carriers remained unknown. In addition, the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land-based bombers.&lt;ref name=Hoyt190/&gt; Nagumo was uncertain whether the U.S. had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoyt|2000|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time, and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night. At the time, only the (British) Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques, so this was a substantial risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;steven&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephen | first = Martin | title = Sea Battles in Close-up: World War 2 | location = Shepperton, Surrey | publisher = Ian Allan | year = 1988 | pages = 34–38 | volume = Volume 1  | isbn = 0-7110-1596-1 | coauthors = Grove, Eric (Ed)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The task force's fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer, since he was at the very limit of logistical support. To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel, perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prange|1999}}{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=no full cite present; unable to identify (Prange 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*He believed the second strike had essentially satisfied the main objective of his mission—the neutralization of the Pacific Fleet—and did not wish to risk further losses.&lt;ref name=Gailey1997p97&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1997|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it was Japanese Navy practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a conference aboard ''Yamato'' the following morning, Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo.&lt;ref name=Gailey1997p97 /&gt; In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and oil depots meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.&lt;ref name=Gailey1997p98&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailey|1997|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvage==
[[Image:NH64486 Wallin aboard BB-44.jpg|thumb|left|Captain [[Homer N. Wallin]] (center) supervises salvage operations aboard [[USS California (BB-44)|USS ''California'']], early 1942]]

After a systematic search for survivors, formal salvage operations began. Captain [[Homer N. Wallin]], Material Officer for Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations. &quot;Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pearl Harbor: Why, How Fleet Salvage &amp; Final Appraisal, Wallin, Homer Naval History Division 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{#Tag:Ref|Commander [[Edward Ellsberg]] was ordered to [[Massawa]] as his replacement, to assist the British in clearing [[Scuttling|scuttled]] Italian and German ships.

Around Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the [[Shipyard|Naval Shipyard]], and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships. Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.

Intensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.&lt;ref&gt;Raymer, E.C: &quot;Descent Into Darkness&quot;, Presidio Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oklahoma'', while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947.  ''Arizona'' and the target ship ''Utah'' were too heavily damaged for salvage, though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels. Today, the two hulks remain where they were sunk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/bb37usa/postattacksalvageI.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027095237/http://geocities.com/bb37usa/postattacksalvageI.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Post-attack ship salvage 1942–1944 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Arizona'' becoming a [[USS Arizona Memorial|war memorial]].

In the wake of the attack, 15 [[Congressional Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]], 51 [[Navy Cross]]es, 53 [[Silver Star]]s, four [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]]s, one [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], four [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]es, one [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]], and three [[Bronze Star Medal]]s were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p={{page needed|date=September 2010}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]], the [[Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal]], was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.

The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous [[Infamy Speech]] to a [[Joint Session of Congress]], calling for a [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan]]. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11 Germany and Italy, honoring their commitments under the Tripartite Pact, declared war on the United States.  The Tripartite Pact was an earlier agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan which had the principal objective of limiting U.S. intervention in any conflicts involving the three nations.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Second World War, Liddell Hart, B.H. page 206&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. Britain actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the US did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war &quot;within the hour&quot; of a Japanese attack on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772812,00.html | work=Time | title=The U.S. At War, The Last Stage | date=December 15, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|attacked the Philippines]] hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines).  Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were sunk]] off the coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]], causing British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] later to recollect &quot;In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Churchill War Papers: The Ever-Widening War |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |coauthors=Martin Gilbert |volume=Volume 3: 1941 |year=2001 |publisher=W.W.

One further consequence of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the [[Niihau Incident]]) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby [[Japanese-American internment]] camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as [[Sand Island (Hawaii)|Sand Island]] at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and [[Kilauea Military Camp]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiiinternment.org/history-of-internment |title=World War II Internment in Hawai'i |publisher=Education through Cultural &amp; Historical Organizations |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, E. (1995). A fence away from freedom: Japanese Americans and World War II. New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, over 110,000 Japanese Americans, including United States citizens, were removed from their homes and transferred to internment camps in California, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearlharboroahu.com/after.htm] Pearl Harbor Oahu website, retrieved on November 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, R.

===Niihau Incident===
[[File:Nishikaichi's Zero BII-120.jpg|thumb|Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi's aircraft shown ten days after it crashed]]
{{Main|Niihau Incident}}
The Japanese planners had determined that some means of rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers was required.  The island of Niihau, only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.

The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, and he flew to the rescue point on Niihau. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiian inhabitants, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's maps and other documents. The island’s residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of two Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed, one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife was sent to prison.

The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents apparently went to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.

===Strategic implications===
Admiral [[Tadaichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, &quot;We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Haufler, Herve. ''Codebreaker's Victory: How the Allied Cryptographers Won World War II'' (New York: NAL, 2003), quoted p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; While the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. instead adopted &quot;[[Plan Dog]]&quot; in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack, otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or so (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines—the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively slow speed limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles. A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a &quot;decisive battle&quot; that never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

Ultimately, targets not on Genda's list, such as the submarine base and the old headquarters building, proved more important than any battleship. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy's heavy ships and brought Japan's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials: import of raw materials was down by half what it had been at the end of 1942, &quot;to a disastrous ten million tons&quot;, while oil import &quot;was almost completely stopped&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, pp.360 &amp; 816.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the [[Station HYPO|cryptanalytic unit]] which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force's success.

===Present day===
Today, the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] on the island of Oahu honors the lives lost on the day of the attack. Visitors to the memorial reach it via boats from the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Alfred Preis is the architect responsible for the memorial's design. The structure has a sagging center and its ends strong and vigorous. It commemorates &quot;initial defeat and ultimate victory&quot; of all lives lost on December 7, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/pearl_harbor/aftermath.shtml] Glencoe Online website, retrieved on November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although December 7 is known as Pearl Harbor Day, it is not considered a federal holiday in the United States. The nation does however, continue to pay homage remembering the thousands injured and killed when attacked by the Japanese in 1941. Schools and other establishments across the country respectfully lower the American flag to half-staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://24sevenpost.com/world-news/4-key-facts-pearl-harbor-day-december-7-1941/] 24SevenPost website, December 7, 2010. retrieved on November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), an adaptation of the [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] novel set in Hawaii on the eve of the attack.
*''[[In Harm's Way]]'' (1965), director [[Otto Preminger]]'s adaptation of the [[James Bassett (author)|James Bassett]] novel, which opens on December 6, 1941, in Hawaii, and depicts the attack from the point of view of the men of a ship able to leave the harbor.
*''[[Storm Over the Pacific (film)|Storm Over the Pacific]]'', also known as ''Hawai Middouei daikaikusen: Taiheiyo no arashi'' (Hawaii-Midway Battle of the Sea and Sky: Storm in the Pacific Ocean) and ''[[I Bombed Pearl Harbor]]'' (1961), produced by the Japanese studio [[Toho Company]] and starring [[Toshiro Mifune]], tells the story of Japanese airmen who served in the Pearl Harbor Raid and the Battle of Midway. An edited version dubbed into English as ''[[I Bombed Pearl Harbor]]'' was given U.S. release in 1961.&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;
*''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' (1970), a Japan-U.S. coproduction about the attack is &quot;meticulous&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernardelli, James, [http://www.reelviews.net/movies/t/tora.html &quot;''Tora! Tora! Tora!'' film review&quot;], ReelViews.net&lt;/ref&gt; in its approach to dissecting the situation leading up to the bombing. It depicts the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor from both American and Japanese points of view, with scrupulous attention to historical fact, including the U.S. use of ''[[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]'' [[cryptanalysis]].
* ''[[Pearl (miniseries)|Pearl]]'' (1978), a TV [[miniseries]], written by [[Stirling Silliphant]], about events leading up to the attack.
*''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), director [[Steven Spielberg]] comedy about a panicked [[Los Angeles]] immediately after the attack.

*''[[The Winds of War]]'', a novel by American writer [[Herman Wouk]], was written between 1963 and 1971. The novel finishes in December 1941 with the aftermath of the attack. The TV miniseries based on the book was produced by Dan Curtis, airing in 1984. It starred [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Ali MacGraw]], with [[Ralph Bellamy]] as President Roosevelt.
*''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Bay]], a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack and its aftermath.

===Non-fiction/historical===
*''The Attack on Pearl Harbor: An Illustrated History'' by Larry Kimmett and Margaret Regis is a careful recreation of the &quot;Day of Infamy&quot; using maps, photos, unique illustrations, and an animated CD. From the early stages of Japanese planning, through the attack on [[Battleship Row]], to the salvage of the U.S. Pacific fleet, this book provides a detailed overview of the attack.

*''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' by [[Gordon W. Prange]] is an extremely comprehensive account of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack and is considered by most scholars to be the best single work about the raid. It is a balanced account that gives both the Japanese and American perspectives. Prange spent 37 years researching the book by studying documents about Pearl Harbor and interviewing surviving participants to attempt the most exhaustive account of what happened: the Japanese planning and execution, why US intelligence failed to warn of it, and why a peace agreement was not attained. The book is the first in the so-called &quot;Prange Trilogy&quot; of Pearl Harbor books co-written with Donald Goldstein and Katherine Dillon, the other two being:
** ''Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History'' – a dissection of the various [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] theories surrounding the attack.
** ''December 7, 1941: The Day The Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor'' – a recollection of the attack as narrated by eyewitnesses.

*''Day of Infamy'' by [[Walter Lord]] was one of the most popular nonfiction accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lord, ''Day of Infamy'' (Henry Holt and Co., 1957. ASIN: B002A503FA; Holt Paperbacks, 60th ed. 2001, ISBN 0-8050-6803-1, ISBN 978-0-8050-6803-0)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgment'' by [[Henry C. Clausen]] and Bruce Lee tells of Clausen's top-secret investigation of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack. Much of the information in this book was still classified when previous books were published.

*''Pearl Harbor Countdown: Admiral James O. Richardson'' by Skipper Steely is an insightful and detailed account of the events leading up to the attack. Through his comprehensive treatment of the life and times of Admiral [[James O. Richardson]], Steely explores four decades of American foreign policy, traditional military practice, U.S. intelligence, and the administrative side of the military, exposing the largely untold story of the events leading up to the Japanese attack.

*''Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans'', released by Goldstein and Dillon in 1993, used materials from Prange's library to further flesh out the Japanese perspective of the attack, including diaries from some officers and ship logs.

===Alternate history===
*[[Days of Infamy series|''Days of Infamy'']] is a novel by [[Harry Turtledove]] in which the Japanese attack on Hawaii is not limited to a strike on Pearl Harbor, but is instead a full-scale invasion and eventual occupation after U.S. forces are driven off the islands (something one of the key planners of the attack, Commander [[Minoru Genda]], wanted but the senior officers realized was impossible).&lt;ref&gt;John J. Stephan, ''Hawaii Under the Rising Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; The many viewpoint characters (a Turtledove trademark) are drawn from Hawaiian civilians (both white and Japanese) as well as soldiers and sailors from both Japan and the USA. Turtledove has to date written one sequel, ''The End of the Beginning''.
* The airstrike and Hawaii-invasion premise of ''Days of Infamy'' was earlier used in the first episode of the anime OVA series ''[[Konpeki no Kantai]]''. In the episode, Japan carries out the attack in the early hours of the morning, having perfected night carrier operations. The raid begins with a [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]] drop by pathfinders. The entire base (including the repair facilities) and a number of supply ships in the harbor are destroyed by daybreak. As for the main body of the Pacific Fleet, the Combined Fleet regroups and annihilates them while they return to Pearl Harbor. The episode, which is divided into three stages in the series' game version, ends with Japanese troops landing at all islands in Hawaii.
