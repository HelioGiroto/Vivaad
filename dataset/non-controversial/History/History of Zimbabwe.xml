At the end of the [[Zimbabwe Liberation War]] there was a transition to [[majority rule]] in 1980. The [[United Kingdom]] ceremonially granted [[Zimbabwe]] independence on April 18, 1980 in accordance with the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including mismanagement and corruption, the imposition of sanctions, such as among others the [[Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001]], following the switch from Willing Buyer, Willing Seller to Fast Track land reform. Economic instability led several members of [[Military of Zimbabwe|the military]] to try to overthrow the government in a [[2007 Zimbabwean coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] in 2007. Prior to independence as Zimbabwe, the nation had been known by several names: [[Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], and [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]].

== Pre-Colonial era (1000–1887) ==

{{main|Pre-colonial history of Zimbabwe}} {{See also|Bantu expansion}}

Perhaps the first Bantu speakers to arrive in present day Zimbabwe were the makers of early Iron Age pottery belonging to the Silver Leaves or Matola tradition, third to fifth centuries A.D.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huffman|first=T.N.|title=Handbook to the Iron Age|year=2007|publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal Press|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  found in southeast Zimbabwe. This tradition was part of the eastern stream &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|title=An Archaeological Reconsideration of Bantu Expansion|journal=Muntu|year=1985|volume=2|pages=69–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Bantu expansion (sometimes called Kwale)&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Huffman|title=Handbook to the Iron Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which originated west of the Great Lakes, spreading to the coastal regions of southeastern Kenya and north eastern Tanzania, and then southwards to Mozambique, south eastern Zimbabwe  and Natal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|title=African Archaeology 3rd ed.|year=2995|publisher=Cambridge|pages=pp250 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; More substantial in numbers in Zimbabwe were the makers of the Ziwa and Gokomere ceramic wares, of the fourth century A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffman&quot;/&gt;  Their early Iron Age ceramic tradition belonged to the highlands  facies of the eastern stream,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|title=An Archaeological Reconsideration of Bantu Expansion|pages=77–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which  moved inland to Malawi and Zimbabwe. Imports of beads have been found at Gokomere and Ziwa sites, possibly in return for gold exported to the coast. 

A later phase of the Gokomere culture was the Zhizo in southern Zimbabwe. Zhizo communities settled in the Shashe-Limpopo area in the tenth century. Their capital there was Schroda (just across the Limpopo River from Zimbabwe). Many fragments of ceramic figurines have been recovered from there, figures of animals and birds, and also fertility dolls. The inhabitants produced ivory bracelets and other ivory goods. Imported beads found there and at other Zhizo sites, are evidence of trade,  probably of ivory and skins, with traders on the Indian Ocean coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=P. Mitchell and G. Whitelaw|title=The Archaeology of Southernmost Africa from c. 2000 bp to the Early 1800s: a Review of Recent Research|journal=Journal of African History|year=2005|volume=46|pages=209–241.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|title= Bantu-Speaking People in Southern Africa’ in Obenga (ed),  Les Peuples Bantu|year=1989|publisher=Paris|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mapungubwe: A Living Legacy|year=2011|publisher=Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Pottery belonging to a western stream of Bantu expansion (sometimes called Kalundu) has been found at sites in northeastern Zimbabwe, dated from the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillipson|title=Bantu-Speaking People in Southern Africa|year=1989|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The western stream originated in  the same area as the eastern stream: both belong to the same style system, called by Phillipson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=1985|title=An Archaeological Reconsideration of Bantu Expansion|pages=69–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Chifumbadze system, which has general acceptance by archaeologists.)
The terms eastern and western streams represent the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples in terms of their culture.  Another question is  the branches of the Bantu languages which they spoke.  It seems that the makers of the Ziwa/Gokomere wares were not the ancestral speakers of the Shona languages of today’s Zimbabwe, who did not arrive in there until around the tenth century, from south of the Limpopo river, and whose ceramic culture belonged to the western stream. The  linguist and historian Ehret believes that in view of the similarity of the Ziwa/Gokomere pottery to the Nkope of the ancestral Nyasa language speakers, the Ziwa/Gokomere people spoke a language closely related to the Nyasa group. Their language, whatever it was, was superseded by the ancestral Shona languages, although Ehret says that a set of Nyasa words occur in cemtral Shona dialects today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehret|first=C.|title=An African Classical Age|year=2001|publisher=University Press of Virginia|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The evidence that the ancestral Shona speakers came from South Africa is that the ceramic styles associated with Shona speakers in Zimbabwe  from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries can be traced back to western stream (Kalunndu) pottery styles  in South Africa.  The Ziwa/Gokomere and Zhizo traditions were superseded by Leopards Kopje and Gumanye wares of the Kalundu tradition from the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huffman|title=Handbook to the Iron Age|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the  western stream Kalundu tradition was ancestral to Shona ceramic wares, the closest relationships of the ancestral Shona language according to many linguists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehret|title=An African Classical Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin Y, Coupez A, Mann M|title=Continuity and divergence in the Bantu languages: perspectives from a lexicostatistic study|journal=Annales, Sciences humaines|year=1999|volume=162|pages=315–317 (the S languages)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=M.|title=Comparative Bantu: an introduction to the comparative linguistics and prehistory of the Bantu languages|year=1967-71|publisher=Gregg International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K. Rexová, Y. Bastin and D. Frynta|title=Cladistic analysis of Bantu Languages|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holden|first=C.J.|title=Bantu language trees reflect the spread of farming across sub- Saharan Africa,|journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond|year=2002|pages=793–799}}&lt;/ref&gt;   were with a southern division of eastern Bantu – such languages as the southeastern languages (Nguni, Sotho-Tswana, Tsonga), Nyasa and Makwa.  While it may well be the case that the people of the western stream spoke a language belonging to a wider  Eastern Bantu division, it is a puzzle which remains to be resolved  that they spoke a language most closely related to the languages just mentioned, all of which are today spoken in southeastern Africa.

After the Shona speaking people moved in to the present day Zimbabwe many different dialects developed over time in the different parts of the country. Among these was Kalanga.

It is believed that Kalanga speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands.  The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Kalanga states.  The [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal. They traded in [[gold]], [[ivory]] and [[copper]] for [[cloth]] and [[glass]]. From about 1250 until 1450, Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]].  This Kalanaga state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. From circa 1450–1760, Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]].  This Kalanga state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today, and parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as ''Mwenehiwas hi for its gold trade routes with [[Arabs]] and the Portuguese. However, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers destroyed the trade and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Archaeology |last=Hall |first=Martin |authorlink= |coauthors=Stephen W. Silliman |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location= |isbn=978-1-4051-0751-8 |page= |pages=241–244 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a direct response to Portuguese aggression in the interior, a new Kalanga state emerged called the [[Rozwi Empire]]. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (which means &quot;destroyers&quot;) removed the Portuguese from the Zimbabwe plateau by force of arms. The Rozwi continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding guns to its arsenal and developing a professional army to protect its trade routes and conquests.
In 1834, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele people]] arrived while fleeing from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] leader [[Shaka]], making the area their new empire, [[Matabeleland]]. In 1837–38, the Rozwi Empire along with other Shona states were conquered by the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], who arrived from south of the Limpopo and forced them to pay tribute and concentrate in northern Zimbabwe.

== Colonial era (1888–1965) ==

{{Main|Southern Rhodesia|Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland}}

In the 1880s, the British arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]]. In 1898, the name [[Southern Rhodesia]] was adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquered&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrek.org/odyssey/africa/062699/062699monicabula.html|title=So Who Was Shaka Zulu- Really?|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, British [[colonialist]] Cecil Rhodes obtained a concession for [[Rudd Concession|mining rights]] from [[King Lobengula]] of the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;mining&quot;&gt;Hensman, Howard. ''Cecil Rhodes: A Study of a Career''. p. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecil Rhodes presented this concession to persuade the government of the [[United Kingdom]] to grant a [[royal charter]] to his [[British South Africa Company (BSAC)]] over [[Matabeleland]], and its subject states such as [[Mashonaland]]. Rhodes sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]], then known as 'Zambesia'. In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties,&lt;ref name=&quot;treaties&quot;&gt;Parsons, Neil. ''A New History of Southern Africa, Second Edition'', 1993. London: Macmillan. pp. 178–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecil Rhodes promoted the colonisation of the region's land, with British control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsac&quot;&gt;Bryce, James. ''Impressions of South Africa''. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 the BSAC adopted the name '[[The Rhodesias#Origin of the name 'Rhodesia'|Rhodesia']] for the territory of Zambesia, in honour of Cecil Rhodes. In 1898 '[[Southern Rhodesia]]' became the official denotation for the region south of the Zambezi,&lt;ref name=&quot;adopted&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N1/V3N1.htm |publisher=Gray, J. A. (1956)|title=&quot;A Country in Search of a Name.&quot; ''The Northern Rhodesia Journal'' '''III''' (1) (1956). p. 78.|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became Zimbabwe. The region to the north was administered separately by the BSAC and later named [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]).

The Shona staged unsuccessful revolts (known as [[Chimurenga]]) against encroachment upon their lands, by clients of BSAC and Cecil Rhodes in 1896 and 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolts&quot;&gt;Palamarek, Ernie. ''Hatari''. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failed insurrections of 1896–97 the Ndebele and Shona groups became subject to Rhodes's administration thus precipitating [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement en masse which led to land distribution disproportionately favouring Europeans, displacing the Shona, Ndebele, and other [[indigenous peoples]].

Southern Rhodesia became a [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[British Empire|British colony]] in October 1923, subsequent to a 1922 referendum. [[Rhodesian]]s served on behalf of the United Kingdom during [[World War II]], mainly in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces in [[Italian East Africa]].

In 1953, in the face of African opposition,&lt;ref name=&quot;fed&quot;&gt;Parsons (1993). p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain consolidated the two colonies of Rhodesia with [[Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]) in the ill-fated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] which was dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing [[African nationalism]] and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three colonies. As colonial rule was ending throughout the continent and as African-majority governments assumed control in neighbouring [[Northern Rhodesia]] and in [[Nyasaland]], the white-minority Rhodesia government led by [[Ian Smith]] made a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI)]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965, effectively repudiating the British plan that the country should become a multi-racial democracy. The United Kingdom deemed this an act of rebellion, but did not re-establish control by force. The white-minority government declared itself a &quot;[[republic]]&quot; in 1970. A [[civil war]] ensued, with [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[ZAPU]] and [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[ZANU]] using assistance from the governments of [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]. Although Smith's declaration was not recognised by the United Kingdom nor any other significant power, Southern Rhodesia dropped the designation 'Southern', and claimed nation status as the [[Rhodesia|Republic of Rhodesia]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;declaration&quot;&gt;Judd, Denis. ''Empire: The British Imperial Experience from 1765 to the Present''. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;desig&quot;&gt;Parsons (1993). pp. 318–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence and the 1980s==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Robert Mugabe and Zimbabwe President Canaan Banana.jpg|thumb|President [[Canaan Banana]] (right) and Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]] attend the ceremony for the independence of Zimbabwe on April 11, 1980]] --&gt;
[[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] regained its independence as [[Zimbabwe]] on April 18, 1980. The government held independence celebrations in Rufaro stadium in [[Harare|Salisbury]], the capital. Lord [[Christopher Soames]], the last [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia]], watched as [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], gave a farewell salute and the Rhodesian Signal Corps played [[God Save the Queen]], the [[anthem]] of [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Many foreign dignitaries also attended, including [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] of [[India]], [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Shehu Shagari]] of [[Nigeria]], [[President of Zambia|President]] [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]], [[President of Botswana|President]] [[Seretse Khama]] of [[Botswana]], and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]] of [[Australia]], representing the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. [[Bob Marley]] sang 'Zimbabwe', a song he wrote, at the government's invitation in a concert at the country's independence festivities.&lt;ref name=g&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Lizzie|year=2005|title=Africa Overland|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite book|last=Pakenham|first=Thomas|year=1992|title=Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Shagari pledged $15 million at the celebration to train Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and [[expatriates]] in Nigeria. Mugabe's government used part of the money to buy newspaper companies owned by South Africans, increasing the government's control over the media. The rest went to training students in Nigerian universities, government workers in the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria in [[Badagry]], and soldiers in the Nigerian Defence Academy in [[Kaduna]]. Later that year Mugabe commissioned a report by the BBC on [[press freedom]] in Zimbabwe. The BBC issued its report on June 26, recommending the privatisation of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and its independence from political interests.&lt;ref name=i&gt;{{cite book|last=Abegunrin|first=Olayiwola|year=2003|title=Nigerian Foreign Policy Under Military Rule, 1966–1999|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline Audrey|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|page=711}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also:'' [[Foreign relations of Zimbabwe]]

Mugabe's government changed the capital's name from Salisbury to [[Harare]] on April 18, 1982 in celebration of the second anniversary of independence.&lt;ref name=k&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline Audrey|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|page=718}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government renamed the main street in the capital, Jameson Avenue, in honor of [[Samora Machel]], [[President of Mozambique]].

The new Constitution provided for a non-executive President as Head of State with a Prime Minister as Head of Government. Reverend [[Canaan Banana]] served as the first President. In government amended the Constitution in 1987 to provide for an Executive President and abolished the office of Prime Minister. The constitutional changes came into effect on 1 January 1988 with Robert Mugabe as President. The [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Zimbabwe|Parliament]] had a directly-elected House of Assembly and an indirectly-elected Senate, partly made up of tribal chiefs. The Constitution established two separate voters rolls, one for the black majority, who had 80% of the seats in Parliament, and the other for whites and other ethnic minorities, such as [[Coloured]]s, people of mixed race, and Asians, who held 20%. The government amended the Constitution in 1986, eliminating the voter rolls and replacing the white seats with seats filled by nominated members. Many white MPs joined ZANU which then reappointed them. In 1990 the government abolished the Senate and increased the House of Assembly's membership to include members nominated by the President.

Prime Minister [[Mugabe]] kept [[Peter Walls]], the head of the army, in his government and put him in charge of integrating the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), and the [[Rhodesian Army]]. While [[Western world|Western]] media outlets praised Mugabe's efforts at reconciliation with the [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white minority]], tension soon developed.&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,921868,00.html Walls: &quot;We will make it work&quot;] TIME magazine and CNN&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 1980, after several unsuccessful assassination attempts Mugabe asked Walls, &quot;Why are your men trying to kill me?&quot; Walls replied, &quot;If they were my men you would be dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=c&gt;Raymond, Walter John. ''Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms'', 1992. Page 557.&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC news]] interviewed Walls on August 11, 1980. He told the BBC that he had asked [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] to annul the 1980 presidential election prior to the official announcement of the result on the grounds that Mugabe used intimidation to win the election. Walls said Thatcher had not replied to his request. On August 12 British government officials denied that they had not responded, saying [[Antony Duff]], Deputy Governor of [[Harare|Salisbury]], told Walls on March 3 that Thatcher would not annul the election.&lt;ref name=d&gt;Kalley, Jacqueline Audrey. ''Southern African Political History: A chronological of key political events from independence to mid-1997'', 1999. Page 711-712.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister of Information [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] said the government would not be &quot;held ransom by racial misfits&quot; and told &quot;all those Europeans who do not accept the new order to pack their bags.&quot; He also said the government continued to consider taking &quot;legal or administrative action&quot; against Walls. Mugabe, returning from a visit with [[United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[New York City]], said, &quot;One thing is quite clear—we are not going to have disloyal characters in our society.&quot; Walls returned to Zimbabwe after the interview, telling Peter Hawthorne of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, &quot;To stay away at this time would have appeared like an admission of guilt.&quot; Mugabe drafted legislation that would exile Walls from Zimbabwe for life and Walls moved to South Africa.&lt;ref name=e&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2000/12/21/foreign/DBACKFIR.HTM Zanu-PF's Walls 'manhunt' backfires] Dispatch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,922125,00.html A soldier faces his critics] TIME magazine and CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic divisions soon came back to the forefront of national politics. Tension between ZAPU and ZANU erupted with guerrilla activity starting again in [[Matabeleland]] in south-western Zimbabwe. Nkomo (ZAPU) left for exile in Britain and did not return until Mugabe guaranteed his safety. In 1982 government security officials discovered large caches of arms and ammunition on properties owned by ZAPU, accusing Nkomo and his followers of plotting to overthrow the government. Mugabe fired Nkomo and his closest aides from the cabinet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Seven MPs, members of the Rhodesian Front, left Smith's party to sit as &quot;independents&quot; on March 4, 1982, signifying their dissatisfaction with his policies.&lt;ref name=k/&gt; As a result of what they saw as persecution of Nkomo and his party, PF-ZAPU supporters, army deserters began a campaign of dissidence against the government. Centering primarily in Matabeleland, home of the Ndebeles who were at the time PF-ZAPU's main followers, this dissidence continued through 1987. It involved attacks on government personnel and installations, armed banditry aimed at disrupting security and economic life in the rural areas, and harassment of ZANU-PF members.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ad28|title=HISTORY OF ZIMBABWE|work=History World|date=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the unsettled security situation immediately after independence and the continuing anti government dissidence, the government kept in force a &quot;state of emergency&quot;. This gave the government widespread powers under the &quot;Law and Order Maintenance Act,&quot; including the right to detain persons without charge which it used quite widely. In 1983 to 1984 the government declared a curfew in areas of Matabeleland and sent in the army in an attempt to suppress dissidents. Credible reports surfaced of widespread violence and disregard for human rights by the security forces during these operations, and the level of political tension rose in the country as a result. The pacification campaign, known as the Gukuruhundi, or strong wind, resulted in at least 20,000 civilian deaths perpetrated by an elite, communist-trained brigade, known in Zimbabwe as the [[Gukurahundi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The situation evolved into a low level civil war.

ZANU-PF increased its majority in the 1985 elections, winning 67 of the 100 seats. The majority gave Mugabe the opportunity to start making changes to the constitution, including those with regard to land restoration. Fighting did not cease until Mugabe and Nkomo reached an agreement in December 1987 whereby ZAPU became part of ZANU-PF and the government changed the constitution to make Mugabe the country's first executive president and Nkomo one of two vice presidents.

==1990s==
Elections in March 1990 resulted in another overwhelming victory for Mugabe and his party, which won 117 of the 120 election seats. Election observers estimated [[voter turnout]] at only 54% and found the campaign neither free nor fair{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, though balloting met international standards. Unsatisfied with a ''[[de facto]]'' [[one-party state]], Mugabe called on the ZANU-PF Central Committee to support the creation of a ''[[de jure]]'' one-party state in September 1990 and lost. The government began further amending the constitution. The judiciary and human rights advocates fiercely criticised the first amendments enacted in April 1991 because they restored corporal and [[capital punishment]] and denied recourse to the courts in cases of compulsory purchase of land by the government. The general health of the civilian population also began to significantly flounder and by 1997 25% of the population of Zimbabwe had been infected by [[HIV]], the [[AIDS virus]].&lt;ref name=k&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0862066.html|title=History of Zimbabwe|work=[[Infoplease]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s students, trade unionists, and workers often demonstrated to express their discontent with the government. Students protested in 1990 against proposals for an increase in government control of universities and again in 1991 and 1992 when they clashed with police. Trade unionists and workers also criticised the government during this time. In 1992 police prevented trade unionists from holding anti-government demonstrations. In 1994 widespread industrial unrest weakened the economy. In 1996 civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite news|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/zimbabwe/p/ZimbabweHist3.htm|title= A Brief History of Zimbabwe|work=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 1997 a national strike paralyzed the country. Mugabe was panicked by demonstrations by [[Zanla]] ex-combatants, war veterans, who had been the heart of incursions 20 years earlier in the Bush War. He agreed to pay them large gratuities and pensions, which proved to be a wholly unproductive and unbudgeted financial commitment. The discontent with the government spawned draconian government crackdowns which in turn started to destroy both the fabric of the state and of society. This in turn brought with it further discontent within the population. Thus a vicious downward spiral commenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polsci&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ips.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/91|title=From Corporatism to Liberalization in Zimbabwe: Economic Policy Regimes and Political Crisis, 1980–97|work=[[International Political Science Review]]|date= Vol. 26, No. 1, 91-106 (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many whites had left Zimbabwe after independence, mainly for neighboring [[South Africa]], those who remained continued to wield disproportionate control of some sectors of the economy, especially agriculture. In the late-1990s whites accounted for less than 1% of the population but owned 70% of [[arable land]]. Mugabe raised this issue of land ownership by white farmers. In a calculated move, he began forcible land redistribution, which brought the government into headlong conflict with the International Monetary Fund. Amid a severe drought in the region, the police and military were instructed not to stop the invasion of white-owned farms by the so-called 'war veterans' and youth militia. This has led to a mass migration of White Zimbabweans out of Zimbabwe. At present almost no arable land is in the possession of white farmers; the country has also experienced a debilitating food shortage with the exodus of its White minority, turning the &quot;breadbasket of Africa&quot; into one of Africa's most food insecure states.

===The economy during the 1980s and 1990s===
{{Main|Economic history of Zimbabwe}}
The economy was run along [[corporatist]] lines with strict governmental controls on all aspects of the economy. Controls were placed on wages, prices and massive increases in government spending resulting in significant [[budget deficits]]. This experiment met with very mixed results and Zimbabwe fell further behind the first world and unemployment.
Some market reforms in the 1990s were attempted. A 40 per cent [[devaluation]] of the [[Zimbabwean dollar]] was allowed to occur and price and wage controls were removed. These policies also failed at that time. Growth, employment, wages, and social service spending contracted sharply, inflation did not improve, the deficit remained well above target, and many industrial firms, notably in textiles and footwear, closed in response to increased competition and high real interest rates. The incidence of poverty in the country increased during this time.

==1999 to 2000==
{{See also|Land reform in Zimbabwe}}
However, Zimbabwe began experiencing a period of considerable political and economic upheaval in 1999. Opposition to President Mugabe and the ZANU-PF government grew considerably after the mid-1990s in part due to worsening economic and human rights conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimonline1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=633|title=REPORT: Policing the State - an evaluation of 1,981 political arrests in Zimbabwe: 2000–2005|work=[[ZimOnline]]|date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) was established in September 1999 as an opposition party founded by trade unionist [[Morgan Tsvangirai]].

The MDC's first opportunity to test opposition to the Mugabe government came in February 2000, when a referendum was held on a draft constitution proposed by the government. Among its elements, the new constitution would have permitted President Mugabe to seek two additional terms in office, granted government officials immunity from prosecution, and authorised government seizure of white-owned land. The referendum was handily defeated. Shortly thereafter, the government, through a loosely organised group of war veterans, sanctioned an aggressive land redistribution program often characterised by forced expulsion of white farmers and violence against both farmers and farm employees{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.

[[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2000|Parliamentary elections held in June 2000]] were marred by localised violence, and claims of electoral irregularities and government intimidation of opposition supporters{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Nonetheless, the MDC succeeded in capturing 57 of 120 seats in the National Assembly.

==2002==
Presidential elections were held in March 2002. In the months leading up to the poll, ZANU-PF, with the support of the army{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, security services{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, and especially the so-called 'war veterans'{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}},  – very few of whom actually fought in the [[Second Chimurenga]] against the Smith regime in the 1970s {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} – set about wholesale intimidation and suppression of the MDC-led opposition{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Despite strong international criticism{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, these measures, together with organised subversion of the electoral process, ensured a Mugabe victory{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} . The government's behavior drew strong criticism from the EU and the USA, which imposed limited sanctions against the leading members of the Mugabe regime. Since the 2002 election, Zimbabwe has suffered further economic difficulty and growing political chaos.

==2003–2005==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
[[Image:Zimbabwe £8 in local currency in 2003.jpg|thumb|[[GBP]] 8 worth of [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s in 2003]]
Divisions within the opposition MDC had begun to fester early in the decade, after Morgan Tsvangirai (the president of the MDC) was lured  {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} into a government sting operation that videotaped him talking of Mr. Mugabe's removal from power. He was subsequently arrested and put on trial on treason charges. This crippled his control of party affairs and raised questions about his competence. It also catalyzed a major split within the party. In 2004 he was acquitted, but not until after suffering serious abuse and mistreatment in prison. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The opposing faction was led by [[Welshman Ncube]] who was the general secretary of the party. In mid-2004, vigilantes loyal to Mr. Tsvangirai began attacking members who were mostly loyal to Ncube, climaxing in a September raid on the party's Harare headquarters in which the security director was nearly thrown to his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/world/africa/09zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Opposition Splits While Zimbabwe Slips|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 9, 2007 | first=Michael | last=Wines | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal party inquiry later established that aides to Tsvangirai had tolerated, if not endorsed, the violence. Divisive as the violence was, it was a debate over the rule of law that set off the party's final breakup in November 2005. These division severely weakened the opposition. In addition the government employed its own operatives to both spy on each side and to undermine each side via acts of espionage. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2005]] were held in March 2005 in which ZANU-PF won a two-thirds majority, were again criticised by international observers as being flawed. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Mugabe's political operatives were thus able to weaken the opposition internally and the security apparatus of the state was able to destabilize it externally by using violence in anti-Mugabe strongholds to prevent citizens from voting. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Some voters were 'turned away' from polling station despite having proper identification{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, further guaranteeing that the government could control the results. Additionally Mugabe had started to appoint judges sympathetic to the government{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, making any judicial appeal futile. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Mugabe was also able to appoint 30 of the Members of Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1450239,00.html|title=Mugabe's party wins Zimbabwe election|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 1, 2005 | location=London | first=James | last=Sturcke | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Senate elections approached further opposition splits occurred. Ncube's supporters argued that the M.D.C. should field a slate of candidates; Tsvangirai's argued for a boycott. When party leaders voted on the issue, Ncube's side narrowly won, but Mr. Tsvangirai declared that as president of the party he was not bound by the majority's decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/world/africa/09zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Opposition Splits While Zimbabwe Slips|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= May 9, 2007 | first=Michael | last=Wines | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again the opposition was weakened. As a result the elections for a new Senate in November 2005 were largely boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe's party won 24 of the 31 constituencies where elections were held amid low voter turnout. Again, evidence surfaced of voter intimidation and fraud. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In May 2005 the government began [[Operation Murambatsvina]]. It was officially billed to rid urban areas of illegal structures, illegal business enterprises, and criminal activities. In practice its purpose was to punish political opponents{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. The UN estimates 700,000 people have been left without jobs or homes as a result.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Families and traders, especially at the beginning of the operation, were often given no notice before police destroyed their homes and businesses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Others were able to salvage some possessions and building materials but often had nowhere to go, despite the government's statement that people should be returning to their rural homes. Thousands of families were left unprotected in the open in the middle of Zimbabwe's winter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, . The government interfered with non-governmental organisation (NGO) efforts to provide emergency assistance to the displaced in many instances.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Some families were removed to transit camps, where they had no shelter or cooking facilities and minimal food, supplies, and sanitary facilities. The operation continued into July 2005, when the government began a program to provide housing for the newly displaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;us-state&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5479.htm|title=Background Note: Zimbabwe|work=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch said the evictions had disrupted treatment for people with [[HIV]]/[[Aids]] in a country where 3,000 die from the disease each week and about 1.3 million children have been orphaned. The operation was &quot;the latest manifestation of a massive human rights problem that has been going on for years&quot;, said Amnesty International. As of September 2006, housing construction fell far short of demand, and there were reports that beneficiaries were mostly civil servants and ruling party loyalists, not those displaced. The government campaign of forced evictions continued in 2006, albeit on a lesser scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;us-state&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1636534,00.html|title=Zimbabwe surrounded by sound and fury, but little action|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2005-11-08 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Tisdall | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 Mugabe signed constitutional amendments that reinstituted a national senate (abolished in 1987) and that nationalised all land. This converted all ownership rights into leases. The amendments also ended the right of landowners to challenge government expropriation of land in the courts and marked the end of any hope of returning any land that had been hitherto grabbed by armed land invasions. Elections for the senate in November resulted in a victory for the government. The MDC split over whether to field candidates and partially boycotted the vote. In addition to low turnout there was widespread government intimidation. The split in the MDC hardened into factions, each of which claimed control of the party. The early months of 2006 were marked by food shortages and mass hunger. The sheer extremity of the siltation was revealed by the fact that in the courts, state witnesses said they were too weak from hunger to testify.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1580389,00.html|title=Zimbabwe's economic crisis drives it back into steam age|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2005-09-29 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Meldrum | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 to 2007==
In August 2006 runaway inflation forced the government to replace its existing currency with a revalued one. In December 2006, ZANU-PF proposed the &quot;harmonisation&quot; of the parliamentary and presidential election schedules in 2010; the move was seen by the opposition as an excuse to extend Mugabe's term as president until 2010.

[[Morgan Tsvangirai]] was badly beaten on March 12, 2007 after being arrested and held at Machipisa Police Station in the Highfield suburb of Harare. The event garnered an international outcry and was considered particularly brutal and extreme, even considering the reputation of Mugabe's government. &quot;We are very concerned by reports of continuing brutal attacks on opposition activists in Zimbabwe and call on the government to stop all acts of violence and intimidation against opposition activists,&quot; said Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of [[Amnesty International]]'s Africa Programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGAFR460072007/$FILE/newsrelease.pdf|title=Zimbabwe: End harassment, torture and intimidation of opposition activists|work=[[Amnesty International]]|date=2007-03-28|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy has shrunk by 50% from 2000 to 2007.

The country used to be one of Africa's richest and is now one of its poorest. Many observers now view the country as a '[[failed state]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;allafrica1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200705071560.html |title=Zimbabwe: Column - Mary Revesai|work= All Africa|date=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;costa&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/business/ci_5678248|title=Trip to Africa enlightens|work=[[Contra Costa Times]]|date=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of the [[Second Congo War]] brought back Zimbabwe's substantial military commitment, although some troops remain to secure the mining assets under their control. The government lacks the resources or machinery to deal with the ravages of the [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] [[pandemic]], which affects 25% of the population. With all this and the forced and violent removal of white farmers in a brutal land redistribution program, Mugabe has earned himself widespread scorn from the international arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/zimbabwe/article/0,,2062805,00.html|title=Now Zimbabwe can see end of the road for its 'brutal old man'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= 2007-04-22 | location=London | first=Tracy | last=McVeigh | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime has managed to cling to power by creating wealthy enclaves for government ministers, and senior party members. For example Borrowdale Brook, a suburb of Harare is an oasis of wealth and privilege. It features mansions, manicured lawns, full shops with fully stocked shelves containing an abundance of fruit and vegetables, big cars and a golf club give is the home to President Mugabe's out-of-town retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3231229.ece|title=President leaves behind a people left paralysed by their poverty|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-12-07 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Evans | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe's bakeries shut down in October 2007 and supermarkets warned that they would have no bread for the foreseeable future due to collapse in wheat production after the seizure of white-owned farms. The ministry of agriculture has also blamed power shortages for the wheat shortfall, saying that electricity cuts have affected irrigation and halved crop yields per acre. The power shortages are because Zimbabwe relies on Mozambique for some of its electricity and that due to an unpaid bill of $35 million Mozambique had reduced the amount of electrical power it supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian7&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2181488,00.html

On December 8, 2007, Mugabe attended a meeting of EU and African leaders in Lisbon, prompting UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown to decline to attend.

===Deterioration of the educational system===
The educational system in Zimbabwe which was once regarded as among the best in Africa, has gone into crisis because of the country's economic meltdown. Almost a quarter of the teachers have quit the country, absenteeism is high, buildings are crumbling and standards plummeting. One foreign reporter witnessed hundreds of children at Hatcliffe Extension Primary School in Epworth, 12 miles west of Harare, writing in the dust on the floor because they had no exercise books or pencils. The high school exam system unraveled in 2007. Examiners refused to mark examination papers when they were offered just Z$79 a paper, enough to buy three small candies. Corruption has crept into the system and may explain why in January 2007 thousands of pupils received no marks for subjects they had entered, while others were deemed &quot;excellent&quot; in subjects they had not sat. Various disused offices and storerooms have been turned into makeshift brothels at the [[University of Zimbabwe]] in Harare by students and staff who have turned to prostitution to make ends meet. Students are destitute following the institution's refusal in July to re-open their halls of residence, effectively banning students from staying on campus. Student leaders believe this was part of the administration's plan to take revenge on them for their demonstrations over deteriorating standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=K0APPBWKUSZGDQFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2007/11/18/wzim118.xml|title= Thousands of teachers abandon Zimbabwe |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 2007-11-18 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allaf1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200712031175.html|title= Zimbabwe: Education - 30 Years Backwards And Still Declining|work=[[All Africa]]|date= 2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 elections===
{{Main|Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008–2009 Zimbabwean political negotiations}}
[[Zimbabwe]] held a presidential election along with a [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|parliamentary election]] on March 29, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lead&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/30/africa/AF-POL-Zimbabwe-Elections.php &quot;Zimbabwe's opposition party claims early election lead&quot;], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), March 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The three major candidates were [[incumbent]] [[List of Presidents of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF), [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai]] (MDC-T), and [[Simba Makoni]], an independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confirmed&quot;&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i9aiJMhhB-k2LjLRhKWcRdcwyptg &quot;Zimbabwe presidential candidates confirmed&quot;], AFP, February 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As no candidate received an outright majority in the first round, a second round was held on June 27, 2008 between Tsvangirai (with 47.9% of the first round vote) and Mugabe (43.2%). Tsvangirai withdrew from the second round a week before it was scheduled to take place, citing violence against his party's supporters. The second round went ahead, despite widespread criticism, and led to victory for Mugabe.

Because of Zimbabwe's [[Economy of Zimbabwe|dire economic situation]] the election was expected to provide President Mugabe with his toughest electoral challenge to date. Mugabe's opponents were critical of the handling of the electoral process, and the government was accused of planning to rig the election; [[Human Rights Watch]] said that the election was likely to be &quot;deeply flawed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn23mar08&quot;&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/03/23/zimbabwe.elections/index.html &quot;Mugabe accused of election-rigging plan&quot;], CNN, March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the first round, but before the counting was completed, Jose Marcos Barrica, the head of the [[Southern African Development Community]] observer mission, described the election as &quot;a peaceful and credible expression of the will of the people of Zimbabwe.&quot;

Preliminary talks to set up conditions for [[2008 Zimbabwean political negotiations|official negotiations]] began between leading negotiators from both parties on July 10, and on July 22, the three party leaders met for the first time in [[Harare]] to express their support for a negotiated settlement of disputes arising out of the presidential and parliamentary elections.

The talks were mediated by [[South Africa]]n [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]].
