{{Communism sidebar}}
A '''communist revolution''' is a [[proletarian revolution]] often, but necessarily inspired by the ideas of [[Marxism]] that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[communism]], typically with [[socialism]] as an intermediate stage. The idea that a proletarian revolution is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism; Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the [[working class]]. Thus, in the Marxist view, proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world; see [[world revolution]].

[[Leninism]] argues that a communist revolution must be led by a [[Vanguard party|vanguard]] of '[[professional revolutionaries]]'—that is, men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who can then form the nucleus of the revolutionary movement. Some Marxists disagree with the idea of a vanguard as put forth by Lenin, especially [[left communist]]s but also including some who continue to consider themselves [[Marxist-Leninist]]s despite such a disagreement. These critics insist that the entire working class - or at least a large part of it - must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build massive [[communist parties]] with very large memberships.

See the articles on ''[[communism]]'' and ''[[communist state]]s'' for further discussion regarding the goals and results of some of these revolutions.

==Communist revolutions throughout history==

The following is a list of communist revolutions throughout [[history]]. The most significant ones are marked in '''bold'''. Among the lesser known revolutions, a number of borderline cases have been included which may or may not have been communist revolutions. The nature of unsuccessful revolutions is particularly contentious since one can only speculate as to the kinds of policies that would have been implemented by the revolutionaries had they achieved victory.

* The creation of the short-lived '''[[Paris Commune]]''' in 1871, which was crushed within months by the [[French Army]].
* The 1917 communist revolution in [[Russia]], known as the '''[[October Revolution]]''' and a part of the '''[[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]'''. It resulted in the victory of the [[Bolshevik]]s and the creation of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], the predecessor of the [[Soviet Union]].
* The '''[[German Revolution]]''' of 1918-1919, led by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], which ended in defeat for the communists.
* The creation of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, which was defeated within a month by the German army and [[Freikorps]].
* The [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian revolution]] of 1919, led by [[Béla Kun]], which was defeated after five months.
* The [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921]] led by the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]], which defeated the [[Occupation of Mongolia|Republic of China's Mongolian Puppet state]] and the [[White Movement|White Guards]] under [[Baron Ungern]] with the help of the Russian [[Red Army]].
* The [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], known as ''La matanza'' (the slaughter), [[Pipil people|Pipil]] and peasant rebellion led by [[Farabundo Martí]].
* The '''[[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]]''', final stage of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1926–1949), that resulted in the victory of the [[Communist Party of China]] on [[mainland China]] in 1949.
* 1941-1945 [[People's Liberation War]] in [[Yugoslavia]] is waged by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] under the command of [[Josip Broz Tito]] with Allied support against the invading forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and the pro-Nazi Croatian [[Ustase]]. The victorious partisans establish the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].
*The '''[[August Revolution]]''' 1945 creating the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].
* The [[History of North Korea#1948 proclamation of the DPRK|Proclamation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] in 1948, when the Soviet-backed [[Workers Party of Korea]], led by [[Kim Il-sung]], announced the formation of the state of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].
* The '''[[Cuban Revolution]]''' of 1959 was a nationalistic revolution led by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] which overthrew former president [[Fulgencio Batista]] and instated a socialist regime later on in [[Cuba]]. Even though Batista had been elected for his first term, he got himself into power for his second term through a [[coup d'etat]].
*''[[Trois Glorieuses (1963)|Les Trois Glorieuses]]'' of 1963 in [[Congo-Brazzaville]], a successful [[coup d'état]] led by the ''[[Confédération générale aéfienne du travail]]'' and the ''[[Union de la jeunesse congolaise]]'' against [[Fulbert Youlou]] established the [[People's Republic of the Congo]].
*The [[History of Indonesia#September 30th massacre and aftermath|Indonesian revolution]] and [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] support for President [[Sukarno]], which ended when [[Indonesia]]n General [[Suharto]] removed President Sukarno from power and defeated the Communist Party of Indonesia, in 1965-1966.
* The ''[[First Indochina War#1954: Defeat of the French|First Indochina War in Vietnam]]'' that resulted in the defeat of the French at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], 1954, and brought the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] to power in [[North Vietnam]]{{spaced ndash}}a victory followed closely by the protracted [[guerrilla warfare]]-dominated ''[[Vietnam War]]'' (1957–1975), which in turn led to the '''[[Fall of Saigon]]''' and the driving-out of occupying [[United States|U.S.]] military forces there, and the unification of North and South Vietnam by communist guerrilla forces into the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. The conflict drastically changed neighboring [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].
* The [[Laotian Civil War]] resulting in the victory of the communist [[Pathet Lao]]/[[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] in [[Laos]] by 1975, eliminating a coalition government with [[anti-communists]] led to the establishment of the communist-administered [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]].
* The victory of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]] in 1975, establishing the [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] regime known as &quot;[[Democratic Kampuchea]],&quot; with [[Pol Pot]] as [[dictator]].  In 1979 it was overthrown by former allies: socialist neighbor [[Vietnam]] and another [[communist party]] faction, reconstituted as the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] and establishing the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]].
* The [[Malayan Emergency]] when the [[Malayan Communist Party]] and communist guerrillas fought against, and were defeated by, British and [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] forces, 1948-1960.
* [[Maoist]]-styled &quot;[[Protracted People's War]]&quot; in the [[Philippines]], launched by the [[New People's Army]] in 1969 and continuing at present
* The overthrow of Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] who then set up one-party Marxist-Leninist rule in [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] by the communist [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]], 1977–1991, until they were defeated and expelled by the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] during a subsequent civil war.
* The 1978 the [[Saur Revolution]] that brought the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] to power in [[Afghanistan]]. They were overthrown by the [[mujahedin]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepeoplesmovement.org/ry/rys7a.html &quot;Afghanistan’s Saur Revolution of 1978, and the U.S.-backed counterrevolution&quot;] ''Rebel Yell!'' Spring 2007. Retrieved 08-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The overthrow of [[Eric Gairy]] that brought the [[New Jewel Movement]] to power in [[Grenada]]  from 1979 until 1983, when they were deposed by a [[U.S.]]-led invasion.
* The 1979 '''[[Nicaraguan Revolution]]''' that overthrew the dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] and brought the [[Sandinistas]] to power in [[Nicaragua]] from 1979 to 1990.
* The '''[[Salvadoran Civil War]]''', (1980–1992) [[FMLN]] (mainly composed of [[Marxist-Leninist]] guerrilla groups) fought against the U.S. backed military government which suppressed the rebel movement by framing and mass murdering alleged [[Marxist-Leninist]] revolutionaries ([[El Mozote massacre]]). The FMLN was inspired by the ideologies of [[Farabundo Martí]] and [[Lenin]] and rejected Maoism and Stalinism.
*[[Internal conflict in Peru]] (1980–present) Comprised two rebellions by two different Marxist organizations. One of several groups that calls itself the [[Communist Party of Peru]], the [[Shining Path]] fought a bloody war beginning in 1980 with successive Peruvian governments, both democratic and authoritarian in nature, and independent paramilitaries organized by the government known as [[Ronda Campesina]]. The Shining Path attempted to enforce a particular brand of communism inspired by the beliefs of [[Mao Zedong]], the leader of the People's Republic of China from 1949-1976. The Shining Path opposed any form of democracy and committed numerous human rights violations. Another organization, known as the [[Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA), named after an Incan warrior [[Tupac Amaru]] began their own rebellion in 1982. The MRTA did not adhere to [[Maoism]] like the Shining Path, claimed to be fighting for democracy, believed in a more mainstream version of communism and modeled their movement on other left-wing guerrilla groups in Latin America. The MRTA and Shining Path quickly became bitter enemies and fought one another as well as the government of Peru. During the war atrocities were committed on all sides, but mostly by the Shining Path and the Peruvian military. Fighting goes on today with a small number of Shining Path cadres, however the movement has mostly been crushed and only operates in a very remote jungle region. Since the capture of Shining Path leader [[Abimael Guzman]], the organization has lost most of its earlier support. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was largely destroyed in 1997 after the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]].
*From 1996-2006, the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] fought [[Nepalese Civil War|a fairly successful revolutionary war]] against the autocratic [[King of Nepal]]. In 2006 peace was declared, and an agreement was reached that the Maoists would join an interim government.
*In [[India]], various Maoist-oriented factions (generally called [[Naxalite]]s) have waged armed struggles since the [[Naxalbari]] rebellion of 1967. Today, the most prominent Naxalite group is the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]].
