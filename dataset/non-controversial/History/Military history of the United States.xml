The '''military history of the United States''' spans a period of over two centuries. During those years, the United States evolved from a new nation fighting Great Britain for independence (1775–1783), through the monumental [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) to the world's sole remaining [[superpower]] of the late 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers, ed., ''The Oxford Guide to American Military History'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Main|Military of the United States|Military budget in the United States}}

[[File:US military personnel and expenditures.png|thumb|500px|right|U.S. military personnel and expenditures, 1790–2006. Personnel is shown in orange (left axis); expenditures are in teal (right axis). The two axes are scaled to visually align for World War II, thus showing the difference between the cost per soldier before and after President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s &quot;[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]&quot; policy of the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Newton|title=Eisenhower: The White House Years|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bbH1QYXxtMcC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2011|publisher=Random House|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Continental Congress in 1775 created the [[Continental Army]] and named General [[George Washington]] its commander. This newly formed army, along with state militia forces, and the French army and navy, defeated the British in 1781. The new Constitution in 1789 made the president the commander in chief, with authority for the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to levy taxes, and make the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''America as a Military Power: From the American Revolution to the Civil War'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the U.S. military consists of an [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] under the command of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. There also is the [[United States Coast Guard]], which is controlled by the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

The [[President of the United States]] is the [[commander in chief]], and exercises the authority through the [[Secretary of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which supervises combat operations.  In addition, each state has a [[United States National Guard|national guard]] commanded by the state's [[governor]] and coordinated by the [[National Guard Bureau]]. The President of the United States has the authority during national emergencies to assume control of individual state National Guard units.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Anderson, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===Colonial wars (1620–1774)===
{{Main|Colonial American military history}}
The beginning of the United States military lies in civilian frontier settlers, armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness. These were organized into local militias for small military operations, mostly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes but also to resist possible raids by the small military forces of neighboring European colonies. They relied on the British regular army and navy for any serious military operation.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, James Arnold, and Roberta Wiener eds. ''The Encyclopedia of North American Colonial Conflicts to 1775: A Political, Social, and Military History'' (2008) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/185109752X/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

In major operations outside the locality involved, the militia was not employed as a fighting force. Instead the colony asked for (and paid) volunteers, many of whom were also militia members.&lt;ref&gt;James Titus, ''The Old Dominion at War: Society, Politics and Warfare in Late Colonial Virginia'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:British burninng warship Prudent and capturing Bienfaisant. Siege of Louisbourg 1758. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, M55.7.1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]

In the early years of the [[British colonization of North America]], military action in the thirteen colonies that would become the United States were the result of conflicts with Native Americans, such as in the [[Pequot War]] of 1637, [[King Philip's War]] in 1675, the [[Yamasee War]] in 1715 and [[Father Rale's War]] in 1722.

Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a [[French and Indian Wars|series of wars]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and France for control of North America, the most important of which were [[Queen Anne's War]], in which the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquered]] French colony [[Acadia]], and the final [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America. This final war was to give thousands of colonists, including Virginia colonel [[George Washington]], military experience which they put to use during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of Independence (1775–1783)===
{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:Yorktown-peale.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Detail from ''Washington and his Generals at Yorktown'' (c. 1781) by [[Charles Willson Peale]]. [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] (far left) is at Washington's right, the [[Comte de Rochambeau]] to his immediate left.]]

Ongoing [[American Revolution|political tensions]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] reached a crisis in 1774 when the British placed the [[province of Massachusetts]] under martial law after the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] protested taxes they regarded as a violation of their constitutional rights as Englishmen. When shooting began at [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, militia units from across New England rushed to Boston and bottled up the British in the city. The [[Continental Congress]] appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief of the newly created [[Continental Army]], which was augmented throughout the war by colonial [[militia]]. He drove the British out of Boston but in late summer 1776 they returned to New York and nearly captured Washington's army.  Meanwhile the revolutionaries expelled British officials from the 13 states, and declared themselves an independent nation in July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Don Higginbotham, ''The war of American independence: military attitudes, policies, and practice, 1763–1789'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|[[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|Washington's surprise crossing of the Delaware River]] in December 1776 was a major comeback after the loss of New York City; his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.]]

The British, for their part, lacked both a unified command and a clear strategy for winning. With the use of the [[Royal Navy]], the British were able to capture coastal cities, but control of the countryside eluded them. A British [[Saratoga campaign|sortie from Canada]] in 1777 ended with the disastrous surrender of a British army at [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]]. With the coming in 1777 of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|General von Steuben]], the training and discipline along Prussian lines began, and the Continental Army began to evolve into a modern force. France and Spain then entered the war against Great Britain as Allies of the US, ending its naval advantage and escalating the conflict into a world war. The Netherlands later joined France, and the British were outnumbered on land and sea in a world war, as they had no major allies apart from Indian tribes.

A shift in [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|focus to the southern American states]] in 1779 resulted in a string of victories for the British, but General [[Nathanael Greene]] engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]] and prevented them from making strategic headway. The main British army was surrounded by Washington's American and French forces at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] in 1781, as the French fleet blocked a rescue by the Royal Navy. The British then sued for peace.

====George Washington====
General [[George Washington]] (1732–1799) proved an excellent organizer and administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Lesson Plan on &quot;What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?&quot; [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriots had a strong distrust of a permanent &quot;[[standing army]]&quot;, so the Continental Army was quickly demobilized, with land grants to veterans. General Washington, who throughout the war deferred to elected officials, averted [[Newburgh conspiracy|a potential coup d'état]] and resigned as commander-in-chief after the war, establishing a tradition of civil control of the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward G. Lengel|title=A Companion to George Washington|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vGmuebAjZAEC&amp;pg=PA300|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early national period (1783–1812)===
{{Main|Northwest Indian War|Quasi-War|Barbary Wars|Tecumseh's War|Creek War}}

Following the [[American Revolution]], the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western [[frontier]]. The United States was a minor military power during this time, having only a modest army and navy. A traditional distrust of standing armies, combined with faith in the abilities of local militia, precluded the development of well-trained units and a professional [[officer corps]]. [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] leaders preferred a small army and navy, fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars, and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783–1802'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Stephen Decatur]] boarding the Tripolitan gunboat, 3 August 1804, the [[First Barbary War]].]]
In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] after the Revolution, the British had ceded the lands between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] to the United States, without consulting the [[Shawnee]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]] and other smaller tribes who lived there. Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began [[Northwest Ordinance|dividing these lands]] for settlement. This provoked a [[Northwest Indian War|war]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]] in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a [[Legion of the United States|newly trained army]] to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Kessel and Robert Wooster, eds. ''Encyclopedia of Native American wars and warfare'' (2005) pp 50, 123, 186, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[revolutionary France]] declared [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1793|war on Great Britain]] in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the [[Jay Treaty]], which was favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. French [[privateer]]s began to seize U.S. vessels, which led to an undeclared &quot;[[Quasi-War]]&quot; between the two nations. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800, the United States won a string of victories in the Caribbean. George Washington was called out of retirement to head a &quot;provisional army&quot; in case of invasion by France, but President [[John Adams]] managed to negotiate a truce, in which France agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease its attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Palmer, ''Stoddert's war: naval operations during the quasi-war with France'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barbary wars====
The Berbers along the Barbary Coast (modern day Libya) sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom. The U.S. paid protection money until 1801, when  President [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the [[Barbary States]], the [[First Barbary War]] followed. After the [[USS Philadelphia (1799)|U.S.S. ''Philadelphia'']] was captured in 1803, Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship, preventing Tripoli from using or selling it. In 1805, after [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]] captured the city of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]], Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty. The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping, until the [[Second Barbary War]] in 1815 ended the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lambert, ''The Barbary Wars: American Independence in the Atlantic World'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle erie.jpg|left|200px|thumb|&quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours.&quot; Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s [[Battle of Lake Erie|victory on Lake Erie]] in 1813 was an important turning point in the [[War of 1812]]. (Painting by William H. Powell, 1865)]]

===War of 1812===
{{Main|War of 1812}}
By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812: Conflict for a Continent'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; With Britain locked in a [[Napoleonic Wars|major war]] with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American  shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and [[Impressment|impressed]] seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the [[Royal Navy]], the U.S. attacked the [[British Empire]] by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front ([[Tecumseh's War]] and the [[Creek War]]) were more successful. After defeating [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the [[burning of Washington]] on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their [[Chesapeake Bay]] Campaign at the [[Battle of Baltimore]] and the British commander killed.  The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a [[Battle of New Orleans|one-sided military battle]] that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the [[Commanding officer|commanding general]] of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General [[Andrew Jackson]], who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation.  The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Canada never again went to war.  The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Borneman, ''1812: The War That Forged a Nation'' (2005) is an American perspective; Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) provides a Canadian perspective.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Mexico (1846–48)===
{{Main|Mexican-American War}}
[[File:Battle of Chapultepec.jpg|thumb|200px|American forces storming the &quot;[[Battle of Chapultepec|Halls of Montezuma]]&quot;]]
With the rapid expansion of the farming population, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] looked to the west for new lands, an idea which became known as &quot;[[Manifest Destiny]].&quot; In the [[Texas Revolution]] (1835–36), the settlers declared independence and defeated the Mexican army, but Mexico was determined to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the U.S. if it annexed Texas.  The U.S., much larger and more powerful, did annex Texas in 1845 and war broke out in 1846 over boundary issues.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Merry, ''A Country of Vast Designs: James K. Polk, the Mexican War and the Conquest of the American Continent'' (2009) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003WUYRZO/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Harvey Smith, ''The War with Mexico, Vol 1.'' (2 vol 1919), [http://books.google.com/books?id=WBkOAAAAIAAJ full text online]; Smith, ''The War with Mexico, Vol 2.'' (1919). [http://books.google.com/books?id=xhUOAAAAIAAJ full text online of Pulitzer prize winning history].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mexican-American War]] 1846–48, the U.S. Army under Generals [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Winfield Scott]] and others, invaded and after a series of victorious battles (and no major defeats) seized New Mexico and California, and also blockaded the coast, invaded northern Mexico, and invaded central Mexico, capturing the national capital. The peace terms involved American purchase of the area from California to New Mexico for $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;K. Jack Bauer, ''The Mexican War, 1846–1848''(1974); David S. Heidler, and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''The Mexican War.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil War (1861–1865)===
{{Main|American Civil War}}
[[File:Bodies on the battlefield at antietam.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Dead soldiers lie where they fell at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], the bloodiest day in American history. [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] after this battle.]]
Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]] and those south of it, primarily centered on the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South [[Secession|seceded]] from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the [[Confederate States of America]] or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]], whose garrison was loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur, ''The Civil War: A Concise History'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[American Civil War]]''' caught both sides unprepared. The Confederacy hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene, or else by wearing down the North's willingness to fight. The U.S. sought a quick victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The Confederates under [[Robert E. Lee]] tenaciously defended their capital until the very end.  The war spilled across the continent, and even to the high seas. Most of the material and personnel of the South were used up, while the North prospered.

The American Civil War is sometimes called the &quot;first modern war&quot; due to the mobilization (and destruction) of the civilian base.  It also is characterized by many technical innovations involving railroads, telegraphs, rifles,  [[trench warfare]], and  [[ironclad]] warships with turret guns.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Bacon, ''Sinews of War: How Technology, Industry, and Transportation Won the Civil War'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Civil War era (1865–1917)===
====Indian Wars (1865–1891)====
{{Main|Indian Wars}}
After the Civil War, population expansion, railroad construction, and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains.  Several tribes, especially the Sioux and Comanche, fiercely resisted confinement to reservations.  The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other,  [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]] were in charge. A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876, when Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] and two hundred plus members of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]] were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Northern Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]] nations.  The last significant conflict came in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Utley,  (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish-American War (1898)====
{{Main|Spanish-American War}}
[[File:Charge of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Charge by the [[Rough Riders]]]]
The [[Spanish-American War]] was a short decisive war marked by quick, overwhelming American victories at sea and on land against Spain. The Navy was well-prepared and won laurels, even as politicians tried (and failed) to have it redeployed to defend East Coast cities against potential threats from the feeble Spanish fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Leeke, ''Manila And Santiago: The New Steel Navy in the Spanish-American War'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Army performed well in combat in Cuba. However, it was too oriented to small posts in the West and not as well-prepared for an overseas conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Cosmas, ''An Army for Empire: The United States Army in the Spanish-American War'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied on volunteers and state militia units, which faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W.  Stewart, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch15.htm &quot;Emergence to World Power 1898–1902&quot; Ch. 15], in [http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ &quot;American Military History, Volume I: The United States Army and the Forging of a Nation, 1775–1917&quot;],  (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States freed Cuba (after an occupation by the U.S. Army). By the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|peace treaty]] Spain ceded to the United States its colonies of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=191 |title=The Philippines |author= |date=22 May 2011 |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=22 May 2011|quote=In December, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States for $20 million.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy set up coaling stations  there and in Hawaii (which voluntarily joined the U.S. in 1898).  The U.S. Navy now had a major forward presence  across the Pacific and (with the lease of [[Guantánamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba) a major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast and the Panama Canal.&lt;ref&gt;William Braisted, ''United States Navy in the Pacific, 1897–1909'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippine-American War (1899–1902)====
{{Main|Philippine–American War}}
The [[Philippine-American War]] (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between a group of [[First Philippine Republic|Filipino revolutionaries]] and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila]].  The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers (mostly from the National Guard) under General [[Elwell Otis]].  Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899, the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands. The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was captured by General [[Frederick Funston]] and his [[Philippine Scouts|Macabebe]] allies. Casualties included 1037 Americans killed in action and 3340 who died from disease; 20,000 rebels were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McAllister Linn, ''The Philippine War 1899–1902'' (University Press of Kansas, 2000). ISBN 0-7006-0990-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization===
The Navy was modernized in the 1880s, and by the 1890s had adopted the naval power strategy of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]--as indeed did every major navy. The old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships, bringing them in line with the navies of Britain and Germany. In 1907, most of the Navy's battleships, with several support vessels, dubbed the [[Great White Fleet]], were featured in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world. Ordered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy's capability to extend to the global theater.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Hendrix, ''Theodore Roosevelt's Naval Diplomacy: The U.S. Navy and the Birth of the American Century'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of War  [[Elihu Root]] (1899–1904) led the modernization of the Army. His goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a European-type general staff for planning was stymied by General [[Nelson A. Miles]] but did succeed in enlarging [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and establishing the [[U.S. Army War College]] as well as the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]]. Root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the Army's role in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, and wrote the charter of government for the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Hewes, Jr. ''From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900–1963'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral [[Bradley A. Fiske]] was at the vanguard of new technology in naval guns and gunnery, thanks to his innovations in fire control 1890–1910. He immediately grasped the potential for air power, and called for the development of a torpedo plane.  Fiske, as aide for operations in 1913–15 to Assistant Secretary [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], proposed a radical reorganization of the Navy to make it a war-fighting instrument. Fiske wanted to centralize authority in a chief of naval operations and an expert staff that would develop new strategies, oversee the construction of a larger fleet, coordinate war planning including force structure, mobilization plans, and industrial base, and insure that the US Navy possessed the best possible war machines. Eventually, the Navy adopted his reforms and by 1915 started to reorganize for possible involvement in the World War then underway.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Coletta, ''Admiral Bradley A. Fiske and the American Navy'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banana Wars (1898–1935)===
{{Main|Banana Wars}}
&quot;Banana Wars&quot; is an informal term for the minor intervention in Latin America from 1898 until 1934. These include military presence in [[Cuba]], [[Panama]] with the [[Panama Canal Zone]], [[Haiti]] (1915–1935), [[Dominican Republic]] (1916–1924) and [[Nicaragua]] (1912–1925) &amp; (1926–1933).  The U.S. Marine Corps began to specialize in long-term military occupation of these countries, primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the cause of local civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Lester D. Langley, ''The Banana Wars: United States Intervention in the Caribbean, 1898-1934'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moro Rebellion (1899–1913)===
{{Main|Moro Rebellion}}
The Moro Rebellion was an armed insurgency between [[Muslim Filipino]] tribes in the southern [[Philippines]] between 1899 and 1913.  Pacification was never complete as sporadic antigovernment insurgency continues into the 21st century, with American advisors helping the Philippine government forces.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Byler, &quot;Pacifying the Moros: American Military Government in the Southern Philippines, 1899–1913&quot; ''Military Review''  (May–June 2005) pp 41–45.

===Mexico (1910–1919)===
{{Main|Border War (1910–1919)}}
[[File:VillaUncleSamBerrymanCartoon.png|thumb|U.S. enters Mexico in 1916 to punish Pancho Villa]]
The [[Mexican Revolution]] involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones. Tens of thousands fled to the U.S. President Wilson sent U.S. forces [[U.S. occupation of Veracruz, 1914|to occupy the Mexican city]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] for six months in 1914. It was designed to show the U.S. was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on Americans, especially the April 9, 1914, &quot;[[Tampico Affair]]&quot;, which involved the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President [[Victoriano Huerta]].&lt;ref&gt;John S. D. Eisenhower, ''Intervention!: The United States and the Mexican Revolution, 1913-1917'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1916 [[Pancho Villa]] a Mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American city of Columbus New Mexico, with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bruce White and Francisco Villa, &quot;The Muddied Waters of Columbus, New Mexico,&quot; ''The Americas'' 32#1 (July 1975), pp. 72-98 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/980403 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Secret Service encouraged Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an intervention in Mexico which would distract the United States from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from Europe to support the intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico: Europe, the United States, and the Mexican Revolution'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson called up the state militias (National Guard) and sent them and the U.S. Army under General [[John J. Pershing]] to punish Villa in the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]. Villa fled, with the Americans in pursuit deep into Mexico, thereby arousing Mexican nationalism. By early 1917 President [[Venustiano Carranza]] had contained Villa and secured the border, so Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Hurst, ''Pancho Villa and Black Jack Pershing: The Punitive Expedition in Mexico'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Katz, &quot;Pancho Villa and the Attack on Columbus, New Mexico,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' 83#1 (1978), pp. 101-130 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1865904 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I (1917–1918)===
{{Main|American entry into World War I|American Expeditionary Forces}}
[[File:Returning Home, New York Times, 1919.JPG|thumb|200px|[[69th Infantry Regiment (United States)|69th Infantry Regiment]] parading upon returning to [[New York City]]]]
The United States originally wished to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914. However, it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack, even though its ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans [[unrestricted submarine warfare|resumed submarine attacks]], knowing that it would lead to American entry. When the U.S declared war, the U.S. army was still small by European standards and mobilization would take a year. Meanwhile the U.S. continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and initiated the first peacetime draft.&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick A. Clements, &quot;Woodrow Wilson and World War I,&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 34:1 (2004). pp 62+. [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5006516101 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial mobilization took longer than expected, so divisions were sent to Europe without equipment, relying instead on the British and French to supply them.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Venzon, ed., ''The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

By summer 1918, a million American soldiers, or &quot;[[doughboy]]s&quot; as they were often called, of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] were in Europe under the command of [[John J. Pershing]], with 25,000 more arriving every week. The failure of Germany's spring offensive exhausted its reserves and they were unable to launch new offensives.  The German Navy and home front then revolted and a [[Weimar Republic|new German government]] signed a conditional surrender, [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|the Armistice]], ending the war against the western front on November 11, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I''  (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Revolution===
The so-called [[Polar Bear Expedition]] was the involvement of U.S. troops, during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], in blocking the [[Bolshevik]]s in [[Arkhangelsk]], Russia in 1918 and 1919.

===1920s: Naval disarmament===
{{Main|Washington Naval Conference}}
The U.S. sponsored a major world conference to limit the naval armaments of world powers, including the U.S., Britain, Japan, and France, plus smaller nations.&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the Soviet Unions were not invited.&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] made the key proposal of each country to reduce its number of warships by a formula that was accepted. The conference enabled the great powers to reduce their navies and avoid conflict in the Pacific. The treaties remained in effect for ten years, but were not renewed as tensions escalated.&lt;ref&gt;Emily O. Goldman,  [http://books.google.com/?id=IQct3YvBRgUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sunken+Treaties:+Naval+Arms+Control+between+the+Wars&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q ''Sunken treaties'' (1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s: Neutrality Acts===
After the costly U.S. involvement in World War I, [[isolationism]] grew within the nation. Congress refused membership in the [[League of Nations]], and in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia, the gradually more restrictive [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] were passed, which were intended to prevent the U.S. from supporting either side in a war.  President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sought to support Britain, however, and in 1940 signed the [[Lend-Lease]] Act, which permitted an expansion of the &quot;cash and carry&quot; arms trade to develop with Britain, which controlled the Atlantic sea lanes.

Roosevelt favored the Navy (he was in effective charge in World War I), and used relief programs such as the [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] to support Navy yards and build warships.  For example in 1933 he authorized $238 million in PWA funds for thirty-two new ships. The Army Air Corps received only $11 million, which barely covered replacements and allowed no expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery S. Underwood, ''The wings of democracy: the influence of air power on the Roosevelt Administration, 1933-1941'' (1991) pp 34-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II (1941–1945)===
{{Main|Military history of the United States during World War II|Air warfare of World War II#United States: The U.S. Air Force|Special relationship}}
Starting in 1940 (18 months before Pearl Harbor) the nation mobilized, giving high priority to air power.  American involvement in World War II in 1940-41 was limited to providing [[Lend-Lease|war material and financial support]] to Britain, the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[Republic of China]]. The US entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]] on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese naval forces soon seized American, Dutch and British possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia, except for Australia, which became a main American forward base along with Hawaii. 

[[File:Arizona's magazine explosion-Pearl Harbor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Explosion aboard [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS Arizona]] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].]]
The loss of eight battleships and 2000 sailors and airmen at Pearl Harbor forced the US to rely on its remaining [[aircraft carrier]]s, which won a major victory over Japan at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] just six months into the war, and on its growing submarine fleet.  The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an [[Pacific War|island hopping]] campaign across the central and south Pacific in 1943–45, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. During 1942 and 1943, the US deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the [[strategic bombing]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] in November 1942, [[Operation Husky|Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] in 1943, [[D-Day|France]] in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the Soviet invasion from the east. That led to the [[Victory in Europe Day|surrender of Nazi Germany]] in May 1945. In the Pacific, the US experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] in 1945 led the US to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of American lives. The U.S. used [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] to shock the Japanese leadership, which (combined with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria) quickly caused the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender of Japan]].

The United States was able to mobilize quickly, eventually becoming the dominant military power in most theaters of the war (excepting only eastern Europe), and the industrial might of the US economy became a major factor in the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] mobilization of resources.  Strategic and tactical lessons learned by the US, such as the importance of [[air superiority]] and the dominance of the [[aircraft carrier]] in naval actions, continue to guide US military doctrine more than 65 years later.

[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Douglas MacArthur|General of the Army MacArthur]] [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|signs]] on behalf of the Allies.]]
World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country's greatest triumph, and the soldiers of World War II are frequently referred to as &quot;the greatest generation.&quot; Over 16 million served (about 11% of the population), and over 400,000 died during the war. The U.S. emerged as one of the two undisputed [[superpower]]s along with the Soviet Union, and unlike the Soviet Union, the US homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war. During and following World War II, the United States and Britain developed an increasingly strong, if one-sided, defence and intelligence relationship. Manifestations of this include extensive basing of US forces in the UK, shared intelligence, shared military technology (e.g. nuclear technology) and shared procurement.

===Cold War era (1945–1991)===
{{Main|Cold War}}
Following World War II, the United States emerged as a global [[superpower]] vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]]. In this period of some forty years, the United States provided foreign military aid and direct involvement in [[proxy war]]s against the Soviet Union. It was the principal foreign actor in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] during this era. Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under a concept of [[mutually assured destruction]] with the Soviet Union.

====Postwar Military Reorganization (1947)====
The [[National Security Act of 1947]], meeting the need for a military reorganization to complement the U.S. superpower role, combined and replaced the former Department of the Navy and War Department with a single [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]-level Department of Defense. The act also created the [[NSA|National Security Council]], the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]], and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].

====Korean War (1950–1953)====
{{Main|Korean War}}
[[File:Battle of Inchon.png|thumb|200 px|Beachhead at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]]]]
The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its [[United Nations]] allies and the [[Communism|communist]] powers under influence of the Soviet Union (also a UN member nation) and the People's Republic of China (which later also gained UN membership). The principal combatants were North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the [[United Nations]]. Allies of North Korea included the People's Republic of China, which supplied military forces, and the Soviet Union, which supplied [[combat advisors]] and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the Chinese and North Korean troops.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Millett, &quot;A Reader's Guide To The Korean War,&quot; ''Journal of Military History'' (1997) Vol. 61 No. 3; p. 583+ [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/jfq_pubs/jfq2407.pdf online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming [[Douglas MacArthur]] commander of its [[United Nations Command (Korea)|forces]], and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan]], gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]], cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the [[Yalu River]] on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a [[Rollback]] strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a [[Containment]] policy to split the country.&lt;ref&gt;James I. Matray, &quot;Truman's Plan for Victory: National Self-Determination and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel Decision in Korea,&quot; ''Journal of American History,'' Sept. 1979, Vol. 66 Issue 2, pp 314–333, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1900879 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Sandler,  ed., ''The Korean War: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon crisis of 1958====
In the [[Lebanon crisis of 1958]] that threatened civil war,  [[Operation Blue Bat]] deployed several hundred Marines to bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government from July 15 to October 25, 1958.

====Dominican Intervention====
{{Main|Operation Power Pack}}

On April 28, 1965, 400 Marines were landed in Santo Domingo to evacuate the American Embassy and foreign nationals after dissident Dominican armed forces attempted to overthrow the ruling civilian junta. By mid-May, peak strength of 23,850 U.S. soldiers, Marines, and Airmen were in the Dominican Republic and some 38 naval ships were positioned offshore. They evacuated nearly 6,500 men, women, and children of 46 nations, and distributed more than 8 million tons of food.

====Vietnam War (1964–1975)====

{{Main|Vietnam War}}
{{See also|United States Air Force in Thailand|Laotian Civil War|l2=Secret War}}
The [[Vietnam War]] was a war fought between 1959 and 1975 on the ground in [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] and bordering areas of [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] (''see'' [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]]) and in the [[strategic bombing]] (''see'' [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]) of [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam|North Vietnam]]. American advisors came in the late 1950s to help the RVN (Republic of Vietnam) combat Communist insurgents known as &quot;Viet Cong.&quot; Major American  military involvement began in 1964, after Congress provided President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] with  blanket approval for presidential use of force in  the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;John Prados, ''Vietnam: The History of an Unwinnable War, 1945-1975'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the [[Republic of Vietnam]] ([[South Vietnam]] or the &quot;RVN&quot;), the United States, supplemented by South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. The allies fought against the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) as well as the National Liberation Front (NLF, also known as Viet communists [[Viet Cong]]), or &quot;VC&quot;, a guerrilla force within South Vietnam. The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet Union and China, turning Vietnam into a [[proxy war]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Atwood Lawrence, ''The Vietnam War: A Concise International History'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The military history of the American side of the war involved different strategies over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker, ''Vietnam'' (2000); for coverage of wach major operation see Stanley I. Kutler, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War'' (1996) and Spencer C. Tucker, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;   The bombing campaigns of the Air Force were tightly controlled by the White House for political reasons, and until 1972 avoided the main Northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong and concentrated on bombing jungle supply trails, especially the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Clodfelter, ''The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial Army commander was [[William Westmoreland]] whose strategy involved systematic defeat of all enemy forces in the field, despite heavy American casualties that alienated public opinion back home.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Sorley, ''Westmoreland: The General Who Lost Vietnam'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Damage Done!.jpg|thumb|200px|[[United States Embassy, Saigon|United States Embassy]] following the [[Tet Offensive]].]]
The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of [[containment]] of [[Communism]] in south Asia, but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles, corruption and incompetence in the [[ARVN|Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], and ever increasing protests at home. The [[Tet Offensive]] in 1968, although a major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated, marked the psychological turning point in the war. With President [[Richard M. Nixon]] opposed to containment and more interested in achieving  détente with both the Soviet Union and China, American policy shifted to &quot;Vietnamization,&quot; – providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves. After more than 57,000 dead and many more wounded, American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory, and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Schulzinger, ''Time for War: The United States and Vietnam, 1941–1975.'' (1997) [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=59258841&amp;oplinknum=2 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in American politics. One side views the war as a necessary part of the [[Containment]] policy, which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare.  Others note the U.S. made major strategic gains as the Communists were defeated in Indonesia, and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing for American support, at the expense of their allies in Hanoi. Critics  see the conflict as a &quot;quagmire&quot;--an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hagopian, ''The Vietnam War in American Memory: Veterans, Memorials, and the Politics of Healing'' (2009) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1558496939 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The draft became extremely unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;George Q. Flynn, ''The draft, 1940–1973'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers.  That raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall American society and values; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best American values.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Rostker, ''I want you!: the evolution of the All-Volunteer Force'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grenada====
In October, 1983, a violent power struggle threatened American lives in the small Caribbean nation of Grenada.  Neighboring nations asked the U.S. to intervene. The invasion was a hurriedly devised grouping of paratroopers, Marines, Rangers, and special operations forces in [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]]. Over a thousand Americans quickly seized the entire island, taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners, especially Cubans.&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Tiwathia, ''The Grenada war: anatomy of a low-intensity conflict'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Adkin, ''Urgent Fury: The Battle for Grenada: The Truth Behind the Largest U.S. Military Operation Since Vietnam'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beirut====

In 1983 fighting between [[PLO|Palestinian refugees]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] factions reignited that nation's long-running civil war. A UN agreement brought an [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|international force of peacekeepers]] to occupy Beirut and guarantee security. US Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and French forces. On October 23, 1983, a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and [[Marine barracks bombing|destroyed the Marine barracks]], killing 241 Marines; seconds later, a second bomber leveled a French barracks, killing 58. Subsequently the US Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon. While US President [[Ronald Reagan]] was initially defiant, political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Col. Timothy J. Geraghty, USMC (Ret.)|title=Peacekeepers at War: Beirut 1983—The Marine Commander Tells His Story|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K0LJu7wr1IEC|year=2009|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.}} ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{main|Bombing of Libya (1986)}}
Code-named &quot;Operation ''El Dorado Canyon''&quot;, comprised the joint [[United States]] [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] air-strikes against [[Libya]] on April 15, 1986. The attack was carried out in response to the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]], and resulted in the killing of 45 officers and 15 civilians.

====Panama====
On December 20, 1989 the [[United States invasion of Panama|United States invaded Panama]], mainly from U.S. bases within the then-[[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]], to oust dictator and international drug trafficker [[Manuel Noriega]].  American forces quickly overwhelmed the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega was captured on January 3, 1990 and imprisoned in the U.S. and a new government was installed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Donnelly, Margaret Roth and Caleb Baker, ''Operation Just Cause: The Storming of Panama'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persian Gulf War (1990–1991)====
The [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] was a conflict between [[Iraq]] and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began with the [[Iraq]]i invasion of [[Kuwait]] in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the [[United Nations]] against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as &quot;permanently disabled&quot; according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs ([http://www.ngwrc.org/?page=article&amp;id=158 National Gulf War Resource Center]; see also [[Gulf War Syndrome]]). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Atkinson, ''Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wisconsin Shoots.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS Wisconsin]] fires on Iraqi positions in Kuwait.]]
Before the war, many observers believed the US and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After nearly 50 years of [[proxy war]]s, and constant fears of another war in Europe between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with [[Iran]], and they were well-equipped with late model [[Soviet]] tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from [[Vietnam]] nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.

However, the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning. The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as [[stealth aircraft]] and [[infrared]] sights, quickly turned the air war into a &quot;[[turkey shoot]]&quot;. The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from [[wild weasel]] aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]], and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.

After just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control, US President [[George H. W. Bush]] ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.&lt;ref&gt;Marc J. O'Reilly, ''Unexceptional: America's Empire in the Persian Gulf, 1941–2007'' (2008)  p 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Persian Gulf War, to protect minority populations, the US, Britain, and France declared and maintained [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]] in northern and southern Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested. The no-fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no-fly zones in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.

====Somalia====
{{Main|Operation Restore Hope|UNOSOM II}}

US troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in [[Somalia]] beginning in 1992. By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]], whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a raid in downtown Mogadishu, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]. Eighteen American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob.  Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention. The book ''[[Black Hawk Down (book)|Black Hawk Down]]'' was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later [[Black Hawk Down (film)|movie of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;John L. Hirsch and Robert B. Oakley, ''Somalia and Operation Restore Hope: Reflections on Peacemaking and Peacekeeping'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haiti====
{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}

Operation Uphold Democracy (September 19, 1994 – March 31, 1995) was an intervention designed to reinstate the elected President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], who was reported to have died in office during the bombing of the presidential palace. The operation was effectively authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Ballard, ''Upholding democracy: the United States military campaign in Haiti, 1994–1997'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yugoslavia====
During the war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the US operated in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as part of the NATO-led multinational implementation force ([[IFOR]]) in ''[[Operation Joint Endeavour]]'' . The USA was one of the NATO member countries who bombed Yugoslavia between March 24 and June 9, 1999 during the [[Kosovo War]] and later contributed to the multinational force [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Holbrooke, ''To End a War'' (1999) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0375753605 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on Terrorism (2001–present)===
The [[War on Terrorism]] is a global effort by the governments of several countries (primarily the United States and its principal allies) to neutralize international [[Terrorism|terrorist]] groups (primarily [[Radical Islamism(disambiguation)|radical Islamist]] terrorist groups, including [[al-Qaeda]]) and ensure that [[rogue nations]] no longer support terrorist activities. It has been adopted as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.

====Afghanistan====
[[File:US forces Operation Enduring Freedom.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces soldiers]] on [[Dragoon|horseback]] in November 2001|alt=Ten horses with riders on the side of a hill]]
The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|intervention in Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]] – Afghanistan) to depose that country's [[Taliban]] government and destroy training camps associated with al-Qaida is understood to have been the opening, and in many ways defining, campaign of the broader War on Terrorism. The emphasis on Special Operations Forces (SOF), political negotiation with autonomous military units, and the use of proxy militaries marked a significant change from prior U.S. military approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher N. Koontz,    [http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/enduring_voices/index.html  ''Enduring Voices: Oral Histories of the U.S. Army Experience in Afghanistan, 2003–2005'' (2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In January 2002, the U.S. sent more than 1,200 troops (later raised to 2,000) to assist the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] in combating terrorist groups linked to al-Qaida, such as [[Abu Sayyaf]], under [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines]]. Operations are taking place mostly in the [[Sulu Archipelago]], where terrorists and other groups are active. The majority of troops provide [[logistics]]; however, many are Special Forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups.

===Iraq===
[[File:USMarineTankinBaghdad.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[U.S. 1st Marine Division|Marine Corps]] [[M1 Abrams]] tank patrols a Baghdad street in April 2003.]]
{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq|Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present}}
After the lengthy [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] leave [[Iraq]], which was refused, a [[Coalition of the willing|coalition]] led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered [[Iraq]] primarily through their [[staging area]] in [[Kuwait]]. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi [[peshmerga|Kurdish militia]], estimated to number upwards of 50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, Hussein and the [[Ba'ath Party]] were forcibly removed, followed by 9 years of military presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups.

===Libyan intervention===
{{Main|Operation Odyssey Dawn}}
As a result of the [[Libyan civil war]], the United Nations enacted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], which imposed a no-fly zone over Libya, and the protection of civilians from the forces of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. The United States, along with [[Libyan no-fly zone#Forces committed|Britain, France and several other nations]], committed a coalition force against Gaddafi's forces. On 19 March, the first U.S. action was taken when 114 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk missiles]] launched by US and UK warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the Gaddafi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/03/20/explosions-gunfire-heard-tripoli-allies-continue-military-strikes-libya/|agency=FOX News|title=U.S. Steps Up Assault on Libya, Firing Four More Tomahawk Missiles at Air Defense Systems|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. continued to play a major role in [[Operation Unified Protector]], the [[NATO]]-directed mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalition's actions in the theater. Throughout the conflict however, the U.S. maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect civilians, while the real conflict was between Gaddafi's loyalists and [[anti-Gaddafi forces|Libyan rebels]] fighting to depose him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Bloomberg|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-21/obama-says-no-conflict-in-u-s-policy-un-libya-mandate-1-.html|title=Obama Says No Conflict in U.S. Policy, UN Libya Mandate|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|first1=Julianna|last1=Goldman|first2=Nicholas|last2=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, American  [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] were also deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/nato-wants-drones-target-misrata|agency=The Guardian|title=Drones can be used by Nato forces in Libya, says Obama|first=Nick|last=Hopkins|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
