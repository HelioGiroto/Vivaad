The '''death of [[Alexander the Great]]''' and subsequent related events have been the subjects of debates. According to a [[Babylonian astronomical diary]], Alexander died between the evening of June 10 and the evening of June 11, 323 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t41.html|title=A contemporary account of the death of Alexander|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in [[Babylon]]. 

[[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] and local residents wept at the news of the death, while [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] subjects shaved their heads.&lt;ref name =&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Freeman| first = Philip|title = Alexander the Great| publisher = Simon and Schuster| year = 2011| page = 320| isbn =1-4165-9280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sisygambis]], having learned of Alexander's death, refused sustenance and died a few days later.&lt;ref name =&quot;Quest&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Chugg| first = Andrew|title = The Quest for the Tomb of Alexander the Great | publisher = Lulu.com| year = 2007| page = 25| isbn =0-9556790-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians vary in their assessments of primary sources about Alexander's death, which results in different views.

==Background==
In February 323 BC, Alexander ordered his armies to prepare for the march to Babylon.&lt;ref name =&quot;Lendering&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander16.html|title=Death in Babylon|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|author=[[Jona Lendering]]|accessdate=Aug 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Arrian]], after crossing the [[Tigris]] Alexander was met by [[Chaldea]]ns, who advised him not to enter the city because their deity [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] had warned them that to do so at that time would be fatal for Alexander.&lt;ref name =&quot;Arrian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t63.html#2|title=Alexander and the Chaldaeans|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|accessdate=Aug 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chaldeans also warned Alexander against marching westwards as he would then look to the setting sun, a symbol of decline.&lt;ref name =&quot;Arrian&quot;/&gt; It was suggested that he enter Babylon via the Royal Gate, in the western wall, where he would face to the east. Alexander followed this advice, but the route turned to be unfavorable because of swampy terrain.&lt;ref name =&quot;Arrian&quot;/&gt; According to [[Jona Lendering]], &quot;it seems that in May 323&quot; the Babylonian [[astrology|astrologers]] tried to avert the misfortune by substituting Alexander with an ordinary person on the Babylonian throne, who would take the brunt of the omen.&lt;ref name =&quot;Lendering&quot;/&gt; The Greeks and Macedonians, however, did not understand that ritual.&lt;ref name =&quot;Lendering&quot;/&gt;
===Prophecy of Calanus===

[[Calanus of India|Calanus]] was likely to be [[Hindu]] [[Naga sadhu]], whom Greeks called [[gymnosophists]]. He had accompanied the Greek army back from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], upon request by Alexander. He was seventy-three years of age at that time. However, when Persian weather and travel fatigue weakened him, he informed Alexander that he would rather die than live disabled. He decided to take away his life by [[self-immolation]]. Although, Alexander tried to desist him from doing so but upon the insistence of Calanus, Alexander relented and the job of building a [[pyre]] was entrusted to [[Ptolemy (son of Seleucus)|Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the Great|year=1973|publisher=Robin Lax Fox|pages=416|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UGApAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=calanus+fakir&amp;dq=calanus+fakir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V71kT4nULM-mrAf8p5y9Bw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;The place where this incident took place was [[Susa]] in the year 322 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yādnāmah-ʾi Panjumīn Kungrih-ʾi Bayn al-Milalī-i Bāstānshināsī va Hunar-i Īrān|year=1972|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Arts, Iran.

At the time of death of Calanus, Alexander, however, did not have any plan to go to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic , Volume 133|year=1968|pages=64|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=V71kT4nULM-mrAf8p5y9Bw&amp;id=M8YvAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=calanus+fakir&amp;q=meet+babylon#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The philosophical books of Cicero|year=1989|publisher=Duckworth|pages=186|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L1MEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=calanus+fakir&amp;dq=calanus+fakir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V71kT4nULM-mrAf8p5y9Bw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;No one understood the meaning of his words ''We shall meet in Babylon''. It was only after Alexander fell sick and died in Babylon, Greeks came to realize what Calanus wanted to say.

==Causes==
Proposed causes of Alexander's death included alcoholic liver disease and [[strychnine]] poisoning, but little data support either version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15081504|title=The death of Alexander the Great: malaria or typhoid fever?|publisher =Infectious Disease Clinics of North America 2004 Mar;18(1):53-63|author=Cunha BA|doi=10.1016/S0891-5520(03)00090-4|volume=18|issue=1|year=2004|month=March|journal=Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am.|pages=53–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the University of Maryland School of Medicine report of 1998, Alexander probably died of [[typhoid fever]]&lt;ref name =&quot;UMM&quot;/&gt; (which, along with [[malaria]], was common in ancient Babylon&lt;ref name =&quot;Musso&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanehealthcare.com/Article.asp?art_id=662|title=MEGAS ALEXANDROS (Alexander The Great ): His Death Remains a Medical Mystery |author=Carlos G. Musso|publisher =Humane Medicine Health Care|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the week before Alexander's death, historical accounts mention chills, sweats, exhaustion and high fever, typical [[symptom]]s of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever.&lt;ref name =&quot;UMM&quot;/&gt; According to David W. Oldach from the [[University of Maryland Medical Center]], Alexander also had &quot;severe [[abdominal pain]], causing him to cry out in [[agony]]&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;UMM&quot;/&gt; The associated account, however, comes from unreliable [[Alexander romance]]. 

Previous most popular theories hold that Alexander either died of malaria or was poisoned. Other [[Retrospective diagnosis|retrodiagnoses]] include noninfectious diseases as well.&lt;ref name =&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no12/03-0288.htm#1|title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis|author=John S. Marr, Charles H. Calisher|publisher =[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Andrew Chugg, there is evidence Alexander died of malaria, having contracted it two weeks before his death while sailing in the marshes to inspect flood defences.&lt;ref name =&quot;Chugg&quot;/&gt; Chugg based his argument on ''Ephemerides'' by otherwise unknown Diodotus of Erythrae, although the authenticity of this source has been questioned.&lt;ref name =&quot;Chugg&quot;/&gt; It was also noted that the absence of the signature fever curve of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (the expected parasite, given Alexander's travel history) diminishes the possibility of malaria.&lt;ref name =&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt; The malaria version was nonetheless supported by [[Paul Cartledge]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Chugg&quot;/&gt; In ''Alexander the Great: The Death of a God'', [[Paul C. Doherty]] claimed that Alexander was poisoned with [[arsenic]] by his possibly illegitimate half-brother [[Ptolemy I Soter]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Chugg&quot;/&gt; Throughout the centuries suspicions of possible poisoning have fallen on a number of alleged perpetrators, including one of Alexander's wives, his generals, his illegitimate half-brother or the royal cup-bearer.&lt;ref name =&quot;Chugg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderstomb.com/main/deathofalexander/IoS6on7Aug05b.JPG|title=Disease, not conflict, ended the reign of Alexander the Great|publisher =''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poisoning version is featured particularly in politically motivated ''Liber de Morte Testamentoque Alexandri'' (''The Book On the Death and Testament of Alexander''), which tries to discredit the family of [[Antipater]]. It was argued that the book was compiled in [[Polyperchon]]'s circle, not before ca. 317 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Alexander%27s+last+days%3A+malaria+and+mind+games%3F-a0221920136|title=Alexander's last days: malaria and mind games?|publisher =''[[Acta Classica]]''|author=John Atkinson, Elsie Truter, Etienne Truter|date=Jan 1, 2009|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiologist John Marr and Charles Calisher put forward the [[West Nile fever]] as possible cause of Alexander's death. This version was deemed as &quot;fairly compelling&quot; by the [[University of Rhode Island]] epidemiologist Thomas Mather, who nonetheless noted that the West Nile virus tends to kill the elders or those with weakened [[immune systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gideononline.com/reviews/nature2003/|title=Nature-Alexander the Great|publisher =[[Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network|GIDEON]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version of Marr and Calisher was also criticized by Burke A. Cunha from [[Winthrop University Hospital]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Cunha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol10no7/04-0039_104_396_320.htm|title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis|publisher =[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis of other authors in response to Marr and Calisher, the West Nile virus could not have infected humans before the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name =&quot;Cunha&quot;/&gt;

Other causes that have been put forward include [[acute pancreatitis]] provoked by &quot;heavy alcohol consumption and a very rich meal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9252868|title=Did Alexander the Great die of acute pancreatitis?|publisher =''Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology'' 1997 Jun;24(4):294-6|author=Sbarounis CN|doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00031|volume=24|issue=4|year=1997|month=June|journal=J. Clin. Gastroenterol.|pages=294–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[acute endocarditis]],&lt;ref name =&quot;Musso&quot;/&gt; [[schistosomiasis]] brought on by ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'',&lt;ref name =&quot;Musso&quot;/&gt; and [[porphyria]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Musso&quot;/&gt; [[Fritz Schachermeyr]] proposed [[leukemia]] and malaria. When Alexander's symptoms were entered to the [[Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network]], [[influenza]] gained the highest probability (41.2%) on the list of [[Differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]].&lt;ref name =&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt; However, according to Cunha, the symptoms and time course of Alexander's disease are inconsistent with influenza, as well as with malaria, schistosomiasis and poisoning in particular.&lt;ref name =&quot;Cunha&quot;/&gt;

==Body preservation==
[[File:Funeral of Iskander.jpg|thumb|Funeral of Iskander-Pallbearers carry his coffin draped with brocaded silk and his turban at one end. In Nizami's version Iskandar fell ill and died near Babylon. Because he believed he had been poisoned, no antidotes could revive him.]]
One ancient account reports that the planning and construction of an appropriate funerary cart to convey the body out from Babylon took two years from the time of Alexander's death.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/alexander/tomb.html|title=Hunting Alexander's Tomb|publisher =Archaeology.org|author=Robert S. Bianchi|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly how the body was preserved for about two years before it was moved from Babylon. In 1889 [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] suggested that the body was submerged in a vat of honey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Aufderheide| first =Arthur|title = The scientific study of mummies| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2003| pages = 261–262| isbn =0-521-81826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Plutarch]] reported treatment by [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|Egyptian embalmers]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;/&gt; 

Egyptian and [[Chaldea]]n embalmers who arrived on June 16 are said to have attested to Alexander's lifelike appearance.&lt;ref name =&quot;Quest&quot;/&gt; This was interpreted as a complication of [[typhoid fever]], known as [[ascending paralysis]], which causes a person to appear dead prior to death.&lt;ref name =&quot;UMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/bug.htm|title=INTESTINAL BUG LIKELY KILLED ALEXANDER THE GREAT|publisher =[[University of Maryland Medical Center]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resting place==
On its way back to Macedonia, the funerary cart with Alexander's body was met in [[Syria]] by one of Alexander's generals, the future ruler [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. In late in 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to [[Alexandria]] for reburial&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;/&gt; (by [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]] in c. 280 BC, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]). Later [[Ptolemy Philopator]] placed Alexander's body in Alexandria's communal mausoleum.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;/&gt; Shortly after the death of [[Cleopatra]], Alexander's resting place was visited by [[Augustus]], who is said to have placed flowers on the tomb and a golden [[diadem]] upon Alexander's head.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;/&gt; By the 4th century AD the resting place of Alexander was no longer known; later authors, such as [[Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]], [[Al-Masudi]] and [[Leo the African]], report having seen Alexander's tomb, but do not specify its location.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bianchi&quot;/&gt; According to one legend, the body lies in a [[crypt]] beneath an early Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/110852.stm|title=Alexander's death riddle is 'solved' |publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011|date=June 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
