The '''history of telecommunication''' began with the use of [[smoke signal]]s and [[drum (communication)|drum]]s in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]] and parts of [[Asia]]. In the 1790s, the first fixed [[semaphore line|semaphore systems]] emerged in [[Europe]]; however it was not until the 1830s that electrical [[telecommunication]] systems started to appear. This article details the history of telecommunication and the individuals who helped make telecommunication systems what they are today. The history of telecommunication is an important part of the larger [[history of communication]].

== Early telecommunications ==
{{Main|Beacon|Optical telegraphy}}

Early telecommunications included [[smoke signal]]s and [[drum (communication)|drum]]s. [[Talking drum]]s were used by natives in [[Africa]], [[New Guinea]] and [[South America]], and smoke signals in [[North America]] and [[China]]. Contrary to what one might think, these systems were often used to do more than merely announce the presence of a camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquiry.net/outdoor/native/sign/smoke-signal.htm Native American Smoke Signals], William Tomkins, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/instrument/pages/tlkdrum_gnrl.html Talking Drums], Instrument Encyclopedia, Cultural Heritage for Community Outreach, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, a French engineer, [[Claude Chappe]] built the first visual telegraphy (or [[Semaphore line|semaphore]]) system between [[Lille]] and [[Paris]]. This was followed by a line from [[Strasbourg]] to [[Paris]]. In 1794, a Swedish engineer, [[Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz|Abraham Edelcrantz]] built a quite different system from [[Stockholm]] to [[Drottningholm]]. As opposed to Chappe's system which involved pulleys rotating beams of wood, Edelcrantz's system relied only upon shutters and was therefore faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chappe.ec-lyon.fr/ Les Télégraphes Chappe], Cédrick Chatenet, l'Ecole Centrale de Lyon, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However semaphore as a communication system suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers often at intervals of only ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/itudoc/gs/promo/tsb/88192.pdf CCIT/ITU-T 50 Years of Excellence], International Telecommunication Union, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early experiment in [[electrical telegraph]]y was an 'electrochemical' telegraph created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by [[Països Catalans|Catalan]] [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard1&quot; /&gt; Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) in order to visually represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electrical current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message, albeit at a very low [[baud]] rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard1&quot;&gt;Jones, R. Victor [http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/images/history/von_Soem.html Samuel Thomas von Sömmering's &quot;Space Multiplexed&quot; Electrochemical Telegraph (1808-10)], Harvard University website. Attributed to &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Oxc7AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Semaphore+to+Satellite,Published+by+the+International+Telecommunication+Union,+Geneva+1965&amp;dq=Semaphore+to+Satellite,Published+by+the+International+Telecommunication+Union,+Geneva+1965&amp;ei=XdL9SfrCIoOgNcChzLkK Semaphore to Satellite]&quot; , International Telecommunication Union, Geneva 1965. Retrieved 2009-05-01&lt;/ref&gt; The principal disadvantage to the system was its prohibitive cost, due to having to manufacture and string-up the multiple wire circuits it employed, as opposed to the single wire (with ground return) used by later telegraphs.

The first commercial electrical telegraph was constructed in [[England]] by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] and Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]]. It used the deflection of needles to represent messages and started operating over twenty-one kilometres (thirteen miles) of the [[Great Western Railway]] on 9 April 1839. Both Wheatstone and Cooke viewed their device as &quot;an improvement to the [existing] electromagnetic telegraph&quot; not as a new device.

On the other side of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Samuel Morse]] independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. Soon after he was joined by [[Alfred Vail]] who developed the register &amp;mdash; a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape. This was demonstrated successfully over three miles (five kilometres) on 6 January 1838 and eventually over forty miles (sixty-four kilometres) between [[Washington, DC]] and [[Baltimore]] on 24 May 1844. The patented invention proved lucrative and by 1851 telegraph lines in the [[United States]] spanned over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm The Electromagnetic Telegraph], J. B. Calvert, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time. Earlier transatlantic cables installed in 1857 and 1858 only operated for a few days or weeks before they failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ The Atlantic Cable], Bern Dibner, Burndy Library Inc., 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The international use of the telegraph has sometimes been dubbed the &quot;[[Victorian Internet]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Redfern, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4475394.stm Wiring up the 'Victorian internet']'', [[BBC News]], 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric telephone was invented in the 1870s, based on earlier work with harmonic (multi-signal) telegraphs. The first commercial telephone services were set up in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of [[New Haven]] and [[London]]. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries. The technology grew quickly from this point, with inter-city lines being built and [[telephone exchange]]s in every major city of the United States by the mid-1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm Connected Earth: The telephone], BT, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html History of AT&amp;T], AT&amp;T, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Arthur W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1906 |month=January |title=Communication By Wire And &quot;Wireless&quot;: The Wonders of Telegraph and Telephone |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIII |issue= |pages=8408–8422 |id= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=3IfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8408|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, transatlantic voice communication remained impossible for customers until January 7, 1927 when a connection was established using radio. However no cable connection existed until [[TAT-1]] was inaugurated on September 25, 1956 providing 36 telephone circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cables/CableTimeLine/index1951.htm History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy], Bill Glover, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Bell and co-inventor [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] conducted the world's first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by [[photophone]]s. The scientific principles of their invention would not be utilized for several decades, when they were first deployed in military and [[fiber-optic communication]]s.

== Radio and television ==
{{Main|History of radio|History of television}}

In 1832, [[James Bowman Lindsay|James Lindsay]] gave a classroom demonstration of [[wireless telegraphy]] to his students.  By 1854, he was able to demonstrate a transmission across the [[Firth of Tay]] from [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]] to [[Woodhaven, Fife|Woodhaven]], a distance of two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km), using water as the transmission medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/centlib/jbl/jblchron.htm James Bowman Lindsay], Macdonald Black, Dundee City Council, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[Franklin Institute]] in 1893, [[Nikola Tesla]] described and demonstrated in detail the principles of wireless telegraphy. The apparatus that he used contained all the elements that were incorporated into [[radio]] systems before the development of the [[vacuum tube]]. However it was not until 1900 that [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Reginald Fessenden]] was able to wirelessly transmit a human voice. In December 1901, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] established wireless communication between Britain and Newfoundland, earning him the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1909 (which he shared with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm Tesla Biography], Ljubo Vujovic, Tesla Memorial Society of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1925, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] publicly demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette pictures at the London department store [[Selfridges]].  In October 1925, Baird was successful in obtaining moving pictures with [[halftone]] shades, which were by most accounts the first true television pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baird Television Website&quot;&gt;[http://www.bairdtelevision.com The Baird Television Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a public demonstration of the improved device on 26 January 1926 again at [[Selfridges]]. Baird's first devices relied upon the [[Nipkow disk]] and thus became known as the [[mechanical television]]. It formed the basis of semi-experimental broadcasts done by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] beginning September 30, 1929.

However for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by [[Philo Farnsworth]] and crude silhouette images were demonstrated to his family on September 7, 1927.  Farnsworth's device would compete with the concurrent work of [[Kalman Tihanyi]] and [[Vladimir Zworykin]].  Zworykin's camera, based on Tihanyi's Radioskop, which later would be known as the [[Iconoscope]], had the backing of the influential [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA).  In the United States, court action between Farnsworth and RCA would resolve in Farnsworth's favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/farnsworth.html Philo Farnsworth], Neil Postman, [[TIME Magazine]], 29 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Logie Baird]] switched from mechanical television and became a pioneer of colour television using cathode-ray tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Baird Television Website&quot;/&gt;

After mid-century the spread of coaxial cable and [[microwave radio relay]] allowed [[television network]]s to spread across even large countries.

== Computer networks and the Internet ==
:''Main articles: [[Computer_networking#History_of_computer_networks|Computer Networking -History]] and [[History of the Internet]]''

On September 11, 1940, [[George Stibitz]] was able to transmit problems using [[teletype]] to his Complex Number Calculator in [[New York]] and receive the computed results back at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/stibitz.htm George Stibitz], Kerry Redshaw, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration of a centralized computer or [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] with remote dumb terminals remained popular throughout the 1950s. However it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] &amp;mdash; a technology that would allow chunks of data to be sent to different computers  without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on December 5, 1969 between the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[Stanford Research Institute]], the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. This network would become [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hafner | first =  Katie  | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1973, the first non-US node was added to the network belonging to [[Norway]]'s NORSAR project. This was shortly followed by a node in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norsar.no/NORSAR/history/internet.html NORSAR and the Internet: Together since 1973], NORSAR, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ARPANET]]'s development centred around the [[Request for Comment]] process and on April 7, 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the [[Internet]] and many of the protocols the Internet relies upon today were specified through this process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] v4 (IPv4) and  RFC 793 introduced the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) &amp;mdash; thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today. A more relaxed transport protocol that, unlike TCP, did not guarantee the orderly delivery of packets called the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) was submitted on 28 August 1980 as RFC 768. An e-mail protocol, [[SMTP]], was introduced in August 1982 by RFC 821 and [[HTTP|http://1.0]] a protocol that would make the hyperlinked Internet possible was introduced on May 1996 by RFC 1945.

However not all important developments were made through the [[Request for Comment]] process. Two popular link protocols for [[local area network]]s (LANs) also appeared in the 1970s. A patent for the [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] protocol was filed by [[Olof Söderblom]] on October 29, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=4293948.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4293948&amp;RS=PN/4293948  Data transmission system], Olof Soderblom, PN 4,293,948, October 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; And a paper on the [[Ethernet]] protocol was published by [[Robert Metcalfe]] and [[David Boggs]] in the July 1976 issue of ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks], Robert M. Metcalfe and David R. Boggs, Communications of the ACM (pp. 395-404, Vol. 19, No. 5), July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet access]] became widespread late in the century, using the old telephone and television networks.
