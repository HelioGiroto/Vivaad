[[File:Gustave dore crusades the childrens crusade.jpg|thumb|''The Children's Crusade'', by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

The '''Children's Crusade''' is the name given to a disastrous [[Crusade]] by European Catholics to expel Muslims from the [[Holy Land]] said to have taken place in 1212. The traditional narrative is probably conflated from some factual and mythical notions of the period including visions by a French or German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the [[Holy Land]] to Christianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold into slavery. A study published in 1977 cast doubt on the existence of these events, and many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children but multiple bands of &quot;wandering poor&quot; in Germany and France, some of whom tried to reach the Holy Land and others who never intended to do so. Early versions of events, of which there are many variations told over the centuries, are largely [[apocryphal]] {{what?|date=October 2012}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Raedts | first = P | title = The Children's Crusade of 1213 | journal = Journal of Medieval History | volume = 3 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;russel&quot;&gt;Russell, Oswald, &quot;Children's Crusade&quot;, ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version of events==
===Traditional===
The variants of the long-standing story of the Children's Crusade have similar themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;russel&quot;/&gt; A boy began preaching in either France or Germany claiming that he had been visited by Jesus and told to lead a [[Crusade]] to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of supposed portents and miracles he gained a considerable following, including possibly as many as 30,000&amp;nbsp;children. He led his followers south towards the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the belief that the sea would part on their arrival, allowing him and his followers to march to [[Jerusalem]], but this did not happen. Two merchants gave free passage on boats to as many of the children as were willing, but they were actually either taken to Tunisia and sold into slavery, or died in a shipwreck on [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] during a gale.  Some may have failed to reach the sea, dying or giving up from [[starvation]] and exhaustion.

===Modern===
According to more recent research there seem to have actually been two movements of people (of all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;russel&quot;/&gt; The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.

In the first movement, Nicholas, a shepherd from the Rhineland in Germany&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;&gt;Bridge, Antony. ''The Crusades''. London: Granada Publishing, 1980. ISBN 0-531-09872-9&lt;/ref&gt; who possessed an extraordinary power of speech, tried to lead a group across the [[Alps]] and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas promised that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the Saracens, he said that the Muslim kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt; His disciples went off to preach the call for the &quot;Crusade&quot; across the German lands, and they massed in [[Cologne]] after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on this ghastly journey died, while many others returned to their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt; About 7,000 arrived in [[Genoa]] in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genoese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt; Nicholas refused to admit defeat and traveled to [[Pisa]], his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the [[Papal States]], where Pope [[Innocent III]] treated them kindly enough. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the Pontiff told them to be good and return home. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt;

Some of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to [[Ancona]] and [[Brindisi]]; none reached the Holy Land.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt;

The second movement was led by a twelve-year-old&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt; French shepherd boy named Stephan of [[Cloyes-sur-le-Loir|Cloyes]], who claimed in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where he was seen to cause miracles. On the orders of [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], advised by the [[University of Paris]], the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephan, however, was not dissuaded, and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephan traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt; Still, few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.

At the end of June 1212, Stephan led his largely juvenile Crusaders from [[Vendôme]] to [[Marseilles]]. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge1980&quot;/&gt;

==Modern explanation==
{{Crusade}}
Recent research suggests {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} the participants were not children, at least not the very young. The confusion started because later chroniclers, who were not witness to the events of 1212 and who were writing 30 years or more later, began to translate the original accounts and understood the Latin word ''pueri'', meaning &quot;boys&quot;, to mean literally &quot;children&quot;. The original accounts did use the term ''pueri'', but it had a derogatory slang meaning, as in present-day calling an adult man a &quot;boy&quot; to be condescending.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wiktionary]] entry for [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boy#Noun Boy&quot;], definition No. 5, &quot;A lower-class or disreputable man; a worthless person&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 13th century, bands of wandering poor started cropping up throughout Europe; these were people displaced by economic changes at the time which forced many peasants in northern France and Germany to sell their land—they were often referred to condescendingly as ''pueri''. This mistaken literal interpretation of ''pueri'' as &quot;children&quot; gave rise to the idea of a &quot;Children's Crusade&quot; by later authors who found the story too good not to be true, particularly with so much public support and interest in crusading. Within a generation or two after 1212, the idea of children going on crusade became ingrained in history, retold countless times over the centuries with many different versions, and only in the 20th century has the myth been re-examined by looking at the earliest sources (see [[#Historical_studies|Historical studies]] below).

==Historiography==
===Sources===
According to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the [[Radboud University of Nijmegen]], there are only about 50&amp;nbsp;sources from the period that talk about the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page.&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;/&gt; Raedts categorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were written:&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;/&gt;
#Contemporary sources written by 1220;
#Sources written between 1220 and 1250 (the authors could have been alive at the time of the crusade but wrote their memories down later);
#Sources written after 1250 by authors who received their information second or third hand.

Raedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of those before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only in the later non-authoritative narratives that a &quot;children's crusade&quot; is implied by such authors as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Thomas of Cantimpré]], [[Matthew Paris]] and many others.

===Historical studies===
Prior to Raedts' 1977 study, there had only been a few historical publications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by Frenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and German [[Reinhold Röhricht|R. Röhricht]] (1876). They analyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist [[Dana Carleton Munro]] (1913–14), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of the sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly sober account of the Crusade sans legends.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, D. C. (1913–14). &quot;The Children's Crusade&quot;. ''American Historical Review''. 19:516–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, J. E. Hansbery (1938–9) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been discredited as based on an unreliable source.&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;/&gt; German psychiatrist [[Justus Hecker]] (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a polemic about &quot;diseased religious emotionalism&quot; that has since been discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;raedts&quot;/&gt;

P. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an article, which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the Innocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave themselves up for the good of [[Christendom]]; however he based his ideas on some of the most untrustworthy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Alphandery, P. (1954). ''La Chrétienté et l'idée de croisade''. 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric piety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war.&lt;ref&gt;Waas, A. (1956). ''Geschichte der Kreuzzüge''&lt;/ref&gt; H. E. Mayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying children were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest, recognizing the cult of poverty he said that &quot;the Children's Crusade marked both the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, H.E. (1972). ''The Crusades''&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Miccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not portray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined all other interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Miccoli, G. (1961). &quot;La crociata dei fancifulli&quot;. ''Studi medievali''. Third Series, 2:407–43&lt;/ref&gt; except perhaps that of [[Norman Cohn]] (1971) who saw it as a [[chiliastic]] movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, N. (1971). ''The pursuit of the millennium''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Raedts' 1977 analysis is considered the best source to date to show the many issues surrounding the Children's Crusade.&lt;ref name=&quot;russel&quot;/&gt;

===Popular accounts===
Beyond the scientific studies there are many popular versions and theories about the Children's Crusades. Norman Zacour in the survey ''A History of the Crusades'' (1962) generally follows Munro's conclusions, and adds that there was a psychological instability of the age, concluding the Children's Crusade &quot;remains one of a series of social explosions, through which medieval men and women—and children too—found release&quot;.

[[Steven Runciman]] gives an account of the Children's Crusade in his ''A History of the Crusades''.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, Steven (1951). [http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/children.html &quot;The Children's Crusade&quot;], from ''A History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt; Raedts notes that &quot;Although he cites Munro's article in his notes, his narrative is so wild that even the unsophisticated reader might wonder if he had really understood it.&quot; [[Donald Spoto]], in a book about Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], said monks were motivated to call them children, and not wandering poor, because being poor was considered pious and the Church was embarrassed by its wealth in contrast to the poor. This, according to Spoto, began a literary tradition from which the popular legend of children originated. This idea closely follows H. E. Mayer.
