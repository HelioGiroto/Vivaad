{{History of Turkey}}
The '''history of Turkey''' begins with the migration of [[Oghuz Turks]]&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'' (Morrow Quill Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Anatolia]] in the context of the larger [[Turkic expansion]], forming the [[Seljuq Empire]] in the 11th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Seljuq victory over forces of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1071 at the [[Battle of Manzikert]],&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; the process was accelerated and the country was referred to as 'Turchia' in the Europe as early as the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James Bainbridge |url=http://books.google.com.tr/books?id=Kz5A0r9Mi5UC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=the+country+was+referred+to+turchia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tDbNkZPREA&amp;sig=jsbcbhqx1NQoNhST45J58TvxIZw&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=i0hxTPSSMsmnOIvr-bAL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%2buttoxy%20was%20referred%20to%20turchia&amp;f=false |title=Turkey (Country Guide) |edition=11| publisher=Lonely Planet |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seljuq dynasty controlled Turkey until the country was invaded by the [[Mongols]] following the [[Battle of Kosedag]]. During the years when the country was under Mongol rule, some small Turkish states were born. One of these states was the Ottoman beylik which quickly controlled Western Anatolia and conquered much of [[Rumelia]]. After finally conquering Istanbul, the Ottoman state would become a large empire, called the Turkish Empire in Europe. Next, the Empire expanded to [[Eastern Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. Although the Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th century; it did not fully reach the technological advance in military capabilities of the Western powers in the 19th century. Nevertheless, Turkey managed to maintain independence though some of its territories were ceded to its neighbours and some small countries gained independence from it. Following [[World War I]] in which Turkey was defeated, most of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace was occupied by the Allied powers including the capital city [[Istanbul]]. In order to resist the occupation, a cadre of young military officers formed a government in [[Ankara]]. The elected leader of the [[Ankara Government]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] organized a successful [[Turkish War of Independence|war of independence]] against the Allied powers. After the liberation of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Eastern Thrace]], the [[Republic of Turkey]] was established in 1923 with capital city Ankara.

==Turkic migration==
{{Further|Turkic migration|History of Anatolia|History of the Turkic peoples}}
Before the Turkic settlement, the local population of [[Anatolia]] had reached an estimated level of 12 to 14 million people during the late Roman Period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3596052 Late Medieval Balkan and Asia Minor Population.Josiah C. Russell.Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Oct., 1960), pp. 265-274]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/280733 Estimating Population at Ancient Military Sites: The Use of Historical and Contemporary Analogy. P. Nick Kardulias. American Antiquity, Vol. 57, No. 2 (Apr., 1992), pp. 276-287]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Russell, Late Ancient And Medieval Population, published as vol. 48 pt. 3 of the Transactions Of The American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkic migration|migration]] of Turks to the country of modern Turkey occurred during the main [[Turkic migration]] across most of [[Central Asia]] and into [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] which was between the 6th and 11th centuries. Mainly Turkic people living in the [[Seljuk Empire]] arrived Turkey in the eleventh century. The Seljuks proceeded to gradually conquer the Anatolian part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the following centuries, the local population began to be assimilated into the Turkish people. More Turkic migrants began to intermingle with the local inhabitants over years, thus the Turkish-speaking population was bolstered.

==Seljuk dynasty==
{{Main|Turkic migration|Seljuk Empire|Sultanate of Rûm}}

[[File:131 Bataille de Malazgirt.jpg|190px|left|thumb|[[Battle of Manzikert]]]]
[[File:Europe map 1092.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Great Seljuk Empire (dark green) and neighboring states]]

The ''House of Seljuk'' was a branch of the ''Kınık'' [[Oghuz Turks|Oğuz Turks]] who resided on the periphery of the [[Muslim history#Abbasids - &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot;|Muslim world]], north of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea]]s in the Yabghu [[Khagan]]ate of the Oğuz confederacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al Hind: The Making of the Indo Islamic World, Vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, 7th–11th Centuries|first=Andre|last=Wink|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=1990|isbn=90-04-09249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 10th century. In the 11th century, the Turkic people living in the Seljuk Empire started migrating from their ancestral homelands towards the eastern regions of Anatolia, which eventually became a new homeland of Oğuz Turkic tribes following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] on August 26, 1071.

The victory of the Seljuks gave rise to the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]], a separate branch of the larger [[Seljuk Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|first=Cyril|last=Mango|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=2002|isbn=0-19-814098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to some Turkish principalities (beyliks), mostly situated towards the Eastern Anatolia which were vassals of or at war with Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.

==Mongol rule==
[[File:IlkhanidHorseArcher.jpg|thumb|right|A Ilkanid horse archer in the 13th century]]
{{Main|Mongol Empire|Ilkhanate}}

On June 26, 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the [[Battle of Kosedag]], and the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm became a vassal of the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the Seljuks to lose its power. [[Hulegu Khan]], grandson of [[Genghis Khan]] founded the Ilkhanate in the southwestern part of the Mongol Empire. The Ilkhanate State ruled Anatolia by Mongol military governors. The last Seljuk sultan [[Mesud II]], died in 1308. The Mongol invasion of Transoxiana, Iran, Azerbaijan and Anatolia caused Turkomens to move to Western Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik5.html |title=Halil Inalcik. &quot;The Question of the Emergence of the Ottoman State&quot; |author=Halil Inalcık |date= |work= |publisher=h-net.org |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkomens founded some Anatolian principalities (beyliks) under the Mongol dominion in Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyliks&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of world historyEmpire|first=Peter N.|last=Stearns|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Country|year=2001|isbn=0-688-03093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful beyliks were the [[Karamanids]] and the [[Germiyanids]] in the central area. Along the Aegean coast, from north to south, stretched [[Karasids]], [[Sarukhanids]], [[Aydinids]], [[Menteşe]] and [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]] principalities. The [[Jandarids]] (later called [[Isfendiyarids]]) controlled the [[Black Sea]] region round [[Kastamonu]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Cbj2G4l7elYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;ots=a1AhurHzHu&amp;dq=beylik&amp;output=html&amp;sig=VTuPvTM8SoOXkXeMsWFIc69Z8k8&amp;hl=en (limited preview)] {{Cite book| title = European and Islamic Trade in the Early Ottoman State: The Merchants of Genoa and Turkey ISBN 0-521-64221-3 |author= Kate Fleet |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beylik of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Dynasty was situated in the northwest of Anatolia, around [[Söğüt]], and it was a small and insignificant state at that time. The Ottoman beylik would, however, evolve into the [[Ottoman Empire]] over the next 200 years, expanding throughout the [[Balkans]], [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottomans&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire|first=Patrick|last=Kinross|publisher=Morrow|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman dynasty==
[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Mehmed II enters Constantinople by [[Fausto Zonaro]]]]

{{Main|Ottoman Empire|Ottoman territories in Europe}}
The Ottoman beylik's first capital was located in [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] in 1326. Edirne which was conquered in 1361&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Empire: conquest, organization and economy|first=Halil|last=Inalcık|publisher=Variorum ReprintsPress|year=1978|isbn=0-86078-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the next capital city. After largely expanding to Europe and Anatolia, in 1453, the Ottomans nearly completed the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, [[Constantinople]] during the reign of [[Mehmed II]]. This city has become the capital city of the Empire following Edirne. The Ottoman Empire would continue to expand into the Eastern Anatolia, Central Europe, the Caucasus, North and East Africa, the islands in the Mediterranean, Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

[[File:Semailname 47b.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The sultan of the golden age, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].]]

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The empire was often at odds with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its steady advance towards [[Central Europe]] through the Balkans and the southern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|first=Stanford|last=Jay Shaw|coauthors=Kural Shaw, Ezel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Ottomans were often at war with Persia over territorial disputes. At sea, the empire contended with the Holy Leagues, composed of [[Habsburg Spain]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Knights of St. John]], for control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]], the Ottoman navy frequently confronted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fleets in order to defend its traditional monopoly over the maritime trade routes between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]]; these routes faced new competition with the Portuguese discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488.

The Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 marked the beginning of the Ottoman decline; some territories were lost by the treaty: Austria received all of Hungary and Transylvania except the Banat; Venice obtained most of Dalmatia along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula in southern Greece); Poland recovered Podolia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire continued losing its territories, including [[Greece]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and the [[Balkans]] in the 1912–1913 [[Balkan Wars]]. Faced with territorial losses on all sides the Ottoman Empire forged an alliance with Germany who supported it with troops and equipment. The Ottoman Empire joined the [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], after granting two German warships as refugees.

On October 30, 1918, the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed, followed by the imposition of [[Treaty of Sèvres]] on August 10, 1920 by [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], which was never ratified. The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] would break up the Ottoman Empire and force large concessions on territories of the Empire in favour of [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France.

==Republican era==
{{Main|History of the Republic of Turkey|Atatürk's reforms}}

[[File:Portrait of M. Kemal Ataturk.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]]]

The occupation of some parts of the country by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot;/&gt; Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atatürk&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ataturk|first=Andrew|last=Mango|publisher=Overlook|
year=2000|isbn=1-58567-011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 18, 1922, the occupying armies were expelled. On November 1, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|newly founded parliament]] formally abolished the [[Sultan]]ate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of July 24, 1923, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed &quot;Republic of Turkey&quot; as the [[successor state]] of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923, in the new capital of [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot; /&gt; Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of Turkey]] and subsequently introduced [[Atatürk's Reforms|many radical reforms]] with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot; /&gt; According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific surname &quot;Atatürk&quot; (''Father of the Turks'') in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atatürk&quot; /&gt;

Turkey remained neutral during most of [[World War II]] but entered on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on February 23, 1945, as a ceremonial gesture and in 1945 became a charter member of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey_UN&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Overview/growth.htm|title=Growth in United Nations membership (1945–2005)|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2006-10-30|date=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties faced by [[Greece]] after the war in quelling a [[Greek Civil War|communist rebellion]], along with demands by the [[Soviet Union]] for military bases in the [[Turkish Straits]], prompted the United States to declare the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in large-scale [[Turkey-United States relations|U.S. military and economic support]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman Doctrine&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outposts and Allies: U.S. Army Logistics in the Cold War, 1945–1953|first=James A.|last=Huston|publisher=Susquehanna University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-941664-84-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ID4E3Lm8TsgC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=turkey+cold+war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After participating with the United Nations forces in the [[Korean War]], Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]. Following a decade of [[Cypriot Civil War|intercommunal violence]] on the island of [[Cyprus]] and the [[EOKA-B|Greek military coup of July 1974]], overthrowing President [[Makarios III|Makarios]] and installing [[Nikos Sampson]] as a dictator, Turkey [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded the Republic of Cyprus]] in 1974. Nine years later the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC) was established.

The [[Single-Party Period of Republic of Turkey|single-party period]] was followed by [[Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey|multiparty democracy]] after 1945. The Turkish democracy was interrupted by military [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] in [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960]], [[1971 Turkish coup d'état|1971]], [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980]] and [[1997 military memorandum (Turkey)|1997]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TRPoliticsandMilitary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish Politics and the Military|first=William Mathew|last=Hale|publisher=Routledge, UK|year=1994|isbn=0-415-02455-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] began an insurgency against the Turkish government; the conflict, which has claimed over 40,000 lives, continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8352934.stm|title=Turkey's PKK peace plan delayed|work=BBC|accessdate=2010-02-06|date=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the liberalization of the Turkish economy during the 1980s, the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater political stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;80sLiberalization&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics and Politics of Turkish Liberalization|first=Tevfik F.|last=Nas|publisher=Lehigh University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-934223-19-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
