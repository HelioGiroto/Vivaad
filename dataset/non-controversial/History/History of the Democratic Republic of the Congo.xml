{{Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

==Early Congolese history==
[[File:Mercator Congo map.jpg|200px|thumb|left|map of the Kingdom of Kongo]]
{{main|Early Congolese history}}
The area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at Katanda, one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, and which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/g36v03001423n142/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1960 the [[Ishango bone]] tool was discovered, fashioned from the fibula of a baboon  with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a [[tally stick]], as it has a series of what has been interpreted as [[tally marks]] carved in three columns running the length of the tool, but some scientists have suggested that the groupings of notches indicate a mathematical understanding that goes beyond counting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] [[University of Western Australia]] School of Mathematics - accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old.&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks,  A.S. and Smith, C.C. (1987): &quot;Ishango revisited: new age determinations and cultural interpretations&quot;, ''The African Archaeological Review'', 5 : 65-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congo was settled in the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. by [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] from present-day [[Nigeria]]. During its history the area has also been known as ''Congo'', ''Congo Free State'', ''Belgian Congo'' and ''Zaire''. The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was a powerful kingdom that existed from the 14th to the 18th century. It was the dominant force in the region until the arrival of the Portuguese. Second in importance was the [[Anziku Kingdom]].

==European colonization==
===Congo Free State (1885&amp;ndash;1908)===
{{main|Congo Free State}}
[[Image:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Children mutilated during King Leopold II's rule]]
The Congo Free State was a [[corporate state]] privately controlled by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II, King of the Belgians]] through the ''[[Association Internationale Africaine]]'', a non-governmental organization. Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman. The state included the entire area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
Under Leopold II's administration, the Congo Free State became the site of one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century. The report of the British Consul [[Roger Casement]] led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903, including one [[Belgium|Belgian]] national for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives. Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. In the absence of a census, the first was made in 1924, it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Roger Casement's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people. According to Casement's report, indiscriminate &quot;war&quot;, starvation, reduction of births and [[tropical diseases]] caused the country's depopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urome.be/fr2/reflexions/casemrepo.pdf Report of the British Consul, Roger Casement, on the Administration of the Congo Free State]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900. By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure led Leopold II to the annex the Congo as the [[Belgian Congo]] colony.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Belgian Congo (1908&amp;ndash;1960)===
{{main|Belgian Congo}}
On 15 November 1908 [[Léopold II of Belgium|King Léopold II of Belgium]] formally relinquished personal control of the ''Congo Free State''. The renamed '''Belgian Congo''' came under the administration of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] parliament, which lasted until independence was granted in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The Belgian administration might be most charitably characterized as [[paternalistic]] [[colonialism]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] churches dominated the education system and the curricula reflected [[Christianity|Christian]] and Western values. In 1948 Christian missions controlled 99.6% of educational facilities. They had little regard for native culture and beliefs. Native schools provided a mainly religious and vocational education.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==The Congo Crisis (1960&amp;ndash;1965)==
{{main|Congo Crisis}}
Following riots in Leopoldville between 4–7 January 1959, and Stanleyville on 31 October 1959, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence. The Belgians and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960. At the end of the Conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960, and full independence granted on 30 June 1960. The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960, adopting the name &quot;[[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]&quot; (République du Congo).  As the French colony of [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]] (Moyen Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon receiving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]] and [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], after their capital cities. President [[Mobutu]] changed the country's official name to Zaire in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1960, the country was in a very unstable state—regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government—and with the departure of the Belgian administrators, there were almost no skilled bureaucrats left in the country. The first Congolese university graduate was only in 1956, and virtually no one in the new nation had any idea of how to manage a country of such size.

[[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|Parliamentary elections in 1960]] produced the nationalist [[Patrice Lumumba]] as prime minister and pro-[[Western world|Western]] [[Joseph Kasavubu]] as president of the renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Even from this fleeting moment of independence democracy began to unravel. On 5 July 1960 a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country, [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], seceded under [[Moise Tshombe]]. The [[United Nations]] sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this same period Congo's second richest province, [[South Kasai|Kasai]], also announced its independence on 8 August 1960.

Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] for assistance. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The [[United States]] viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. On 14 September 1960, with U.S. and [[CIA]] support, Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba. 

On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to Élisabethville (now [[Lubumbashi]]), capital of Katanga. In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches. For the next three weeks, he was not seen or heard from. Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by some villagers. In fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival. It was soon clear that he had been murdered in custody. In 2001, a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers, under Katangan command. Lumumba was beaten, placed in front of a firing squad with 2 other allies, cut up, buried, dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid.&lt;ref&gt;De Witte, Ludo: ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under [[Antoine Gizenga]] which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961. After some reverses, UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of [[South Kasai]] on 30 December 1961, and [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] on 15 January 1963.

A new crisis erupted in the [[Simba Rebellion]] of 1964-1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels. European mercenaries, US, and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion.

==Zaire (1965&amp;ndash;1996)==
{{main|Zaire}}
[[File:Mobutu.jpg|200px|thumb|Mobutu Sese Seko]]
Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Mobutu, by then commander in chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years. Mobutu quickly consolidated his power and was elected unopposed as president in 1970. Embarking on a campaign of cultural awareness, Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire and required citizens to adopt African names. Relative peace and stability prevailed until 1977 and 1978 when Katangan rebels, based in [[Angola]], launched a series of invasions ([[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]]) into the Shaba (Katanga) region. The rebels were driven out with the aid of Belgian paratroopers.

Zaire remained a one-party state in the 1980s. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the [[Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social]] (UDPS), were active. Mobutu's attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As the Cold War came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime's human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his massive embezzlement of government funds for personal use. 

In April 1990, Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of a reform package were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting [[Kinshasa]] to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on [[U.S. Air Force]] planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised [[Sovereign National Conference]] was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop [[Laurent Monsengwo]] as its chairman, along with [[Étienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba]], leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the [[High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition]] (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and [[Kengo Wa Dondo]] as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next two years, they never took place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==First and Second Congo Wars (1996&amp;ndash;2003)==
{{main|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}
By 1996, tensions from the neighboring [[Rwanda]] war and [[genocide]] had spilled over to [[Zaire]]: ''see [[History of Rwanda]]''. Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate its massacres in November 1996, the Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu. 

The Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by [[Laurent-Desire Kabila]], became known as the [[Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre]] (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country, and Kabila marched unopposed to Kinshasa on 20 May. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Kabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country, and lost his allies. [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by the warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]], attacked in August 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Soon afterwards, Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe  became involved militarily in the Congo, with Angola and Zimbabwe supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. Kabila was assassinated in January 2001 by one of his bodyguards, and was succeeded by his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]]. Upon taking office, Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. He partly succeeded in February 2001 when a further peace deal was brokered between Kabila, Rwanda and Uganda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops. UN peacekeepers, [[MONUC]], arrived in April 2001.

Currently the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a {{convert|200|mi|km|sing=on}} wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie]] (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country, including [[diamond]]s, [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[coltan]]. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders, held in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], lasted a full six weeks, beginning in April 2002. In June, they signed a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003, all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo.

==Transitional government (2003&amp;ndash;2006)==
{{main|Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006}}
DR Congo had a [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] in July 2003 until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first multi-party elections]] since independence in 1960. After this [[Joseph Kabila]] took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parts from  20–22 August 2006 in the streets of the capital, [[Kinshasa]]. Sixteen people died before policemen and UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote. Bemba has publicly commented on election &quot;irregularities,&quot; despite the fact that every neutral observer has praised the elections. On 6 December 2006 the Transitional Government came to an end as Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President.

==Significant conflicts==
The fragility of the state has allowed continued violence and human rights abuses in the east. There are three significant centers of conflict:

#North and South Kivu, where [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the [[Banyamulenge]], and where Rwanda supports [[RCD-Goma]] rebels against Kinshasa (see [[Kivu war]]).
#[[Ituri Province|Ituri]], where MONUC has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the [[Ituri conflict]]
#Northern [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], where [[Mai-Mai]] created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa.

In October 2009 [[Dongo conflict|a new conflict]] started in [[Dongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dongo]], [[Sud-Ubangi District]] where clashes had broken out over access to fishing ponds.

==Re-election of Joseph Kabila==
On December 2011, [[Joseph Kabila]] was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and [[Mbuji-Mayi]], where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate [[Etienne Tshisekedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR Congo election: Questions hang over Kabila's victory|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16128729|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official observers from the [[Carter Center]] reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carter Center: DRC Presidential Election Results Lack Credibility (press release)|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/drc-121011.html|newspaper=Carter Center|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to &quot;swear himself in&quot; as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR Congo President Joseph Kabila begins second term|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16261907|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
