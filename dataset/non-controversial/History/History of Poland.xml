      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="132526">{{History of Poland}}
The '''History of [[Poland]]''' is rooted in the [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages|arrival of the Slavs]], who gave rise to permanent settlement and historic development on Polish lands. During the [[Piast dynasty]] [[Western Christianity|Christianity]] [[Baptism of Poland|was adopted]] in 966 and [[High Middle Ages|medieval monarchy]] established. The [[Jagiellon dynasty]] period brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Renaissance in Poland|cultural development]] and territorial expansion, culminating in the establishment of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569.

The Commonwealth in its early phase constituted a continuation of the Jagiellon prosperity, with its remarkable development of a sophisticated noble democracy. From the mid-17th century, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and  [[Golden Liberty|deterioration of the country's system of government]]. Significant [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|internal reforms]] were introduced during the later part of the 18th century, but the reform process was not allowed to run its course, as the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] terminated the Commonwealth's independent existence in 1795.

From then until 1918 there was no independent Polish state. The Poles had engaged intermittently in armed resistance until 1864. After the failure of the [[January Uprising|last uprising]], the nation preserved its identity through educational uplift and the program called &quot;[[organic work]]&quot; to modernize the economy and society. The opportunity for freedom appeared only after [[World War I]], when the partitioning imperial powers were defeated by war and revolution.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] was established and existed from 1918 to 1939. It was destroyed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] by their [[Invasion of Poland]] at the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens perished in the course of the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi occupation]]. The [[Polish government in exile]] kept functioning and through the many Polish military formations on the [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] and [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] fronts the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory. Nazi Germany's forces were compelled to retreat from Poland as the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced, which led to the creation of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].

The country's [[territorial changes of Poland|geographic location was shifted to the west]] and Poland existed as a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Poland largely lost its traditional [[ethnic group|multi-ethnic]] character and the [[communism|communist]] system was imposed. By the late 1980s [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], a Polish reform movement, became crucial in causing a peaceful transition from a [[communist state]] to the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|modern Polish state]].

==Prehistory and protohistory==
{{Further2|[[Prehistory and protohistory of Poland]]}}

[[homo|Humans]] have lived in the [[glacial period|glaciation]] disrupted environment of north [[Central Europe]] for a long time. In [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over the period of at least 800,000 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;The oldest human traces north of the Carpathians&quot;/&gt; the area of present-day Poland went through the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] stages of development, along with the nearby regions. Settled agricultural people have lived there for the past 7500 years, since their first arrival at the outset of the [[Neolithic]] period. Following the earlier [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman influence]] [[archaeological culture|cultures]], the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people have been in this territory for over 1500 years. They organized first into [[Polish tribes|tribal units]], and then combined into larger [[political system|political structure]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;UzP 122-167&quot;/&gt;

==Piast dynasty==
{{Further2|[[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty]]}}

[[Image:Polska 992 - 1025.png|190px|thumb|right|Poland expanded under its first two rulers. Dark pink area represents Poland at end of rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (992); light pink area added (northwest lost) during reign of [[Bolesław I the Brave|Bolesław I]] (died 1025).]]

During the [[Piast dynasty]] rule (10th–14th century), Poland was formed and established as a state and a nation. The historically recorded Polish state begins with the rule of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] in the second half of the 10th century. Mieszko chose to be [[Baptism of Poland|baptized]] in the Western [[Latin Rite]] in 966. Mieszko completed the unification of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribal lands fundamental to the new country's existence. Following its emergence, the [[Poles|Polish nation]] was led by [[List of Polish monarchs|a series of rulers]] who converted the population to [[Christianity]], created [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|a strong kingdom]] and [[culture of medieval Poland|integrated Poland into the European culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyrozumski 1-177&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Władysław I sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|left|175 px|[[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]]]
Mieszko's son [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] established a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Polish Church province]], pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025, becoming the first [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|King of Poland]]. This was followed by a collapse of the monarchy and restoration under [[Casimir I the Restorer|Casimir I]]. Casimir's son [[Bolesław II the Bold]] became fatally involved in a conflict with the [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|ecclesiastical authority]], and was expelled from the country. After [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław III]] [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|divided the country among his sons]], internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchy structure in the 12th and 13th centuries. [[Konrad I of Masovia|One of the regional Piast dukes]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans, which caused centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and then with the [[Duchy of Prussia|German Prussian state]]. The Kingdom was restored under [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]], strengthened and expanded by his son [[Casimir III the Great]]. The western provinces of [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]] were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for, after the reigns of two [[Louis I of Hungary|members]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin dynasty]], the new powerful [[Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] that was to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyrozumski 1-177&quot;/&gt;

Beginning with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duke]] [[Jogaila]] (Władysław II Jagiełło), the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] (1386–1572) formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. The partnership brought vast [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]-controlled [[Ruthenia|Rus' areas]] into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and [[Lithuanians]], who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest [[personal union|political entities]] in Europe for the next four centuries. In the [[Baltic Sea]] region, Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and included the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (German: Battle of Tannenberg; Lithuanian: Battle of Žalgiris) (1410) and in 1466 the milestone [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Peace of Thorn]] under King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]; the treaty created the future [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In the south, Poland confronted the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]], and in the east helped Lithuania fight the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. Poland was developing as a [[feudalism|feudal]] state, with predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant [[landed nobility]] component. The ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act adopted by the Polish ''[[General sejm|Sejm]]'' ([[parliament]]) in 1505, transferred most of the [[legislature|legislative power]] from the [[monarch]] to the ''Sejm''. This event marked the beginning of the period known as &quot;[[Golden Liberty]]&quot;, when the state was ruled by the &quot;free and equal&quot; [[szlachta|Polish nobility]]. [[Protestant Reformation]] movements made deep inroads into the Polish Christianity, which resulted in unique at that time in Europe policies of [[religious toleration|religious tolerance]]. The European [[Renaissance]] currents evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]) an immense [[Renaissance in Poland|cultural flowering]]. Poland's and Lithuania's territorial expansion included the far north region of [[Livonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Wyrozumski – ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), p. 178-250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Andrzej Gierowski]] – ''Historia Polski 1505–1764'' (History of Poland 1505–1764), Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Polish Scientific Publishers PWN), Warszawa 1986, ISBN 83-01-03732-6, p. 1-105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rzeczpospolita 1600.png|300 px|thumb|right|The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent, after the [[Truce of Deulino]] (Dywilino) of 1619]]

The [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569 established the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a more closely unified federal state. The Union was largely run by the nobility, through the system of the [[general sejm|central parliament]] and [[sejmik|local assemblies]], but led by [[elective monarchy|elected kings]]. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility constituted an early democratic system (&quot;a sophisticated noble democracy&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 176-177&quot;/&gt; in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe 555&quot;/&gt; The beginning of the Commonwealth coincided with the period of Poland's great power, civilizational advancement and prosperity. The Polish–Lithuanian Union had become an influential player in Europe and a vital cultural entity, [[Polonization|spreading]] the [[Western culture]] eastward. In the second half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a huge state in central-eastern Europe, with an area approaching one million square kilometers. The [[Catholic Church]] embarked on an ideological counteroffensive and [[Counter-Reformation]] claimed many converts from Protestant circles. The [[Union of Brest]] split the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, assertive militarily under King [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]], suffered from dynastic distractions during the reigns of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]] kings [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] and [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]]. The Commonwealth fought wars with [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] and dealt with a series of [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings. Allied with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], it did not directly participate in the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1505–1764'' (History of Poland 1505–1764), p. 105-173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline (1648–1764)===
{{Further2|[[History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648–1764)]]}}
[[File:Sobieski z synem.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|King [[John III Sobieski]] with son [[James Louis Sobieski|Jakub]], whom he tried to position to be his successor. Sobieski led the Commonwealth to its [[Battle of Vienna|last victories]].]]

Beginning in the middle of the 17th century, the nobles' [[democracy]], subjected to devastating wars, falling into internal disorder and then [[anarchy]], gradually declined, making the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention. From 1648, the Cossack [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east, and was soon followed by a [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion]], which raged through core Polish lands. Warfare with the Cossacks and Russia left [[Ukraine]] divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]]'s dependency. [[John III Sobieski]], fighting protracted wars with the Ottoman Empire, revived the Commonwealth's military might once more, in process helping decisively in 1683 to [[Battle of Vienna|deliver Vienna]] from a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] onslaught. From there, it all went downhill. The Commonwealth, subjected to almost constant warfare until 1720, suffered enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy and social structure. The government became ineffective because of large scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski's Rokosz]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederation]]s), corrupted legislative processes and manipulation by foreign interests. The nobility class fell under control of a handful of powerful families with established territorial domains, the urban population and infrastructure fell into ruin, together with most peasant farms. The reigns of two kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], brought the Commonwealth further disintegration. The [[Great Northern War]], a period seen by the contemporaries as a passing eclipse, may have been the fatal blow destined to bring down the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Noble Republic]]. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] became a strong regional power and [[Silesian Wars|took Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The Commonwealth-Saxony [[personal union]] however gave rise to the emergence of the reform movement in the Commonwealth, and the beginnings of the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1505–1764'' (History of Poland 1505–1764), p. 174-301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms and loss of statehood (1764–1795)===
{{Further2|[[History of Poland (1569–1795)]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]}}
[[File:Oath of confirmation of Constitution of the 3rd May 1791.PNG|thumb|300 px|right|In 1791 the [[Great Sejm|Great or Four-Year Sejm]] adopted the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May 3 Constitution]] at [[Warsaw]]'s [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]]]]

During the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth attempted fundamental internal reforms. The reform activity provoked hostile reaction and eventually military response on the part of the neighboring powers. The second half of the century brought improved economy and significant growth of the population. The most populous capital city of [[Warsaw]] replaced [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk) as the leading trade center, and the role of the more prosperous urban strata was increasing. The last decades of the independent Commonwealth existence were characterized by intense reform movements and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The [[free election (Polish throne)|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to a major [[magnate]] [[Czartoryski family|faction]], but hand-picked and imposed by Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], who expected Poniatowski to be her obedient follower. The [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|King]] accordingly spent his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save the state, and his perceived necessity of remaining in subordinate relationship with his [[Russian Empire|Russian]] sponsors. The [[Bar Confederation]] of 1768 was a ''[[szlachta]]'' rebellion directed against Russia and the Polish king, fought to preserve Poland's independence and in support of ''szlachta'''s traditional causes. It was brought under control and followed in 1772 by the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]], a permanent encroachment on the outer Commonwealth provinces by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]]. The &quot;[[Partition Sejm]]&quot; under duress &quot;ratified&quot; the partition ''fait accompli'', but in 1773 also established the [[Commission of National Education]], a pioneering in Europe government education authority.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1764-1864'' (History of Poland 1764-1864), Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Polish Scientific Publishers PWN), Warszawa 1986, ISBN 83-01-03732-6, p. 1-74&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Smuglewicz Kosciuszko.jpg|300 px|thumb|left|[[Kościuszko Uprising]] began with [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] [[Kościuszko's proclamation|taking the oath]], [[Kraków]] 1794]]

The long-lasting ''[[general sejm|sejm]]'' convened by Stanisław August in 1788 is known as the [[Great Sejm|Great, or Four-Year Sejm]]. The ''sejm''{{'}}s landmark achievement was the passing of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May 3 Constitution]], the first in modern Europe singular pronouncement of a supreme law of the state. The reformist but moderate document, accused by detractors of [[French Revolution]] sympathies, soon generated strong opposition coming from the Commonwealth's upper nobility conservative circles and Catherine II, determined to prevent a rebirth of the strong Commonwealth. The nobility's [[Targowica Confederation]] appealed to the [[Catherine II of Russia|Empress]] for help and in May 1792 the Russian army entered the territory of the Commonwealth. The [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|defensive war fought by the forces of the Commonwealth]] ended when [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|the King]], convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated by joining the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation took over the government, but Russia and Prussia in 1793 arranged for and executed the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country with critically reduced territory, practically incapable of independent existence. The radicalized by the recent events reformers, in the still nominally Commonwealth area and in exile, were soon working on national insurrection preparations. [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] was chosen as its leader; the popular general came from abroad and on March 24, 1794 in [[Kraków|Cracow (Kraków)]] [[Kościuszko's proclamation|declared]] a [[Kościuszko Uprising|national uprising]] under his [[naczelnik|supreme command]]. Kościuszko emancipated and enrolled in his army many peasants, but the hard-fought insurrection, strongly supported also by urban plebeian masses, proved incapable of generating the necessary foreign collaboration and aid. It ended suppressed by the forces of Russia and Prussia, with Warsaw captured in November. The [[Third Partition of Poland|third and final partition of the Commonwealth]] was [[partitions of Poland|undertaken again by all three partitioning powers]], and in 1795 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1764-1864'' (History of Poland 1764-1864), p. 74-101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partitioned Poland ==

=== Armed resistance (1795–1864) ===
{{Further2|[[History of Poland (1795–1918)]]}}
[[File:Partitions of Poland.png|thumb|right|300px|The three [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1772, 1793, and 1795)]]

While there was no separate Polish state at all, the idea of Polish independence was kept alive throughout the 19th century and led to more Polish uprisings and other warfare against the partitioning powers. Military efforts after the Partitions were first based on Polish alliances with [[French Revolution|post-revolutionary France]]. [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski|Henryk Dąbrowski's]] [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]] fought in French campaigns outside of Poland, hoping that their involvement and contribution result in liberation of their Polish homeland. The Polish national anthem - [[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Dąbrowski's Mazurka]] - was written in praise of his actions by [[Józef Wybicki]] in 1797. The [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a small, semi-independent Polish state, was created in 1807 by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]], following his defeat of Prussia. The Duchy's military forces, led by [[Józef Antoni Poniatowski|Józef Poniatowski]], participated in numerous campaigns, including the [[Polish–Austrian War]] of 1809, the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812, and the [[German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)|German campaign]] of 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 102-181&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Death of Poniatowski.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|[[Józef Antoni Poniatowski|Józef Poniatowski]]'s leap into the [[Weisse Elster|Elster]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] to some epitomized Poland's fate]]

After the defeat of Napoleon, a new European order was established at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski|Adam Czartoryski]] became the leading advocate for the Polish national cause. The Congress implemented a new partition scheme, which took into account some of the gains realized by the Poles during the Napoleonic period. The Duchy of Warsaw was replaced with the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], a residual Polish state in [[personal union]] with the [[Russian Empire]], ruled by the [[Russian tsar]]. East of the Kingdom, large areas of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] remained [[Western Krai|directly incorporated]] into the Empire; together with the Kingdom they were part of the [[Russian partition]]. There was a [[Prussian partition]], with a portion of it separated as the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], and an [[Austrian partition]]. The newly created [[Free City of Kraków|Republic of Kraków]] was a tiny state under a joint supervision of the three partitioning powers. &quot;Partitions&quot; were the [[Administrative division of Polish–Lithuanian territories after partitions|lands of the former Commonwealth]], not actual administrative units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 102-181&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Chopin, by Wodzinska.JPG|thumb|175px|right|[[Frédéric Chopin]] wrote modern [[musical improvisation|improvisation]]-like piano pieces, many inspired by [[Music of Poland|Polish]] [[folk music]]]]

The increasingly repressive policies of the partitioning powers led to Polish conspiracies, and in 1830 to the [[November Uprising]] in the Kingdom. The uprising developed into a full-scale war with Russia, but the leadership was taken over by the Polish conservative circles reluctant to challenge the Empire, and hostile to broadening the independence movement's social base through measures such as [[land reform]]. Despite the significant resources mobilized and self-sacrifice of the participants, a series of missteps by several successive unwilling or incompetent chief commanders appointed by the Polish government ultimately led to the defeat of the insurgents by the Russian army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 181-231&quot;&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1764-1864'' (History of Poland 1764-1864), p. 181-231&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the November Uprising, thousands of former Polish combatants and other activists emigrated to Western Europe, where they were initially enthusiastically received. This element, known as the [[Great Emigration]], soon dominated the Polish political and intellectual life. Together with the leaders of the independence movement, the exile community included the greatest Polish literary and artistic minds, including the [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic]] poets [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Juliusz Słowacki]], [[Cyprian Norwid]], and composer [[Frédéric Chopin]]. In the occupied and repressed Poland, some sought progress through self-improvement activities known as [[organic work]]; others, in cooperation with emigrant circles, organized conspiracies and prepared for the next armed insurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 181-231&quot;/&gt;

The planned national uprising, after authorities in the partitions had found out about secret preparations, [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|ended in a fiasco]] in early 1846. In its most significant manifestation, the [[Kraków Uprising]] of February 1846, patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the Republic of Kraków into the Austrian partition. Austrian authorities took advantage of peasant discontent by inciting the villagers against noble-dominated insurgent units; it led to the [[Galician slaughter]], a violent anti-feudal rebellion, beyond the intended scope of the provocation. A new wave of Polish military and other involvement, in the partitions and in other parts of Europe, soon took place in the context of the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions. In particular, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|events in Berlin]] precipitated the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]], where peasants in Prussia, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 181-311&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Traugutt.jpg|thumb|175 px|left|[[Romuald Traugutt]], the last &quot;dictator&quot; of the [[January Uprising]]]]

A renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860-1861; during the large scale demonstrations in Warsaw the Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The &quot;Red&quot;, or left-wing conspiracy faction, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The &quot;White&quot;, or right-wing faction, inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities, countered with partial reform proposals. [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the Kingdom's government, in order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army, which hastened the outbreak of the hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelming enemy advantage. The warfare was limited to the Kingdom and lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864, when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the dedicated last supreme commander of the insurgence, was captured by the [[Russian Empire|tsarist]] police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski 181-311&quot;/&gt;

On March 2, 1864, the Russian authority — compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants — officially published an enfranchisement decree in the Kingdom, along the lines of an earlier insurgent land reform proclamation. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the capitalist system on central Polish lands. At the time when the futility of armed resistance without external support was realized by most Poles, the various segments of the Polish society were undergoing deep and far-reaching social, economic and cultural transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Andrzej Gierowski – ''Historia Polski 1764-1864'' (History of Poland 1764-1864), p. 311-345&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of modern Polish society under foreign rule (1864–1918)===

[[File:Maria Konopnicka001.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Maria Konopnicka]] was one of the authors representative of the socially engaged attitudes of [[Positivism in Poland|the times]]]]

Following the failure of the last of the national uprisings, the January Uprising of 1863, the Polish nation, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, preserved its identity in nonviolent ways. After the Uprising [[Congress Poland]], downgraded in official usage from the Kingdom of Poland to the [[Vistula Land]], was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The Russian and German languages were respectively imposed in all public communication and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. On the other hand the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region in western Ukraine and southern Poland, economically and socially backward, but under the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] rule increasingly allowed limited autonomy, experienced gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival. [[Positivism in Poland|Positivism]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 5&quot;/&gt;

&quot;[[Organic work]]&quot; social activities consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and worked on improving competitiveness of Polish-held business entities, industrial, agricultural, or other. New commercial methods and ways of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through trade associations and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made necessary business loans available. The other major area of organic work concern was education and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals reflected the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Buszko]] – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Polish Scientific Publishers PWN), Warszawa 1986, ISBN 83-01-03732-6, p. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic and social changes, such as land reform and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries old social structure of the Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business middle class, often originated from gentry alienated from their rural possessions (many smaller [[serfdom]]-based [[folwark|agricultural enterprises]] had not survived the land reforms)&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and from urban people. Industrial [[proletariat]], the new underprivileged class, were usually poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in countries of their origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various [[ethnic group|ethnic backgrounds]] worked or settled in Europe and in North and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 5&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Roman Dmowski.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|[[Roman Dmowski]] exerted strong ideological influence, but political power was to be monopolized by [[Józef Piłsudski]]]]

The changes were partial and gradual, and the degree of the fast-paced in some areas industrialization and capitalist development on Polish lands lagged behind the advanced regions of western Europe. The three partitions developed different economies, and were economically integrated with their mother states more than with each other. In the 1870s-1890s, large scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movements of great ideological fervor and corresponding political parties became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those ethnically Polish independence activists, who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth. Around the start of the 20th century the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered on Galicia and taking advantage of the conducive to liberal expression milieu there, was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 5&quot;/&gt;

The [[1905 Russian Revolution]] arose new waves of Polish unrest, political maneuvering, strikes and rebellion, with [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]] active as leaders of the [[National Democracy|nationalist]] and [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]] factions respectively. As the authorities reestablished control within the [[Russian Empire|Empire]], the revolt in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom]], placed under martial law, had withered as well, leaving tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Duma]]. Some of the acquired gains were however rolled back,&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; which coupled with intensified [[Germanisation|Germanization]] in the Prussian partition, left the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the most amenable to patriotic action territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 5&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Pilsudski in Otwock.jpg|thumb|left|325 px|&quot;The Commandant&quot;: [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]] with [[Polish Legions in World War I|his men]] in 1915]]

After the outbreak of [[World War I]], which confronted the partitioning powers against each other, Piłsudski's paramilitary units stationed in Galicia were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 6&quot;/&gt;

World War I and the political turbulence that was sweeping Europe in 1914 offered the Polish nation hopes for regaining independence. [[Poland during World War I|On the outbreak of war the Poles found themselves conscripted]] into the armies of Germany, Austria and Russia, and forced to fight each other in a war that was not theirs. Although many Poles sympathized with France and Britain, they found it hard to fight for their ally, Russia. They also had little sympathy for the Germans. Total [[World War I casualties|deaths]] from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within the 1919–1939 borders, were estimated at 1,128,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludność Polski w XX wieku (Population of Poland in the 20th Century)|last=[[Andrzej Gawryszewski]]|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|year= 2005|publisher=Polska Akademia Nauk ([[Polish Academy of Sciences]])|location=Warsaw|isbn= 83-87954-66-7|page=|pages=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I Poland had seen the defeat or retreat of all three partitioning powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 6&quot;/&gt;

During the course of the war the area of Congress Poland became occupied by the [[Central Powers]], with Warsaw captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915. In the [[Act of 5th November]] 1916, the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]] (''Królestwo Regencyjne'') was recreated by [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] on formerly Russian-controlled territory. This new [[puppet state]] existed until November 1918, when it was replaced by the newly established [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The independence of Poland had been campaigned for in the West by Dmowski and [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]]. With [[Fourteen Points|Woodrow Wilson's support]], Polish independence was officially endorsed in June 1918 by the [[Triple Entente|Entente Powers]], on whose fronts sizable [[Blue Army (Poland)|armies of Polish volunteers]] had been mobilized and fought. On the ground in Poland in October–November the final upsurge of the push for independence was taking place, with [[Ignacy Daszyński]] heading a short-lived Polish government in [[Lublin]] from November 6. [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] decided to withdraw its forces from Warsaw and released imprisoned Piłsudski, who arrived in Warsaw on November 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 6&quot;/&gt;

==Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)==

[[File:Polish-soviet war 1920 Polish defences near Milosna, August.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Polish–Soviet War]], [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|defenses near Warsaw]], August 1920]]

After more than a century of rule by its neighbors, [[Polish Independence Day|Poland regained its independence]] in 1918, internationally recognized in 1919 with the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and the Versailles treaty that followed resolved the issue of Poland's western border with Germany, including the [[Polish Corridor]], which gave Poland access to the [[Baltic Sea]], and the separate status of the [[Free City of Danzig]]. Plebiscites in [[East Prussian plebiscite|southern East Prussia]]&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 224, 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Upper Silesia]] were provided for, while the issues of other northern, eastern and southern borders remained undetermined, inviting military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121&quot;/&gt;

Of the several border-settling conflicts that ensued, the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919-1921 was the confrontation fought on a very large scale. Piłsudski had entertained far-reaching anti-Russian cooperative designs for Eastern Europe, and in 1919 the Polish forces pushed eastward into Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine (previously a theater of the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]]), taking advantage of the Russian preoccupation with the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]]. By June 1920, the Polish armies were past [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]] and (allied with the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]) [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|reached Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; but then the massive [[Bolshevik]] counteroffensive moved the Poles out of most of Ukraine and on the northern front arrived at the outskirts of Warsaw. The seemingly certain [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|disaster was averted]] in August by the combination of Piłsudski's military skills and a dedicated national defense effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Daszynski and Witos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Wincenty Witos]] (right) and [[Ignacy Daszyński]] headed a wartime cabinet in 1920. Witos was an [[Polish People's Party &quot;Piast&quot;|agrarian party]] leader and a centrist politician, later [[Brest trials|persecuted]] under the [[Sanation|Sanation regime]].]]

The Russian armies were separated, defeated and pushed back, which forced [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet]] leadership to abandon for the time being their strategic objective of linking up with the German and other European revolution-minded comrades (Lenin's hope of generating support for the [[Red Army]] in Poland had already failed to materialize). Piłsudski's seizure of Vilnius in October 1920 poisoned Polish–Lithuanian relations for the remainder of the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Piłsudski's planned East European federation of states (inspired by the tradition of the multiethnic &quot;[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Republic of Both Nations]]&quot; and including a hypothetical multinational successor state to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 60-65&quot;/&gt; was incompatible, at the time of rising national movements, with his assumption of Polish domination and with the encroachment on the neighboring peoples' lands and aspirations; as such it was doomed to failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prazmowska 164-172&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 225, 230, 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 57-60, 62&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} A larger federated structure was also opposed by Dmowski's [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].

[[File:Narutowicz death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Funeral of President [[Gabriel Narutowicz]]]] 

The [[Peace of Riga|Treaty of Riga]] of 1921 settled the eastern border, preserving for Poland, at the cost of partitioning the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuania and Belarus) and Ukraine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 63-69&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 147&quot;/&gt; a good portion of the old [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]'s eastern lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121&quot;/&gt; Ukrainians ended up with no state of their own and felt betrayed by the Riga arrangements; their resentment gave rise to extreme nationalism and anti-Polish hostility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 139-144&quot;/&gt; The [[Kresy|territories in the east]] won by 1921 would form the basis for a swap arranged and carried out by the Soviets in 1943-1945, who at that time [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|compensated]] the reemerging Polish state for its eastern lands lost to the Soviet Union with [[Recovered Territories|conquered areas of eastern Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121, 73-80&quot;/&gt;

The successful outcome of the Polish–Soviet War gave Poland a false sense of being a major and self-sufficient military power, and the government a justification for trying to resolve international problems through imposed unilateral solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prazmowska 164-172&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 232&quot;/&gt; The interwar period's Polish territorial and ethnic policies contributed to bad relations with most of Poland's neighbors and to uneasy cooperation with the more distant centers of power, including France, Britain and the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prazmowska 164-172&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukowski 232&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Piłsudski May 1926.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Piłsudski's [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 defined Poland's political reality for the years leading to [[World War II]]]]

The rapidly growing population of Poland within the new boundaries was ¾ agricultural and ¼ urban, with Polish being the primary language of ⅔ of the inhabitants. A [[March Constitution of Poland|constitution]] was adopted in 1921. Due to the insistence of the National Democrats, worried about the potential power of Piłsudski if elected, it introduced limited prerogatives for the presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 115-121&quot;/&gt;

What followed was the Second Republic's short (1921–1926) and turbulent period of constitutional order and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. The legislature remained fragmented and lacking stable majorities, governments changed frequently, corruption was commonplace. The open-minded [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was constitutionally elected president by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] in 1922, but deemed not pure enough by the nationalist right wing, was assassinated. Poland had suffered under a plethora of economic calamities, but there were also signs of progress and stabilization ([[Władysław Grabski]]'s economically competent government lasted for almost two years).&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt; The achievements of the democratic period, such as the establishment, strengthening or expansion of the various governmental and [[civil society]] structures and integrative processes necessary for normal functioning of the reunited state and nation, were too easily overlooked. Lurking on the sidelines was the disgusted army upper corps, not willing to subject itself to civilian control, but ready to follow its equally dissatisfied, at that time retired, [[Józef Piłsudski|legendary chief]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of Europe. A Short History of Poland'' by Norman Davies, p. 121-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rydz Smigly Bulawa1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|Last leaders of the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic]]: Marshal [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] and President [[Ignacy Mościcki]] in 1936]]

On May 12, 1926, Piłsudski, prompted by mutinous units seeking his leadership and intent on preventing the three-time prime minister [[Wincenty Witos]] of the peasant [[Polish People's Party]] from forming another coalition, staged a [[May Coup (Poland)|military overthrow of the Polish government]], confronting President [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and overpowering the troops loyal to him. Hundreds died in fratricidal fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;playground 312&quot;/&gt; Piłsudski was supported by several leftist factions, who ensured the success of his coup by blocking during the fighting the railway transportation of government forces, but the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] &quot;[[Sanation]]&quot; regime that he was to lead for the rest of his life and that stayed in power until [[World War II]], was neither leftist, nor overtly [[fascism|fascist]]. Political institutions and parties were allowed to function, which was combined with electoral manipulation and strong-arming of those not willing to cooperate into submission. Eventually persistent opponents of the regime, many of the leftist persuasion, were subjected to long [[Brest trials|staged trials]] and harsh sentences, or detained in [[Bereza Kartuska prison|camps for political prisoners]]. [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|Rebellious peasants]], striking industrial workers and nationalist Ukrainians became targets of ruthless military pacification, other minorities were harassed.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; Piłsudski, conscious of Poland's precarious international situation, signed non-aggression pacts with the [[Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|Soviet Union in 1932]] and with [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|Nazi Germany in 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of Europe.

The mainstream of the Polish society was not affected by the repressions of the Sanation authorities;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 126&quot;/&gt; many enjoyed the relative prosperity (the economy improved between 1926 and 1929)&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the government. Polish independence had boosted the development of [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|thriving culture]] and intellectual achievement was high, but the [[Great Depression]] brought huge unemployment and increased social tensions, including rising [[antisemitism]]. The reconstituted Polish state had had only 20 years of relative stability and uneasy peace [[interwar period|between the two wars]]. A major economic transformation and [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|national industrial development plan]] led by Minister [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], the main architect of the [[Gdynia|Gdynia seaport]] project, was in progress at the time of the outbreak of [[World War II|the war]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 249-250&lt;/ref&gt; The interwar period's overall economic situation in Poland was, however, stagnant. The total industrial production (within the pre-1939 borders) had barely increased between 1913 and 1939, but because of the population growth, the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 17.8%.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poland1939 physical.jpg|thumb|right|315px|[[Second Polish Republic]] (until 1939)]]

The lack of sufficient domestic or foreign investment funding precluded by 1939 the level of industrial development necessary for creating modern armed forces for successful self-defense; because of its strategic and tactical priorities, the ruling establishment had  not primarily prepared the country for a major war on the western front.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; The regime of Piłsudski's &quot;colonels&quot;, left in power after the Marshal's death, had neither the vision nor resources to cope with the deteriorating situation in Europe. The government (foreign policy conduct was the responsibility of [[Józef Beck]]) undertook opportunistic hostile actions against [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts|Czechoslovakia]], while it failed to control the increasingly fractured situation at home, where fringe groups and extreme nationalist circles were getting more outspoken (one [[Camp of National Unity]] was connected to the new strongman, Marshal [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]]).&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 247-248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 127-129&quot;/&gt;

In 1939, the Polish government rejected the German offer of forming an alliance on terms which would amount to an end or severe curtailment of Poland's sovereignty; [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] abrogated the Polish-German pact.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war broke out, Poland entered into a full military alliance with Britain and France; the western powers lacked the will to confront [[Nazi Germany]] and their (false) assurances of imminent military action were only intended as pressure applied to deter Hitler.&lt;ref name=&quot;playground 319-320&quot;/&gt; The mid-August British-French talks with the Soviets on forming an anti-Nazi defensive military alliance had failed, in part over the Polish government's refusal to allow the Red Army to operate on Polish territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalin 'planned to send a million troops to stop Hitler if Britain and France agreed pact'&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 155-156&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|b|b|none}} On August 23, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop]] non-aggression pact, which secretly provided for the dismemberment of Poland into [[Nazism|Nazi]] and Soviet-controlled zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart 127-129&quot;/&gt;

Fighting the initial &quot;[[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]]&quot; of World War II was the most significant [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish contribution to the allied war effort]]. The nearly one million Polish soldiers mobilized significantly delayed [[Battle of France|Hitler's attack on Western Europe]], planned for 1939.

The Poles formed an [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance movement]] and a [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish government in exile]], first in [[Paris]] and later in [[London]], which was recognized by the Soviet Union (diplomatic relations, broken since September 1939, were resumed in July 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 375-382&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, about 300,000 Poles [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|fought under the Soviet command]], and about 200,000 went into [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|combat on western fronts]] in units loyal to the Polish government in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Brzoza, Andrzej Leon Sowa – ''Historia Polski 1918-1945'' (History of Poland 1918-1945), p. 693-694&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1943, the Soviet Union broke the deteriorating relations with the Polish government in exile after the German military announced that they had discovered mass graves of [[Katyn massacre|murdered Polish army officers]] at [[Katyn (rural locality)|Katyn]], in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

A Short History of Poland'' by Norman Davies, p. 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944, the Soviet [[Red Army]] and the [[People's Army of Poland]] controlled by the Soviets entered Poland, and through protracted fighting in 1944 and 1945 defeated the Germans, losing 600,000 of their soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 394-395&quot;/&gt;

The greatest single instance of [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|armed struggle in the occupied Poland]] and a major political event of World War II was the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944. The uprising, in which most of the Warsaw population participated, was instigated by the  underground [[Armia Krajowa]] (Home Army) and approved by the Polish government in exile, in an attempt to establish a non-communist Polish administration ahead of the approaching Red Army. The uprising was planned with the expectation that the Soviet forces, who had arrived in the course of their offensive and were present on the other side of the [[Vistula|Vistula River]], would help in battle over Warsaw. However, the Soviets stopped their advance at the Vistula and were mostly passive as the Germans brutally suppressed the forces of the pro-Western Polish underground.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Brzoza, Andrzej Leon Sowa – ''Historia Polski 1918-1945'' (History of Poland 1918-1945), p. 650-663&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 4-5&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Jewish prisones of KZGesiowka liberated by Polish Soldiers of Home Army Warsaw1944.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jewish prisoners liberated by Polish soldiers in the beginning of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]

The bitterly fought uprising lasted for two months and resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilians killed and expelled. After a hopeless surrender on the part of the Poles (October 2), the Germans carried out Hitler's order to destroy the remaining infrastructure of the city. The [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|Polish First Army]], fighting along the Soviet Red Army, entered Warsaw on 17 January 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 4-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Brzoza – ''Polska w czasach niepodległości i II wojny światowej (1918-1945)'' (Poland in times of independence and World War II (1918-1945)), p. 386-387, 390&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the war and by the decision of the Soviet leadership, agreed to by the United States and Britain beginning with the [[Tehran Conference]] (late 1943), Poland's geographic location was fundamentally altered.&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of Europe. A Short History of Poland'' by Norman Davies, p. 75, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 1&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|c|c|none}} [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s proposal that Poland should be moved very far to the west was readily accepted by [[Polish Workers' Party|Polish communists]], who were at that time at the early stages of [[State National Council|forming the post-war government]].&lt;ref&gt;''Holocaust: The Ignored Reality'', by Timothy Snyder, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', July 16, 2009 [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jul/16/holocaust-the-ignored-reality/]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1944, a [[communism|communist]]-controlled &quot;[[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]&quot; was established in [[Lublin]], which caused protests by Prime Minister [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]] and the Polish government in exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 394-395&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 4-5&quot;/&gt;

By the time of the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945), seen by many Poles as the pivotal point when the [[Western betrayal|nation's fate was sealed]] by the Great Powers, the communists had established a [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland|provisional government]] in Poland. The Soviet position at the Conference was strong, corresponding to their advance on the German battlefield. The three Great Powers gave assurances for the conversion of the communist provisional government, by including in it democratic forces from within the country and currently active abroad (the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] and subsequent democratic elections were the agreed stated goals), but the London-based government in exile was not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 398-401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 6-7&quot;/&gt;

After the final (for all practical purposes) settlement at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]], the Soviet Union retained most of the territories captured as a result of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet pact]] (now western [[Ukraine]], western [[Belarus]] and part of [[Lithuania]] around [[Vilnius]]). Poland was compensated with parts of [[Silesia]] including [[Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]] and [[Zielona Góra|Grünberg (Zielona Góra)]], of [[Pomerania]] including [[Szczecin|Stettin (Szczecin)]], and of [[East Prussia]], along with [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]], collectively referred to as the &quot;[[Recovered Territories]]&quot;, which were incorporated into the reconstituted Polish state.

Scientific and numerically correct estimation of the human losses suffered by Polish citizens during World War II does not seem possible because of the paucity of available data. Some conjectures can be arrived at and they suggest that assertions made in the past have been incorrect and motivated by political needs. To begin with, the total population of 1939 Poland and of the several nationalities/[[ethnic group|ethnicities]] present there are not accurately known, since the last [[Polish census of 1931|population census took place in 1931]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 694-695&quot;/&gt;

Modern research indicates that during the war about 5 million Polish citizens were killed, including 3 million [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herausforderung Bevölkerung Part 6&quot;/&gt; According to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Memorial Museum]], at least 1.9 to two million ethnic Poles and 3 million Polish Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish victims&quot;/&gt; Millions were deported to Germany for forced labor or to German extermination camps such as [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. According to a recent estimate, between 2.35 and 2.9 million Polish Jews and about 2 million ethnic Poles were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 695-696&quot;/&gt; Over 95% of the Polish Jewish losses (less directly also many of the rest){{Ref label|d|d|none}} and 90% of the ethnic Polish losses were caused by Nazi Germany; 5% of the ethnic Polish losses were caused by the Soviets and 5% by Ukrainian nationalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 695-696&quot;/&gt; This Jewish loss of life, together with the numerically much less significant waves of displacement during the war and emigration after the war, after the [[Polish October]] 1956 thaw and following the [[1968 Polish political crisis]], put an end to several centuries of large scale, well-established [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish settlement and presence in Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 157-163&quot;/&gt; The magnitudes of the (also substantial) losses of Polish citizens of German, Ukrainian, Belarusian and other nationalities are not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 696&quot;/&gt;

Approximately 90% of Poland's war losses were the victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, annihilation of ghettos, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment. There were one million war orphans and 590,000 war disabled. The country lost 38% of its national assets (Britain lost 0.8%, France 1.5%).&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 410-411&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly half the prewar Poland was expropriated by the Soviet Union, including the two great cultural centers of [[Lviv|Lwów]] and [[Vilnius|Wilno]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 694&quot;/&gt; Many Poles could not return to the country for which they had fought because they belonged to the &quot;wrong&quot; political group, or came from prewar eastern Poland incorporated into the Soviet Union (see [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)]]), or having fought in the West were warned not to return because of the high risk of persecution. Others were pursued, arrested, tortured and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for belonging to the Home Army (see [[Cursed soldiers]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 23-24&quot;/&gt; or persecuted because of having fought on the western front.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Radzilowski]], ''A Traveller's History of Poland''; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, ISBN 1-56656-655-X, p. 223-225&lt;/ref&gt;

With Germany's defeat, as the reestablished Polish state was shifted west to the area between the [[Oder–Neisse line|Oder–Neisse]] and [[Curzon Line|Curzon]] lines, the [[flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|Germans who had not fled were expelled]]. Of those who remained, many chose to [[German exodus from Eastern Europe|emigrate to post-war Germany]]. According to a recently quoted estimate, of the 200-250 thousand Jews who escaped the Nazis, 40-60 thousand had survived in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] wyborcza.pl 2011-01-17, [[Marcin Zaremba]] - ''Biedni Polacy na żniwach - Recenzja &quot;Złotych Żniw&quot;'' (Poor Poles at the harvest - review of &quot;Golden Harvest&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; More had been repatriated from the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and the February 1946 population census showed ca. 300,000 Jews within the new borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 410&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|e|e|none}} Of the surviving Jews, many chose or [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|felt compelled]] to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J.

Because of the changing borders and of mass movements of people of various nationalities, sponsored by governments and spontaneous, the emerging communist Poland ended up with a mainly homogeneous, ethnically Polish population (97.6% according to the December 1950 census).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzoza Sowa 695&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 410, 414-417&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining members of the minorities were not encouraged, by the authorities or by their neighbors, to emphasize their ethnic identity.

In June 1945, as an implementation of the February [[Yalta Conference]] directives, according to the Soviet interpretation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 6-7&quot;/&gt; a Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed; it was soon recognized by the United States and many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Buszko – ''Historia Polski 1864–1948'' (History of Poland 1864–1948), p. 406-408&lt;/ref&gt; A [[communism|communist]] rule and Soviet domination were apparent from the beginning: sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial in Moscow]] in June 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 8&quot;/&gt; 

A [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|national referendum]] arranged for by the communist [[Polish Workers' Party]] was used to legitimize its dominance in Polish politics and claim widespread support for the party's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Prażmowska – ''A History of Poland'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 9&quot;/&gt; Although the Yalta agreement called for free elections, [[Polish legislative election, 1947|those held in January 1947]] were controlled by the communists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamoyski 369-370&quot;/&gt; Some democratic and pro-Western elements, led by [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]], the former [[Polish government-in-exile|Prime Minister in Exile]], participated in the Provisional National Unity Government and the 1947 elections, but were ultimately eliminated through [[electoral fraud]], intimidation and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamoyski 369-370&quot;/&gt; In times of radical change, they attempted to preserve some degree of [[mixed economy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 417-425&quot;/&gt; The [[Polish government in exile]] had remained in continuous existence until 1990, although its influence was degraded.

A [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') was created under the communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]] rule after the brief period of coalition &quot;National Unity&quot; government. The [[Polish United Workers' Party|ruling party]] itself was a result of the forced amalgamation (December 1948) of the communist Polish Workers' Party and the historically non-communist, more popular [[Polish Socialist Party]] (the party, reestablished in 1944, had been from that time allied with the communists).&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 442-445&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 18&quot;/&gt; The ruling communists, who in post-war Poland preferred to use the term &quot;socialism&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 18&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|f|f|none}} needed to include the socialist junior partner to broaden their appeal, claim greater legitimacy and eliminate competition on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. The socialists, who were losing their organization, had to be subjected to political pressure, ideological cleansing and purges in order to become suitable for the unification on the &quot;Workers' Party&quot;'s terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buszko 442-445&quot;/&gt;

During the most oppressive [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] period, terror, justified by the necessity to eliminate the reactionary subversion, was widespread; many thousands of perceived opponents of the regime were arbitrarily tried and large numbers executed. The People's Republic was led by discredited [[Soviet Union|Moscow]]'s operatives such as [[Bolesław Bierut]] and [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita J.

State-run institutions, collectivization and cooperative entities were imposed (the last category dismantled in the 1940s as not socialist enough, later reestablished),&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 27&quot;/&gt; while even small-scale private enterprises were being eradicated.

In October 1956, after the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Soviet Party Congress]] in Moscow ushered in [[de-Stalinization]] and [[Poznań 1956 protests|riots by workers in Poznań]] ensued,&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 76-92&quot;/&gt; there was a shakeup in the communist regime. While retaining most traditional communist economic and social aims, the regime led by the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Polish Communist Party]]'s First Secretary [[Władysław Gomułka]] began to [[Polish October|liberalize internal life in Poland]]. Several years of relative stabilization followed the [[Polish legislative election, 1957|legislative election of 1957]].

In 1965, the [[Polish Episcopal Conference|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]]. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Baptism of Poland]] led by Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszyński]] and other bishops turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Polish Catholic Church]].

[[Culture in the People's Republic of Poland|Sophisticated cultural life]] developed under Gomułka and his successors, even if the creative process had often been compromised by state censorship. Significant productions were accomplished in fields such as literature, theater, cinema and music, among others. Journalism of veiled understanding and native varieties of popular trends and styles of western [[popular culture|mass culture]] were well represented. Uncensored information and [[Kultura|works generated]] by [[émigré]] circles were conveyed by a variety of channels, the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] being of foremost importance.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Prażmowska – ''A History of Poland'', p. 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the liberalizing trend was reversed when [[1968 Polish political crisis|student demonstrations were suppressed]] and an [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] campaign initially directed against Gomułka supporters within the party eventually led to the [[1968 Polish political crisis|emigration of much of Poland's remaining Jewish population]].

Fueled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland's economic growth rate was one of the world's highest during the first half of the 1970s. But much of the borrowed capital was misspent, and the centrally [[planned economy]] was unable to use the new resources effectively. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s, and economic growth had become negative by 1979. 

In October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], Cardinal [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Józef Wojtyła]], became Pope [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], head of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. Polish Catholics rejoiced at the elevation of a Pole to the [[pope|papacy]] and greeted his June 1979 visit to Poland with an outpouring of emotion.

On July 1, 1980, with the Polish foreign debt at more than $20 billion, the government made another attempt to increase meat prices. A [[History of Solidarity|chain reaction of strikes]] virtually paralyzed the Baltic coast by the end of August and, for the first time, closed most coal mines in [[Silesia]]. Poland was entering into an extended crisis that would change the course of its future development.

On August 31, workers at the [[Gdańsk Shipyard|Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk]], led by an electrician named [[Lech Wałęsa]], signed a [[Gdańsk Agreement|21-point agreement with the government]] that ended their strike. Similar agreements were signed at Szczecin and in Silesia. The key provision of these agreements was the guarantee of the workers' right to form independent [[trade union]]s and the right to strike. After the [[Gdańsk Agreement]] was signed, a new national union movement &quot;[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]&quot; swept Poland.

The discontent underlying the strikes was intensified by revelations of widespread corruption and mismanagement within the Polish state and party leadership. In September 1980, Gierek was replaced by [[Stanisław Kania]] as First Secretary.

Alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Party]]'s authority following the Gdańsk agreement, the Soviet Union proceeded with a massive military buildup along Poland's border in December 1980. In February 1981, Defense Minister Gen. [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] assumed the position of Prime Minister, and in October 1981, was named First Secretary. At the [[History of Solidarity|first Solidarity national congress]] in September–October 1981, Lech Wałęsa was elected national chairman of the union.

On December 12–13, the regime declared [[martial law in Poland|martial law]], under which the army and [[ZOMO]] riot police were used to crush the union. Virtually all Solidarity leaders and many affiliated intellectuals were arrested or detained. The United States and other Western countries responded to martial law by imposing economic sanctions against the Polish regime and against the Soviet Union. Unrest in Poland continued for several years thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 325-331&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Pope John Paul II 11 06 1987 01.jpg|thumb|right|315 px|[[Pope John Paul II]] in Poland in 1987]]

Having achieved some semblance of stability, the Polish regime in several stages relaxed and then rescinded martial law. By December 1982, martial law was suspended, and a small number of political prisoners, including Wałęsa, were released. Although martial law formally ended in July 1983 and a partial amnesty was enacted, several hundred political prisoners remained in jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 325-331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 336-348&quot;/&gt;

In September 1986, general amnesty was declared and the government released nearly all political prisoners. Throughout the period the authorities continued to harass dissidents and Solidarity activists. Solidarity remained proscribed and its publications banned; independent publications were censored. However, with the economic crisis unresolved and societal institutions dysfunctional, both the ruling establishment and Solidarity-led opposition began looking for ways out of the stalemate, and exploratory contacts were being established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 336-348&quot;/&gt;

The government's inability to forestall Poland's economic decline led to waves of strikes across the country in April, May and August 1988. Under the reformist leadership of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the Soviet Union was becoming increasingly destabilized and unwilling to apply military and other pressure to prop up allied regimes in trouble. In the late 1980s, the government was forced to negotiate with Solidarity in the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Polish Round Table Negotiations]]. The resulting [[Polish legislative election, 1989|Polish legislative election in 1989]] was a watershed event marking the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Poland.

The [[Polish Round Table Agreement|&quot;round-table&quot; talks]] with the opposition began in February 1989. These talks produced the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] in April for [[Polish legislative election, 1989|partly open National Assembly elections]]. The failure of the communists at the polls produced a political crisis. The agreement called for a [[April Novelization|communist president]], and on July 19, the [[Contract Sejm|National Assembly]], with the support of a number of Solidarity deputies, elected General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to that office. However, two attempts by the communists to form governments failed.

On August 19, President Jaruzelski asked journalist/Solidarity activist [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] to form a government; on September 12, the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] (national legislature) voted approval of Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet. For the first time in post-war history, Poland had a government led by noncommunists, setting a precedent to be soon followed by many other communist-ruled nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism ix&quot;/&gt;

In December 1989, the ''Sejm'' approved the government's reform program to transform the Polish economy rapidly from centrally planned to free-market, amended the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|constitution]] to eliminate references to the &quot;leading role&quot; of the Communist Party, and renamed the country the &quot;Republic of Poland.&quot; The [[Polish United Workers' Party|Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party]] dissolved itself in January 1990, creating in its place a new party, [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]].

In October 1990, the constitution was amended to curtail the term of President Jaruzelski.

In the early 1990s, Poland made great progress towards achieving a fully democratic government and a market economy. In November 1990, Lech Wałęsa [[Polish presidential election, 1990|was elected president]] for a five-year term. In December Wałęsa became the first popularly elected [[President of Poland]].

Poland's [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|first free parliamentary election]] was held in 1991. More than 100 parties participated, and no single party received more than 13% of the total vote. In [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|1993 parliamentary election]] the &quot;post-communist&quot; [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) received the largest share of votes. In 1993 the Soviet [[Northern Group of Forces]] finally left Poland.

In November 1995, Poland held its [[Polish presidential election, 1995|second post-war free presidential election]]. SLD leader [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] defeated Wałęsa by a narrow margin—51.7% to 48.3%.

In [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]] two parties with roots in the Solidarity movement — [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS) and the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] (UW) — won 261 of the 460 seats in the ''Sejm'' and formed a coalition government. In April 1997, the new [[Constitution of Poland]] was finalized, and in July put into effect, replacing the previously used [[Small Constitution of 1992|amended]] [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|communist statute]].

Poland joined [[NATO]] in 1999. Elements of the [[Polish Armed Forces]] have since participated in the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]].

In the [[Polish presidential election, 2000|presidential election of 2000]], Aleksander Kwaśniewski, the incumbent former leader of the [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]], was re-elected in the first round of voting. After [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|September 2001 parliamentary election]] SLD (a successor of the communist party) formed a coalition with the agrarian [[Polish People's Party]] (PSL) and the leftist [[Labour Union (Poland)|Labor Union]] (UP).

Poland joined the [[European Union]] in May 2004. Both President Kwaśniewski and the government were vocal in their support for this cause. The only party decidedly opposed to EU entry was the populist right-wing [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR).

After the fall of communism the government policy of guaranteed full employment had ended and many large unprofitable state enterprises were closed or restructured. This and other economic woes of the transition period caused the unemployment to be at times as high as 20%. With the [[European Union|EU]] access, the gradual opening of West European labor markets to Polish workers, combined with the domestic economic growth, led to marked improvement in the employment situation (currently at around or above 10%) in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unemployment rate Poland&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland Unemployment rate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurostat unemployment&quot;/&gt;

[[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|September's 2005 parliamentary election]] was expected to produce a coalition of two center-right parties, PiS ([[Law and Justice]]) and PO ([[Civic Platform]]). During the bitter campaign PiS overtook PO, gaining 27% of votes cast and becoming the largest party in the Sejm, ahead of PO with 24%. In the [[Polish presidential election, 2005|presidential election in October]] the early favorite, [[Donald Tusk]], leader of the PO, was beaten 54% to 46% in the second round by the PiS candidate [[Lech Kaczyński]].
Coalition talks ensued simultaneously with the presidential elections, but negotiations ended up in a stalemate and the PO decided to go into opposition. PiS formed a minority government which relied on the support of smaller populist and agrarian parties ([[Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland|Samoobrona]], [[League of Polish Families|LPR]]) to govern. This became a formal coalition, but its deteriorating state made early parliamentary election necessary.

[[File:Sejm 2009 Komorowski.jpg|thumb|left|175 px|Current president [[Bronislaw Komorowski]] as the [[Marshal of the Sejm]]]]

In the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]], the Civic Platform was most successful (41.5%), ahead of Law and Justice (32%), and the government of Donald Tusk, the chairman of PO, was formed. PO governs in a parliamentary majority coalition with the smaller Polish People's Party (PSL).

In the current great [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|worldwide economic downturn]], triggered and exemplified in particular by the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|2008 USA collapse and bailout of the banking system]], the Polish economy has weathered the crisis, in comparison with many European and other countries, relatively unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland Likely To Resist Global Slowdown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Gloom in Europe Barely Touches Proud Poland&quot;/&gt; Worrisome signs, signalling upcoming difficulties are however present, and the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], unraveling some of Europe's economies, is expected to negatively affect also the economy of Poland, currently not a member of the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Get a move on&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland Skirts Euro Zone&quot;/&gt;

The social price paid by the Poles for the implementation of [[economic liberalism|liberal free market economic policies]] has been the sharply more inequitable distribution of wealth and the associated impoverishment of large segments of the society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poles apart?&quot;/&gt;
According to 2010 [[Eurostat]] data, 14% of Poles were &quot;severely materially deprived&quot;, compared to the 8% EU average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurostat poverty&quot;/&gt; This however represents the steepest of any European country drop in poverty rates over the past several years (it has taken place since Poland joined the EU).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazeta wyborcza poverty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazeta wyborcza common poverty&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|h|h|none}}

Poland's president Lech Kaczyński and all aboard died in a [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|plane crash on April 10, 2010]] in western Russia, near [[Smolensk]]. President Kaczyński and other prominent Poles were on the way to the [[Katyn massacre]] anniversary commemoration.

In the second final round of the [[Polish presidential election, 2010|Polish presidential election]] on July 4, 2010, [[Bronisław Komorowski]], [[Acting President of Poland|Acting President]], [[Marshal of the Sejm]] and a Civic Platform politician, defeated [[Jarosław Kaczyński]] by 53% to 47%.

The [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk tragedy]] brought into the open deep divisions within the Polish society and became a destabilizing factor in Poland's politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland, Lacking External Enemies, Turns on Itself&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Division mars Poland's Smolensk plane crash anniversary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided Poles mark crash anniversary, rap Russia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish paper Rzeczpospolita fires editors over article on presidential crash &quot;/&gt;

Poland's relations with its European neighbors have been good or improving, with [[Belarus]] being a [[Human rights in Belarus|sore point]].&lt;ref name=&quot;France Joins Poland and Germany on Wider Unity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belarus Warns European Union Over Withdrawal of Envoys&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|i|i|none}} The [[Eastern Partnership]] summit, hosted in September 2011 by Poland, the holder of the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]], resulted in no agreement on near future expansion of the Union to include the several considered [[Eastern Europe]]an and [[Caucasus]] states, formerly [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. The European Union membership for at least some of those states, including [[Ukraine]], has long been a goal of Polish diplomacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Move East Not on European Union's Agenda for the Moment&quot;/&gt; Poland has also been promoting NATO membership for Ukraine and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a plan seen by Russia as threatening to its security&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia:Border Conflicts Risk Nuclear War, Officer Says&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia's military chief warns&quot;/&gt; and so far not supported by a majority of Ukrainian voters. For a number of years, Poland and Russia have disagreed on the planned [[NATO missile defense system]] in Europe, in which Poland has sought to be an active participant, and which Russia opposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia warns on missile defence deal with Nato and US&quot;/&gt;

The [[Polish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]] results were generally an affirmation of the current distribution of political forces. The [[Civic Platform]] won over 39% of the votes, [[Law and Justice]] almost 30%, [[Palikot's Movement]] 10%, the [[Polish People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] over 8% each. The new element was the successful debut of the left-of-center movement of [[Janusz Palikot]], a maverick politician, which resulted in decreased electoral appeal of the Democratic Left Alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland election: In historic first, PM gets a second term&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2007 11 16 Zaprzysiężenie rządu Tuska (2).JPG|thumb|left|250px|Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]]'s governing coalition [[Polish parliamentary election, 2011|received in October 2011]] a majority of parliamentary seats again]]

Poland's foreign minister, [[Radosław Sikorski]], delivered a speech on 28 November 2011 in [[Berlin]], in which he emphatically appealed to Germany and other European Union countries for closer economic and political integration and coordination, to be accomplished through a more powerful [[Institutions of the European Union|central government of the Union]]. Sikorski feels that decisive action and substantial reform, led by Germany, are necessary to prevent a collapse of the euro and subsequent destabilization and possible demise of the European Union. His remarks, directed primarily at the German audience, encountered hostile reception in Poland from Jarosław Kaczyński and his [[Law and Justice|conservative parliamentary opposition]], who accused the minister of betraying Poland's sovereignty and demanded his ouster and trial. Sikorski identified in his speech several areas important to Polish traditionalists, which, he said, should permanently remain within the domain of individual national governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland and the future of the European Union&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Warsaw6vb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Warsaw high-rise district. The city's affluence and low unemployment rate attract newcomers.]]

As of 9 December 2011 UE summit in [[Brussels]], the British opposition prevented any changes to the [[Treaties of the European Union|EU Treaty]]. All the remaining UE governments, including the actively involved Polish delegation led by Prime Minister Tusk, indicated support for the new &quot;fiscal compact&quot; and greater coordination agreement, intended to impose financial discipline on member states and to cure the present instability in the [[eurozone]]. The agreed reforms will be implemented in the laws of individual states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statement by the Euro Area Heads&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe's Debt Crisis Brings&quot;/&gt;

In January 2012, Poland's [[Public Prosecutor General|Prosecutor General]]'s office initiated investigative proceedings against [[Zbigniew Siemiątkowski]], the former [[Agencja Wywiadu|Polish intelligence]] chief. Siemiątkowski is charged with facilitating the alleged [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Black site|detention operation in Poland]], where foreign suspects may have been tortured in the context of the [[War on Terror]]. The alleged [[Constitution of Poland|constitutional]] and [[international law]] [[war crime|trespasses]] took place when [[Leszek Miller]], presently member of [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliament]] and leader of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]], was Prime Minister (2001-2004), and he may also be subjected to future [[State Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|legal action]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland ex-spy boss 'charged over alleged CIA secret prison'&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish Ex-Official Charged With Aiding C.I.A.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Więzienia CIA w Polsce&quot;/&gt; [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], the President of Poland at that time, acknowledged knowing about and consenting to (together with the Prime Minister) the secret &quot;CIA prisons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwaśniewski w szarej strefie więzień CIA&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus'|Russian Patriarch]]'s visit to Poland on August 16–19, 2012, [[Kirill I of Moscow|Kirill I]], Primate of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and Archbishop [[Józef Michalik]], President of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Polish Episcopal Conference|Conference of Polish Bishops]], signed a historic Polish-Russian church message on reconciliation and mutual forgiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Orthodox leader to visit Poland, sign reconciliation statement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Patriarch Kirill makes historic visit to Poland&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Churches in Polish-Russian appeal for friendly ties&quot;/&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]] opted for a larger version, allowing a &quot;swap&quot; (territorial compensation for Poland), which involved the [[Kresy|eastern lands]] gained by Poland at the [[Peace of Riga]] of 1921 and now lost, and [[Recovered Territories|eastern Germany]] conquered form the Nazis in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland under Communism 1-3&quot;/&gt; Other territorial and ethnic scenarios were also possible, generally with outcomes less favorable to Poland than its present form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Davies 1939&quot;/&gt;

''d.''{{Note label|d|d|none}}Timothy Snyder spoke of about 100,000 Jews killed by Poles during the Nazi occupation, majority probably by members of the [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] [[Blue Police]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Polacy wobec Holocaustu&quot;/&gt; This number would have likely been many times higher had Poland entered into an alliance with Germany in 1939, as advocated by some Polish post-war and post-1989 historians and others.

''e.''{{Note label|e|e|none}}Some may have had falsely claimed the [[Jewish identity]] hoping for permissions to emigrate.
