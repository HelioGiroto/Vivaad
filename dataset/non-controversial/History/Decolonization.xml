      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="81130">'''Decolonization''' ([[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|alternative spelling]]: '''decolonisation''') is the undoing of [[colonialism]], the unequal relation of [[Polity|polities]] whereby one people or nation establishes and maintains dependent [[Territory (country subdivision)|Territory]] (courial governments) over another. It can be understood politically (attaining [[independence]], autonomous home rule, union with the [[metropole]] or another state) or culturally (removal of pernicious colonial effects.) The term refers particularly to the dismantlement,  in the years after [[World War II]], of the [[New Imperialism|Neo-Imperial empires]] established prior to [[World War I]] throughout [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Imperialism in Asia|Asia]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization]] has stated that in the process of decolonization there is no alternative to the colonizer's allowance of [[self-determination]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} but in practice decolonization may involve either [[nonviolent revolution]] or [[national liberation wars]] by the native population. It may be intramural or involve the intervention of foreign powers acting individually or through international bodies such as the [[United Nations]]. Although examples of decolonization can be found as early as the writings of [[Thucydides]], there have been several particularly active periods of decolonization in modern times.  These are the [[Spanish American wars of independence|breakup of the Spanish Empire]] in the 19th century; of the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Russian Empire]]s following World War I; of the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], Dutch, [[Portuguese colonial empire|Portuguese]], [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] and [[Italian colonial empire]]s following World War II; of the Russian Empire [[Soviet Union|successor union]] following the [[Cold War]]; and others.

== Methods and stages ==
Decolonization is a political process, frequently involving violence. In extreme circumstances, there is a [[War of Independence|war of independence]], sometimes following a revolution. More often, there is a dynamic cycle where negotiations fail, minor disturbances ensue resulting in suppression by the police and military forces, escalating into more violent [[revolt]]s that lead to further negotiations until independence is granted. In rare cases, the actions of the native population are characterized by [[nonviolence]], with the [[Indian independence movement]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] being one of the most notable examples, and the violence comes as active suppression from the occupying forces or as political opposition from forces representing minority local communities who feel threatened by the prospect of independence. For example, there was a war of independence in [[French Indochina]], while in some countries in [[French West Africa]] (excluding the [[Maghreb]] countries) decolonization resulted from a combination of insurrection and negotiation. The process is only complete when the ''de facto'' government of the newly independent country is recognized as the ''de jure'' [[sovereign state]] by the community of nations.

Independence is often difficult to achieve without the encouragement and practical support from one or more external parties. The motives for giving such aid are varied: nations of the same ethnic and/or religious stock may sympathize with oppressed groups, or a strong nation may attempt to destabilize a colony as a tactical move to weaken a rival or enemy colonizing power or to create space for its own [[sphere of influence]]; examples of this include British support of the [[Haitian Revolution]] against France, and the [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, in which the United States warned the European powers not to interfere in the affairs of the newly independent states of the [[Western Hemisphere]].

As world opinion became more pro-emancipation following [[World War I]], there was an ''institutionalised collective effort'' to advance the cause of emancipation through the [[League of Nations]]. Under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, a number of [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]]s were created. The expressed intention was to prepare these countries for self-government, but are often interpreted as a mere redistribution of control over the former colonies of the defeated powers, mainly [[Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This reassignment work continued through the [[United Nations]], with a similar system of [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territories]] created to adjust control over both former colonies and mandated territories. 

In referendums, some colonized populations have chosen to retain their colonial status, such as [[Gibraltar]] and [[French Guiana]].  There are even examples, such as the [[Falklands War]], in which an Imperial power goes to war to defend the right of a colony to continue to be a colony.  Colonial powers have sometimes promoted decolonization in order to shed the financial, military and other burdens that tend to grow in those colonies where the colonial regimes have become more benign.

Decolonization is rarely achieved through a single historical act, but rather progresses through one or more stages of emancipation, each of which can be offered or fought for: these can include the introduction of elected representatives (advisory or voting; minority or majority or even exclusive), degrees of autonomy or self-rule. Thus, the final phase of decolonisation may in fact concern little more than handing over responsibility for foreign relations and security, and soliciting ''de jure'' recognition for the new [[sovereignty]]. But, even following the recognition of statehood, a degree of continuity can be maintained through bilateral treaties between now equal governments involving practicalities such as military training, mutual protection pacts, or even a garrison and/or military bases.

There is some debate over whether or not the [[Americas]] can be considered decolonized, as it was the colonist and their descendants who revolted and declared their independence instead of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], as is usually the case.  Furthermore, included in this list of states where &quot;decolonization&quot; has not occurred as per the ideas reflected above are Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

==History==

===American Revolution===
{{main|American Revolution|Revolutionary War}}
Great Britain's [[Thirteen Colonies|Thirteen North American colonies]] were the first to break from the [[British Empire]] in 1776, and were recognized as an independent nation by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 after Britain's defeat at the hands of American militias and the French. The United States of America was the first European colonial entity to achieve independence and the first independent nation in the Americas.

===Decolonization of the Spanish Americas===
{{Main|Decolonization of the Americas}}
With the invasion of Spain by Napoleon in 1806, the American colonies declared autonomy and loyalty to the King Fernand VII. In 1809, the independence wars of Latino America begun with a revolt in La Paz, Bolivia. During the next 15 years, the Spanish and the rebels fought in South America and Mexico. Numerous countries declared independence. In 1824, the Spanish forces were defeated in the Battle of Ayacucho. The mainland was free and in 1898, Spain lost Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Spanish American War. Cuba was independent in 1902.

===Decolonization of the Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Eastern Question|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}
A number of peoples (mainly [[Christian]]s in the [[Balkans]]) previously conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] were able to achieve independence in the 19th century, a process that peaked at the time of the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877-78.

====Egypt====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali's seizure of power}}
In the wake of the 1798 [[French Invasion of Egypt]] and its subsequent expulsion in 1801, the commander of an [[Albanian Pashaliks|Albania]]n regiment, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], was able to gain control of [[Egypt Province, Ottoman Empire|Egypt]].  Although he was acknowledged by the [[Selim III|Sultan]] in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1805 as his ''[[pasha]]'', Muhammad Ali was in reality monarch of a practically sovereign state.

====Greece====
{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}
The Greek War of Independence (1821—1829) was fought to liberate Greece from a three centuries long [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation.  Independence was secured by the intervention of the [[British Navy|British]] and [[French Navy|French navies]] and the [[French Army|French]] and [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian armies]], but Greece was limited to an area including perhaps only one-third of ethnic Greeks, that later grew significantly with the [[Megali Idea]] project. The war ended many of the privileges of the [[Phanariot]] Greeks of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].

====Bulgaria====
{{Main|Bulgarian National Revival}}
Following a [[April Uprising|failed Bulgarian revolt]] in 1876, the subsequent [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish war]] ended with the provisional [[Treaty of San Stefano]] established a huge new realm of Bulgaria including most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace (region)|Thrace]]. The final [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|1878 Treaty of Berlin]] allowed the other Great Powers to limit the size of the new Russian [[client state]] and even briefly divided this rump state in two, Bulgaria and [[Eastern Rumelia]], but the [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims from the first treaty would direct Bulgarian claims through the [[First Balkan War|first]] and [[second Balkan War]]s and both World Wars.

====Romania====
{{Main|National awakening of Romania}}
Romania fought on the Russian side in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] and in the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|1878 Treaty of Berlin]], Romania was recognized as an [[Romanian War of Independence|independent]] state by the [[Great Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|work=Internet Modern History Sourcebook|title=The Treaty of Berlin, 1878 - Excerpts on the Balkans|date=July 13, 1878|place=Berlin|url =http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1878berlin.html|accessdate=2008-08-31|publisher=Fordham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Patterson|first =Michelle|title =The Road to Romanian Independence|journal =Canadian Journal of History|date=August 1996|url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098|accessdate=2008-08-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080324063246/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Serbia====
{{Main|Serbian revolution}}
Decades of armed and unarmed struggle ended with the recognition of [[Serbia]]n independence from the Ottoman Empire at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.

====Montenegro====
The independence of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] from the Ottoman Empire was recognized at the [[congress of Berlin]] in 1878.

=== Decolonization after 1918 ===

==== Western European colonial powers ====
{{Further|New Imperialism|Colonialism}}
[[Image:Socialism liberation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Czechoslovak anti-colonialist propaganda poster: &quot;Socialism opened the door of liberation for colonial nations.&quot;]]

The New Imperialism period, with the [[scramble for Africa]] and the [[Opium War]]s, marked the zenith of European colonization. It also marked the acceleration of the trends that would end it. The extraordinary material demands of the conflict had spread economic change across the world (notably inflation), and the associated social pressures of &quot;war imperialism&quot; created both peasant unrest and a burgeoning middle class.

[[Economic growth]] created stakeholders with their own demands, while [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] issues meant these people clearly stood apart from the colonial middle-class and had to form their own group. The start of mass [[nationalism]], as a concept and practice, would fatally undermine the ideologies of imperialism.

There were, naturally, other factors, from agrarian change (and disaster &amp;ndash; [[French Indochina]]), changes or developments in religion ([[Buddhism]] in [[Burma]], [[Islam]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], marginally people like [[John Chilembwe]] in [[Malawi|Nyasaland]]), and the impact of the depression of the 1930s.

The [[Great Depression]], despite the concentration of its impact on the industrialized world, was also exceptionally damaging in the rural colonies. Agricultural prices fell much harder and faster than those of industrial goods. From around 1925 until [[World War II]], the colonies suffered. The colonial powers concentrated on domestic issues, [[protectionism]] and tariffs, disregarding the damage done to international trade flows. The colonies, almost all primary &quot;[[cash crop]]&quot; producers, lost the majority of their export income and were forced away from the &quot;open&quot; complementary colonial economies to &quot;closed&quot; systems. While some areas returned to [[subsistence farming]] ([[British Malaya]]) others diversified  (India, [[West Africa]]), and some began to industrialise. These economies would not fit the colonial straitjacket when efforts were made to renew the links. Further, the European-owned and -run [[plantation]]s proved more vulnerable to extended [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] than native [[capitalism|capitalist]]s, reducing the dominance of &quot;white&quot; farmers in colonial economies and making the European [[government]]s and investors of the 1930s co-opt [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] elites &amp;mdash; despite the implications for the future.  Colonial reform also hastened their end; notably the move from non-interventionist collaborative systems towards directed, disruptive, direct management to drive economic change. The creation of genuine bureaucratic government boosted the formation of indigenous [[bourgeoisie]].

==== United Kingdom ====

The emergence of indigenous bourgeois elites was especially characteristic of the [[British Empire]], which seemed less capable (or less ruthless) in controlling political nationalism. Driven by pragmatic demands of budgets and manpower the British made deals with the nationalist elites.  Across the empire, the general protocol was to convene a constitutional conference in London to discuss the transition to greater self-government and then independence, submit a report of the constitutional conference to parliament, if approved submit a bill to Parliament at Westminster to terminate the responsibity of the United Kingdom (with a copy of the new constitution annexed), and finally, if approved, issuance of an Order of Council fixing the exact date of independence.&lt;ref&gt;J.H.W. Verzijl. 1969. ''International Law in Historical Perspective, Volume II''. Leyden: A.W. Sijthoff. Pp. 76-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  

London dealt with the white [[dominion]]s, retained strategic resources at the cost of reducing direct control in [[Egypt]], and made numerous reforms in the [[British Raj]], culminating in the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act]] (1935).  Despite these efforts though, the British Government continued to slowly lose their control of the Raj.  The end of World War II allowed India, in addition to various other European colonies, to take advantage of the postwar chaos that had began to exist in Europe during the mid 1940s.  [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], India's independence movement leader, realized the advantage in conducting a peaceful resistance to the British Empire's attempts to retake control of their &quot;crown jewel&quot;.  By becoming a symbol of both peace and opposition to British imperialism, many Indian citizens began to view the British as the cause of India's violence leading to a newfound sense of [[Nationalist Movements in India|nationalism]] among its population.  With this new wave of Indian nationalism, Gandhi was eventually able to garner the support needed to push back the British and create an independent India in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Lynn, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, R. Po-chia Hsia, and Bonnie G. Smith. ''The Making of the West Peoples and Cultures''. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical Africa was only fully drawn into the colonial system at the end of the 19th century. Nevertheless, the [[Union of South Africa]] which, by introducing rigid [[racial segregation]] from 1913 was already catalyzing the anti-colonial political agitation of half the continent. While, in the north-east the continued independence of the [[Empire of Ethiopia]] remained a beacon of hope. Colonial inequities ranged between extremes, from British Kenya's dispossession of local farmers, to [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]]'s massacres in the Congo or the looting of Benin City. However, with the resistance wars of the 1900s (decade) barely over, new modernising forms of African Nationalism began to gain strength in the early 20th-century with the emergence of Pan-Africanism, as advocated by the Jamaican journalist [[Marcus Garvey]] (1887–1940) whose widely distributed newspapers demanded swift abolition of European imperialism, as well as republicanism in Egypt. [[Kwame Nkrumah]] (1909–1972) who was inspired by the works of Garvey led Ghana to independence from colonial rule, while the republican Nasser led Egypt to resist British occupation. {{cleanup|section|date=May 2008}}

==== United States ====
{{POV|date=December 2010}}
{{Main|American empire|Timeline of United States military operations}}
A former colony itself, the [[United States]] approached imperialism differently from the Great Powers and Japan. Much of its energy and rapidly expanding population was directed westward across the [[North America]]n continent against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], and [[Mexico]]. With eventual assistance from the [[British Navy]], its [[Monroe Doctrine]] reserved the Americas as its sphere of interest, prohibiting other states (particularly Spain) from recolonizing the recently freed polities of [[Latin America]]. Economic and political pressure, as well as assaults by [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]], were brought to bear, but Northern fears of the expansion of slavery into new territories restrained the United States from early expansion into [[Cuba]] or [[Central America]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. America's only African colony, [[Liberia]], was formed privately and achieved independence early. While the United States had few qualms about opening the markets of [[Battles for Shimonoseki|Japan]], [[United States expedition to Korea|Korea]], and [[China Relief Expedition|China]] by military force, it advocated an [[Open Door Policy]] and opposed the direct division and colonization of those states. 

Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and particularly during and after the presidency of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], direct intervention in Latin America and elsewhere expanded. The United States purchased [[Russian America]] from the tsar and accepted the offer of [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]] from rebel expatriates and seized several colonies from [[Spain]] in 1898. Barred from annexing [[Cuba]] outright by the [[Teller Amendment]], the U.S. established it as a [[client state]] with obligations including the perpetual lease of [[Guantánamo Bay]] to the U.S. Navy. The attempt of the first governor to void the island's constitution and remain in power past the end of his term provoked a rebellion that provoked a reoccupation between 1906 and 1909, but this was again followed by devolution. Similarly, the [[McKinley administration]], despite prosecuting the [[Philippine–American War]] against a [[First Republic of the Philippines|native republic]], set out that the [[Territories_of_the_United_States#Former_unincorporated_territories_of_the_United_States_.28incomplete.29|Territory of the Philippine Islands]] was eventually granted independence.&lt;ref&gt;^Wong, Kwok Chu. &quot;The Jones Bills 1912-16: A Reappraisal of Filipino Views on Independence,&quot; ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' 13(2): 252-269. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's 1895 attempt to reject the Monroe Doctrine during the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895]], the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]], and the establishment of the client state of [[Panama]] in 1903 via [[gunboat diplomacy]], however, all necessitated the maintenance of [[Puerto Rico]] as a naval base to secure shipping lanes to the Caribbean and the new [[Panama Canal Zone|canal zone]]. In 1917, &quot;Puerto Ricans were collectively made U.S. citizens&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow. 2005. ''The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803-1898''. New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers. Pp. 166, 178. &quot;U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 (1971) (codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731 (1987)&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; via the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]], and in 1952 the US Congress turned the [[Territory of Puerto Rico|territory]] into a [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico|commonwealth]] after ratifying the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|Constitution]] born out of United States Public Law 600.&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 3, 1950, Ch. 446, 64 Stat. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; The US government then declared the territory was no longer a colony and stopped transmitting information about Puerto Rico to the United Nations Decolonization Committee. As a result, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 748|UN General Assembly]] removed Puerto Rico from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|U.N. list of non-self-governing territories]]. Dissatisfied with their new political status, Puerto Ricans turned to political referendums to let make their opinions known. Several internal plebiscites, non-binding upon the United States, proposing [[U.S. state|statehood]] or independence for the island did not garnish a majority in 1967, 1993, and 1998. As a result of the UN not applying the full set of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of Puerto Rico,&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/086/13/IMG/NR008613.pdf?OpenElement General Assembly Resolution 748] (27 november 1953), &quot;Cessation of transmission of the information under article 73 e of the Charter in respect of Puerto Rico&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/153/15/IMG/NR015315.pdf?OpenElement GA Resolution 1541] (15 December 1960), &quot;Principles which should guide Members in determining whether or not an obligation exists to transmit the information called for in article 73 e of the Charter. (See ANNEX).&lt;/ref&gt; the nature of Puerto Rico's relationship with the U.S. continues to be the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rican politics, the [[United States Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf|title=Political Status of Puerto Rico: Background, Options, and Issues in the 109th Congress|date=May 25, 2005|author=Keith Bea|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=2007-10-01|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sdc&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Special committee on decolonization approves text calling on United States to expedite Puerto Rican self-determination process|date=June 13, 2006|publisher=Department of Public Information, United Nations General Assembly|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/gacol3138.doc.htm|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-17-4-c.html# ''Puerto Rico: Commonwealth, Statehood, or Independence?''

The Monroe Doctrine received the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] in 1904, providing that the United States had a right and obligation to intervene &quot;in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence&quot; that a nation in the Western Hemisphere became vulnerable to European control. In practice, this meant that the United States was led to act as a collections agent for European creditors by administering customs duties in the [[Dominican Republic]] (1905–1941), [[Haiti]] (1915–1934), and elsewhere. The intrusiveness and bad relations this engendered were somewhat checked by the [[Clark Memorandum]] and renounced by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s &quot;[[Good Neighbor Policy]].&quot; The end of World War II saw America producing 46% of the world's GDP,&lt;ref&gt;Julius, Deanne. [http://hir.harvard.edu/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1287 &quot;US Economic Power: Waxing or Waning?&quot;] ''Energy'' Vol. 26 (4). Winter 2005. Op cit. ''Harvard International Review''. Accessed 7 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but pouring billions of dollars into the [[Marshall Plan]] and restoring independent (if anti-Communist) democracies in [[Japan]] and [[West Germany]]. The post-war period also saw America push hard to accelerate decolonialization and bring an end to the colonial empires of its Western allies, most importantly during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], but American military bases were established around the world and direct and indirect interventions continued in [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Vietnam War|Indochina]], Latin America (''inter alia'', the [[1965 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|1965 occupation of the Dominican Republic]]), Africa, and the Middle East to oppose Communist invasions and insurgencies. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States has been far less active in the Americas, but invaded [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, establishing army and air bases in [[Central Asia]].

==== Japan ====
Japan had gained several substantial colonial concessions in east Asia such as [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]]. Pursuing a colonial policy comparable to those of European powers, Japan settled significant populations of ethnic Japanese in its colonies while simultaneously suppressing indigenous ethnic populations by enforcing the learning and use of the [[Japanese language]] in schools. Other methods such as public interaction, and attempts to eradicate the use of [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], and [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]] among the indigenous peoples, were seen to be used.
Japan also set up  [[National Seven Universities|Imperial universities]] in Korea ([[Keijo Imperial University]]) and Taiwan ([[Taihoku University]]) to compel education.

World War II gave the [[Japanese Empire]] occasion to conquer vast swaths of Asia, sweeping into [[China]] and seizing the Western colonies of [[Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], [[Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]] and [[Indonesia]] among others, albeit only for the duration of the war. An estimated 20 million Chinese died during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1931–1945).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/15/content_468908.htm Remember role in ending fascist war]&lt;/ref&gt; Following its surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945, Japan was deprived of all its colonies. Japan further claims that the southern [[Kuril Islands]] are a small portion of its own national territory, colonized by the [[Soviet Union]].

==== French decolonization ====
{{Further|French colonial empire}}

After World War I, the colonized people were frustrated at France's failure to recognize the effort provided by the French colonies (resources, but more importantly colonial troops - the famous ''[[tirailleurs]]''). Although in [[Paris]] the [[Great Mosque of Paris]] was constructed as recognition of these efforts, the French state had no intention to allow [[self-rule]], let alone grant [[independence]] to the colonized people. Thus, [[nationalism]] in the colonies became stronger in between the two wars, leading to [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]]'s [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] (1921–1925) in [[History of Morocco|Morocco]] and to the creation of [[Messali Hadj]]'s [[Star of North Africa]] in [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algeria]] in 1925. However, these movements would gain full potential only after World War II. The October 27, 1946 Constitution creating the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] substituted the [[French Union]] to the colonial empire. On the night of March 29, 1947, a [[Madagascar revolt|nationalist uprising in Madagascar]] led the French government headed by [[Paul Ramadier]] ([[Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière|Socialist]]) to violent repression: one year of bitter fighting, in which 90,000 to 100,000 Malagasy died. On May 8, 1945, the [[Sétif massacre]] took place in Algeria.

In 1946, the states of [[French Indochina]] withdrew from the Union, leading to the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] (1946–54) against [[Ho Chi Minh]], who had been a co-founder of the [[French Communist Party]] in 1920 and had founded the [[Vietminh]] in 1941. In 1956, Morocco and [[History of Tunisia|Tunisia]] gained their independence, while the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian War]] was raging (1954–1962). Similarly, a decade earlier, [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] achieved independence in order for the French to focus to keeping [[Vietnam]]. With [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s return to power in 1958 amidst turmoil and threats of a right-wing coups d'état to protect &quot;French Algeria&quot;, the decolonization was completed with the independence of Sub-Saharan Africa's colonies in 1960 and the March 19, 1962 [[Evian Accords]], which put an end to the Algerian war. The [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]] movement unsuccessfully tried to block the accords with a series of bombings, including an attempted assassination against Charles de Gaulle.

To this day, the Algerian war &amp;mdash; officially called until the 1990s a &quot;public order operation&quot; &amp;mdash; remains a trauma for both France and Algeria. Philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] has spoken of the necessity of a &quot;decolonization of memory&quot;, starting with the recognition of the [[1961 Paris massacre]] during the Algerian war and the recognition of the decisive role of African and especially North African immigrant manpower in the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' post–World War II economic growth period. In the 1960s, due to economic needs for post-war reconstruction and rapid economic growth, French employers actively sought to recruit manpower from the colonies, explaining today's [[demographics of France|multiethnic population]].

==== The Soviet Union and anti-colonialism ====
{{Main|Wars of national liberation}}
The Soviet Union sought to effect the abolishment of colonial governance by Western countries and replace it with the rule of a local [[Communist Party]] under the influence of the Soviet Union, either by direct subversion of Western-leaning or -controlled governments or indirectly by influence of political leadership and support. Many of the revolutions of this time period were inspired or influenced in this way. The conflicts in [[Vietnam]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], and [[Sudan]], among others, have been characterized as such. 

Most Soviet leaders expressed the [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] view that [[imperialism]] was the height of [[capitalism]], and generated a class-stratified society. It followed, then, that Soviet leadership would encourage independence movements in colonized territories, especially as the [[Cold War]] progressed. Though this was the view expressed by their leaders, such interventions can be interpreted{{Who|date=December 2010}} as the expansion of Soviet interests, not just as aiding the oppressed peoples of the world.  Because so many of these wars of independence expanded into general Cold War conflicts, the United States also supported several such independence movements in opposition to Soviet interests.

[[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s famous [[shoe-banging incident]] occurred in the context of a [[United Nations]] debate on colonialism in 1960. After Khrushchev had decried western colonialism, Filipino delegate [[Lorenzo Sumulong]] accused him of hypocrisy, claiming that the Soviet Union was at that time doing exactly the same thing to the countries of [[Eastern Europe]]. Khrushchev then reportedly became enraged and theatrically banged his shoe on the table while berating Sumulong as a &quot;toady of imperialism,&quot; though accounts of the incident differ.

During the Vietnam War, Communist countries supported anti-colonialist movements in various countries still under colonial administration through propaganda, developmental and economic assistance, and in some cases military aid.  Notably among these were the support of armed rebel movements by [[Cuba]] in [[Angola]], and the Soviet Union (as well as the [[People's Republic of China]]) in [[Vietnam]].

=== The emergence of the Third World (1945-) ===
{{See also|Decolonization of Africa}}
[[Image:Africa cs poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Czechoslovak anti-colonialist propaganda poster: &quot;Africa - in fight for freedom&quot;.]]
The term &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; was coined by French demographer [[Alfred Sauvy]] in 1952, on the model of the [[Third Estate]], which, according to the [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]], represented everything, but was nothing: &quot;...because at the end this ignored, exploited, scorned Third World like the Third Estate, wants to become something too&quot; (Sauvy). The emergence of this new political entity, in the frame of the [[Cold War]], was complex and painful. Several tentatives were made to organize newly independent states in order to oppose a common front towards both the US's and the USSR's influence on them, with the consequences of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] already at works. Thus, the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] constituted itself, around the main figures of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the leader of India, [[Sukarno]], the [[Indonesia]]n president, [[Josip Broz Tito]] the Communist leader of [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], head of [[Egypt]] who successfully opposed the French and British imperial powers during the 1956 [[Suez crisis]]. After the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] which put an end to the French war against [[Ho Chi Minh]] in [[Vietnam]], the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]] gathered Nasser, Nehru, Tito, [[Sukarno]], the leader of [[Indonesia]], and [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]]. In 1960, the [[UN General Assembly]] voted the [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]]. The next year, the Non-Aligned Movement was officially created in [[Belgrade]] (1961), and was followed in 1964 by the creation of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) which tried to promote a [[New International Economic Order]] (NIEO). The NIEO was opposed to the 1944 [[Bretton Woods system]], which had benefited the leading states which had created it, and remained in force until 1971 after the United States' suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold. The main tenets of the NIEO were:
# Developing countries must be entitled to regulate and control the activities of [[multinational corporation]]s operating within their territory.
# They must be free to [[nationalize]] or [[expropriate]] foreign property on conditions favourable to them.
# They must be free to set up associations of [[primary commodities]] producers similar to the [[OPEC|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]], created on September 17, 1960 to protest pressure by major oil companies (mostly owned by U.S., British, and Dutch nationals) to reduce oil prices and payments to producers); all other states must recognize this right and refrain from taking economic, military, or political measures calculated to restrict it.
# International trade should be based on the need to ensure stable, equitable, and remunerative prices for raw materials, generalized non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory tariff preferences, as well as [[transfer of technology]] to developing countries; and should provide economic and [[technical assistance]] without any [[conditionality|strings attached]].
[[Image:HDImap current.png|thumb|350px|The [[UN Human Development Index]] (HDI) is a quantitative index of development, alternative to the classic [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), which some use as a proxy to define the [[Third World]]. While the GDP only calculates economic wealth, the HDI includes [[life expectancy]], [[public health]] and [[literacy]] as fundamental factors of a good [[quality of life]].]]
The UNCTAD however wasn't very effective in implementing this New International Economic Order (NIEO), and social and economic inequalities between industrialized countries and the Third World kept on growing throughout the 1960s until the 21st century. The [[1973 oil crisis]] which followed the [[Yom Kippur War]] (October 1973) was triggered by the OPEC which decided an embargo against the US and Western countries, causing a fourfold increase in the price of oil, which lasted five months, starting on October 17, 1973, and ending on March 18, 1974. OPEC nations then agreed, on January 7, 1975, to raise crude oil prices by 10%. At that time, OPEC nations — including many who had recently nationalised their oil industries — joined the call for a New International Economic Order to be initiated by coalitions of primary producers. Concluding the First OPEC Summit in Algiers they called for stable and just commodity prices, an international food and agriculture program, technology transfer from North to South, and the democratization of the economic system. But industrialized countries quickly began to look for substitutes to OPEC petroleum, with the oil companies investing the majority of their research capital in the US and European countries or others, politically sure countries. The OPEC lost more and more influence on the world prices of oil.

The [[1979 energy crisis|second oil crisis]] occurred in the wake of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Then, the 1982 [[Latin American debt crisis]] exploded in [[Mexico]] first, then [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], which proved unable to pay back their debts, jeopardizing the existence of the international economic system. 

The 1990s were characterized by the prevalence of the [[Washington consensus]] on [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies, &quot;[[structural adjustment]]&quot; and &quot;[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapies]]&quot; for the former Communist states.

== Assassinated anticolonialist leaders ==

A ''non-exhaustive'' [[list of assassinated people|list of assassinated leaders]] would include:

*[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], nonviolent leader of the [[Indian independence movement]] was assassinated in 1948 by Hindu extremists.
*[[Tiradentes]] was a leading member of the [[Brazil]]ian seditious movement known as the [[Inconfidência Mineira]], against the [[Portuguese Empire]]. He fought for an independent Brazilian republic.
*[[Ruben Um Nyobé]], leader of the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (UPC), killed by the French army on September 13, 1958
*[[Barthélemy Boganda]], leader of a nationalist [[Central African Republic]] movement, who died in a plane-crash on March 29, 1959, eight days before the last elections of the colonial era.
*[[Félix-Roland Moumié]], successor to Ruben Um Nyobe at the head of the [[Cameroon's People Union]], assassinated in [[Geneva]] in 1960 by the [[SDECE]] (French secret services).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Foccart]], counsellor to [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Georges Pompidou]] and [[Jacques Chirac]] for African matters, recognized it in 1995 to ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'' review. See also ''Foccart parle, interviews with Philippe Gaillard'', Fayard - ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'' {{fr icon}} and also [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_n49/ai_20319603 &quot;The man who ran Francafrique - French politician Jacques Foccart's role in France's colonization of Africa under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle - Obituary&quot;] in ''[[The National Interest]]'', Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Patrice Lumumba]], the first Prime Minister of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], was assassinated on January 17, 1961.
*[[Burundi]] nationalist [[Louis Rwagasore]] was assassinated on October 13, 1961, while [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]], Burundi's first [[Hutu]] prime minister, was also murdered on January 15, 1965.
*[[Sylvanus Olympio]], the first [[List of Presidents of Togo|president of Togo]], was assassinated on January 13, 1963.
*[[Mehdi Ben Barka]], the leader of the [[History of Morocco|Moroccan]] [[National Union of Popular Forces]] (UNPF) and of the [[Tricontinental Conference]], which was supposed to prepare in 1966 in [[Havana]] its first meeting gathering national liberation movements from all continents &amp;mdash; related to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], but the Tricontinal Conference gathered liberation movements while the Non-Aligned were for the most part states &amp;mdash; was &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]&quot; in Paris in 1965, allegedly by Moroccan agents and French [[police officers]].
*[[Nigeria]]n leader [[Ahmadu Bello]] was assassinated in January 1966.
*[[Eduardo Mondlane]], the leader of [[FRELIMO]] and the father of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] independence, was assassinated in 1969, allegedly by ''Aginter Press'', the Portuguese branch of [[Gladio]], [[NATO]]'s paramilitary organization during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/chronology.htm International Relations and Security Network (ISN), Zurich, Switzerland] hosted by [[ETH Zurich]] University&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pan-African]]ist [[Tom Mboya]] was killed on July 5, 1969.
*[[Abeid Karume]], first president of [[Zanzibar]], was assassinated in April 1972.
*[[Amílcar Cabral]] was murdered on January 20, 1973.
*[[Outel Bono]], [[History of Chad|Chad]]ian opponent of [[François Tombalbaye]], was assassinated on August 26, 1973, making yet another example of the existence of the ''[[Françafrique]]'', designing by this term post-independent neocolonial ties between France and its former colonies.
*[[Herbert Chitepo]], leader of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), was assassinated on March 18, 1975.
*[[Mohamed Bassiri]], leader of the [[Advanced Organization for the Liberation of the Sahara]] (OALS) was &quot;disappeared&quot; in [[El Aaiún]] ([[Western Sahara]]) in 1970, allegedly by the [[Spanish Legion]].
*[[Dulcie September]], leader of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), who was investigating an [[arms trade]] between France and South Africa, was murdered in Paris on March 29, 1988, a few years before the end of the [[apartheid]] regime.
Many of these assassinations are still unsolved cases as of 2010, but foreign power interference is undeniable in many of these cases &amp;mdash; although others were for internal matters. To take only one case, the investigation concerning Mehdi Ben Barka is continuing to this day, and both France and the United States have refused to declassify files they acknowledge having in their possession&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mehdi Ben Barka]] for further information. France has declassified some of the files, but Ben Barka's family has stated that these have shed no new light on the affair, and that further efforts must be done.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenix Program]], a CIA program of [[assassination]] during the [[Vietnam War]], should also be named.

== Post-colonial organizations ==

[[Image:Postempire Orgs Map2.png|right|400px|thumb|Five international organizations whose membership largely follows the pattern of previous colonial empires.]]

Due to a common history and culture, former colonial powers created institutions which more loosely associated their former colonies.  Membership is voluntary, and in some cases can be revoked if a member state loses some objective criteria (usually a requirement for democratic governance).  The organizations serve cultural, economic, and political purposes between the associated countries, although no such organization has become politically prominent as an entity in its own right.

== Differing perspectives ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
There is quite a bit of controversy over decolonisation. The end goal tends to be universally regarded as good, but there has been much debate over the best way to grant full independence.

=== Economic effects ===

==== Effects on the colonizers ====

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] argues that the post–World War II decolonization was brought about for economic reasons. In ''A Journey Through Economic Time'', he writes, &quot;The engine of economic well-being was now within and between the advanced industrial countries. Domestic [[economic growth]] &amp;mdash; as now measured and much discussed &amp;mdash; came to be seen as far more important than the erstwhile colonial trade.... The economic effect in the [[United States]] from the granting of independence to the [[Philippines]] was unnoticeable, partly due to the [[Bell Trade Act]], which allowed American monopoly in the economy of the Philippines. The departure of India and Pakistan made small economic difference in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] economists calculated that the economic effect from the loss of the great Dutch empire in [[Indonesia]] was compensated for by a couple of years or so of domestic post-war economic growth. The end of the colonial era is celebrated in the history books as a triumph of national aspiration in the former colonies and of benign good sense on the part of the colonial powers. Lurking beneath, as so often happens, was a strong current of economic interest &amp;mdash; or in this case, disinterest.&quot;

In general, the release of the colonized caused little economic loss to the colonizers. Part of the reason for this was that major costs were eliminated while major benefits were obtained by alternate means. Decolonization allowed the colonizer to disclaim responsibility for the colonized. The colonizer no longer had the burden of obligation, financial or otherwise, to their colony. However, the colonizer continued to be able to obtain cheap goods and labor as well as economic benefits (see [[Suez Canal Crisis]]) from the former colonies. Financial, political and military pressure could still be used to achieve goals desired by the colonizer. Thus decolonization allowed the goals of colonization to be largely achieved, but without its burdens.

==== Effects on the former colonies ====
{{further2|[[Third World debt]]}}

=== Settled populations ===
Decolonization is not an easy matter in colonies where a large population of settlers lives, particularly if they have been there for several generations. This population, in general, may have to be repatriated, often losing considerable property. For instance, the decolonisation of [[Algeria]] by France was particularly uneasy due to the large European and Sephardic Jewish population (see also ''[[pied noir]]''), which largely evacuated to France when Algeria became independent. In [[Zimbabwe]], former [[Rhodesia]], president [[Robert Mugabe]] has, starting in the 1990s, targeted [[White Africans of European ancestry|white African farmers]] and forcibly seized their property. In some cases, decolonisation is hardly possible or impossible because of the importance of the settler population or where the indigenous population is now in the minority; such is the case of the British population of the [[Cayman Islands]], the Russian population of [[Kazakhstan]], and the immigrant communities of the Americas.

{{Further|List of national independence days}}

In this chronological overview, not every date is indisputably the decisive moment. Often, the final phase, independence, is mentioned here, though there may be years of autonomy before, e.g., as an Associated State under the British crown. For such details, see each national history. 

Furthermore, note that some cases have been included that were not strictly colonized but rather protectorate, co-dominium, lease.... Changes subsequent to decolonization are usually ''not'' included; nor is the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]].
