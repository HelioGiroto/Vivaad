{{History of Canada}}

The '''history of Canada''' covers the period from the arrival of [[Paleo-Indians]] thousands of years ago to the present day. Canada has been inhabited for millennia by distinctive groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]], among whom evolved trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and [[social hierarchies]]. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archaeological]] investigations. Various [[Numbered Treaties|treaties]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal law|laws]] have been enacted between [[Former colonies and territories in Canada|European settlers]] and the Aboriginal populations.

Beginning in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]]. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] to Britain in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[British Empire]], which became official with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and completed in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]].

Over centuries, elements of Aboriginal, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]. Canadian culture has also been strongly influenced by that of its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the Second World War, [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is governed as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].

The [[Hopewell tradition]] is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300 BCE to 500 CE. At its greatest extent, the [[Hopewell Exchange System]] connected cultures and societies to the peoples on the Canadian shores of [[Lake Ontario]].

The [[Eastern Woodlands tribes|eastern woodland areas]] of what became Canada were home to the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] peoples. The Algonquian language is believed to have originated in the western plateau of Idaho or the plains of Montana and moved eastward,&lt;ref&gt;Ives Goddard, 1994. &quot;The West-to-East Cline in Algonquian Dialectology.&quot; In Actes du Vingt-Cinquième Congrès des Algonquinistes, ed.

Lower emphasizes the positive benefits of the Revolution for Americans, making them an energetic people, while for English Canada the results were negative:
:&quot;[English Canada] inherited, not the benefits, but the bitterness of the Revolution. It got no shining scriptures out of it. It got little release of energy and no new horizons of the spirit were opened up. It had been a calamity, pure and simple. And to take the place of the internal fire that was urging Americans westward across the continent there was only melancholy contemplation of things as they might have been and dingy reflection of that ineffably glorious world across the stormy Atlantic. English Canada started its life with as powerful a nostalgic shove backward into the past as the Conquest had given to French Canada: two little peoples officially devoted to counter-revolution, to lost causes, to the tawdry ideals of a society of men and masters, not to the self-reliant freedom alongside of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lower1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Reginald Marsden Lower|title=Canadians in the making: a social history of Canada|url=http://www.questia.com/read/982591/canadians-in-the-making-a-social-history-of-canada|year=1958|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federation emerged from multiple impulses: the British wanted Canada to defend itself; the Maritimes needed railroad connections, which were promised in 1867; British-[[Canadian nationalism]] sought to unite the lands into one country, dominated by the English language and British culture; many French-Canadians saw an opportunity to exert political control within a new largely French-speaking Quebec&lt;ref name=Gwyn/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;323–324&lt;/sup&gt; and fears of possible U.S. expansion northward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heard&quot;/&gt; On a political level, there was a desire for the expansion of responsible government and elimination of the legislative deadlock between Upper and Lower Canada, and their replacement with provincial legislatures in a federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heard&quot;/&gt; This was especially pushed by the liberal [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reform movement]] of Upper Canada and the French-Canadian ''[[Parti rouge]]'' in Lower Canada who favored a decentralized union in comparison to the Upper Canadian Conservative party and to some degree the French-Canadian ''[[Parti bleu]]'', which favored a centralized union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Romney|title=Getting it Wrong: How Canadians Forgot Their Past and Imperiled Confederation|year=1999 |page=78|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7023/is_30/ai_n28817944/|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska boundary dispute]], simmering since the [[Alaska purchase]] of 1867, became critical when gold was discovered in the [[Yukon]] during the late 1890s, with the U.S. controlling all the possible ports of entry.  Canada argued its boundary included the port of [[Skagway]]. The dispute went to arbitration in 1903, but the British delegate sided with the Americans, angering Canadians who felt the British had betrayed Canadian interests to curry favour with the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;D.M.L.FARR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000107|title = Alaska Boundary Dispute|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|year=2009| accessdate = 2010-04-11 | last=D.M.L.

In 1893, legal experts codified a framework of civil and criminal law, culminating in the [[Criminal Code of Canada]].

Laurier signed a reciprocity treaty with the U.S. that would lower tariffs in both directions.

As a result of the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority; it became an independent member of the [[League of Nations]].

Canada refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson1959&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert MacGregor Dawson|title=William Lyon Mackenzie King: 1874-1923|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uy3VAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 March 2012|year=1959|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=401–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of External Affairs (Canada)|Department of External Affairs]], which had been founded in 1909, was expanded and promoted Canadian autonomy as Canada reduced its reliance on British diplomats and used its own foreign service.&lt;ref name=&quot;HillikerCanada1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hilliker|author2=Institute of Public Administration of Canada|title=Canada's Department of External Affairs: The early years, 1909-1946|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MZD0inJnMJQC&amp;pg=PA3|date=February 1990|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-0751-7|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus began the careers of such important diplomats as [[Norman Robertson]] and [[Hume Wrong]], and future prime minister [[Lester Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;John English, ''Shadown of Heaven: The Life of Lester Pearson'', volume one, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 to 1926, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s Liberal government pursued a conservative domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, cooling wartime ethnic tensions, as well as defusing postwar labour conflicts. The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson (1958) ch 14, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, [[Thomas Crerar]], resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid [[Robert Forke]]. The socialist reformer [[J.S. Woodsworth]] gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hutchison, ''The Incredible Canadian'' (1952), pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 Prime Minister Mackenzie King advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng]], to dissolve Parliament and call another election, but Byng refused, the only time that the Governor General has exercised such a power. Instead Byng called upon Meighan, the Conservative Party leader, to form a government. Meighen attempted to do so, but was unable to obtain a majority in the Commons and he, too, advised dissolution, which this time was accepted.  The episode, the [[King-Byng Affair]], marks a constitutional crisis that was resolved by a new tradition of complete non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government.

In 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] gave each dominion (which included Canada and Newfoundland) the opportunity for almost complete legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/federal/1931.htm|title=The Statute of Westminster|publisher=Marianopolis College|first=Claude |last=Bélanger|year=2001|accessdate = 2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Newfoundland never adopted the statute, for Canada the Statute of Westminster has been called its declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Hillmer, ''Statute of Westminster: Canada's Declaration of Independence'', ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' Retrieved 2009-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression===
{{main|Great Depression in Canada}}
[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Unemployed men march in Toronto]]
Canada was hard hit by the worldwide [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929. Between 1929 and 1933, the gross national product dropped 40% (compared to 37% in the US). Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933. Many businesses closed, as corporate profits of $396 million in 1929 turned into losses of $98 million in 1933. Canadian exports shrank by 50% from 1929 to 1933. Construction all but stopped (down 82%, 1929–33), and wholesale prices dropped 30%. Wheat prices plunged from 78c per bushel (1928 crop) to 29c in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Urquhart, ed. ''Historical Statistics of Canada'' (1965) series F1-F13&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban unemployment nationwide was 19%; Toronto's rate was 17%, according to the census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Bureau of the Census, ''Unemployment'' Vol. VI (Ottawa 1931), pp. 1, 267&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices. Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts become heavier as prices fell. Some families saw most or all of their assets disappear, and suffered severely.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression: 1929-1939'' (1990), pp 2-613 is a popular account&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Blair Neatby, ''The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties''(1972), pp 1-162 is a standard scholarly account&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 in the first stage of the long depression, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]  believed that the crisis was a temporary swing  of the business cycle and that the economy would soon recover without government intervention.  He refused to provide unemployment relief or  federal aid to the provinces, saying that if Conservative provincial governments demanded federal dollars he would not give them &quot;a five cent piece.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neatby, ''William Lyon Mackenzie King,'' 2:312, 318&lt;/ref&gt; His blunt wisecrack was used to defeat the Liberals in the 1930 election.  The main issue was the rapid deterioration in the economy and whether the prime minister was out of touch with the hardships of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression, 1929-1939'' (1990) pp 54, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morton, ''Working people'' (1998) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 election]] was [[Richard Bedford Bennett]] and the Conservatives.  Bennett had promised high tariffs and large scale spending, but as deficits increased he became wary and cut back severely on Federal spending. With falling support and the depression only getting worse Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) in the United States, but he got little passed.  Bennett's government became a focus of popular discontent.  For example, auto owners saved on gasoline by using horses to pull their cars, dubbing them [[Bennett Buggy|Bennett Buggies]]. The Conservative failure to restore prosperity led to the return of Mackenzie King's Liberals in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. R. H. Wilbur|title=The Bennett New Deal: Fraud or Portent?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7MJAQAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Copp Clark |pages=78–112, 147–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 the Liberals used the slogan &quot;King or Chaos&quot; to win a landslide in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Blair Neatby, ''William Lyon Mackenzie King: 1932-1939'' (1976) pp 143-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Promising a much-desired trade treaty with the U.S., the Mackenzie King government passed the 1935 Reciprocal Trade Agreement. It marked the turning point in Canadian-American economic relations, reversing the disastrous trade war of 1930-31, lowering tariffs, and yielding a dramatic increase in trade.&lt;ref&gt;Marc T. Boucher, &quot;The Politics of Economic Depression: Canadian-American Relations in the Mid-1930s.&quot; ''International Journal'' 1985-1986 41(1): 3-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst of the Depression had passed by 1935, as Ottawa launched relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] became a [[crown corporation]] in 1936. Trans-Canada Airlines (the precursor to [[Air Canada]]) was formed in 1937, as was the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. In 1938, Parliament transformed the [[Bank of Canada]] from a private entity to a crown corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/about/who-we-are/ |title=Who we are |work=Bank of Canada |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One political response was a highly restrictive immigration policy and a rise in natvism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/readings/CanadaandJewishRefugeesinthe1930s.html Claude Bélanger, &quot;Why did Canada Refuse to Admit Jewish Refugees in 1930s?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Times were especially hard in western Canada, where a full recovery did not occur until the Second World War began in 1939. One response was the creation of new political parties such as the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit movement]] and the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]], as well as popular protest in the form of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The On-to-Ottawa Trek|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/onottawa.html |publisher=The University of Calgary (The Applied History Research Group)|year=1997|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobilisation====
[[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in the Second World War]] began when Canada declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] on September 10, 1939, delaying it one week after Britain acted to symbolically demonstrate independence. The war restored Canada's economic health and its self-confidence, as it played a major role in the Atlantic and in Europe. During the war Canada became more closely linked to the U.S. The Americans took virtual control of the [[Yukon]] in order to build the [[Alaska Highway]], and was a major presence in the British colony of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] with major airbases.&lt;ref&gt;Galen Roger Perras, ''Franklin Roosevelt and the Origins of the Canadian-American Security Alliance, 1933-1945: Necessary, but Not Necessary Enough'' (1998) [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=27381179 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie King — and Canada — were largely ignored by [[Winston Churchill]] and the British government despite Canada's major role in supplying food, raw materials, munitions and money to the hard-pressed British economy, training airmen for the Commonwealth, guarding the western half of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] against German U-boats, and providing combat troops for the invasions of Italy, France and Germany in 1943-45.  The government successfully mobilized the economy for war, with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output. The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly. On the political side, Mackenzie King rejected any notion of a government of national unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Granatstein|title=Canada's war: the politics of the Mackenzie King government, 1939-1945|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dSwkAQAAIAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Canadian federal election, 1940]] was held as normally scheduled, producing another majority for the Liberals.

Building up the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] was a high priority; it was kept separate from Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] Agreement, signed in December, 1939, bound Canada, Britain, New Zealand, and Australia to a program that eventually trained half the airmen from those four nations in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;C.
