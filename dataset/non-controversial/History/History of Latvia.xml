      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57278">{{History of Latvia}}

The '''History of Latvia''' began when the area which is today [[Latvia]] was settled following the end of the [[last glacial period#Weichsel glaciation, in Scandinavia and northern Europe|last glacial period]], around 9000 BC. Ancient [[Balts|Baltic peoples]] appeared during the second millennium BC and four distinct tribal realms in Latvia's territories were identifiable towards the end of the first millennium AD. Latvia's principal river, the [[Daugava River]], was at the head of an important mainland route from the [[Baltic region]] through [[History of Russia#Pre-Slavic inhabitants|Russia]] into [[southern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] used by the [[Viking]]s and later [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Germans|German]] traders.

In the early medieval period, the region's peoples resisted [[christianisation#Middle Ages (7th-15th centuries)|Christianisation]] and became subject to attack in the [[Northern Crusades]]. Today's capital, [[Riga]], founded in 1201 by [[Teutons|Teutonic]] colonists at the mouth of the Daugava, became a strategic base in a papally-sanctioned conquest of the area by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]. It was to be the first major city of the southern Baltic and, after 1282, a principal trading centre in the [[Hanseatic League]]. By the 16th century [[List of Germanic peoples|Germanic]] dominance in the region was increasingly challenged by other powers.

Due to Latvia's strategic location and prosperous city, its territories were a frequent focal point for conflict and conquest between at least four major powers, the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] (later [[Germany]]), the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]]. The longest period of external [[hegemony]] in the modern period began in 1710 when control over Riga switched from Sweden to Russia during the [[Great Northern War]]. Under Russian control, Latvia was in the vanguard of industrialisation and the abolition of [[serfdom]] so that by the end of the 19th century it had become one of the most developed parts of the [[Russian Empire]]. The increasing social problems and rising discontent which this brought meant that Riga also played a leading role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]].

A rising sense of [[Latvian National Awakening|Latvian nationalism]] from the 1850s onwards bore fruit after [[World War I]] when, after two years of struggle in the [[Russian Civil War]], Latvia finally won sovereign [[independence]] recognised by Russia in 1920 and by the international community in 1921. Latvia's independent status was interrupted at the outset of [[World War II]] when in 1940 the country was forcibly incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]], invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1941, then retaken by the Soviets in 1944 after Germany surrendered.

From the mid-1940s the country was subject to Soviet economic control and saw considerable [[Russification]] of its peoples, but Latvian culture and infrastructures survived such that, during the period of Soviet liberalisation under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Latvia once again took a path towards independence which eventually succeeded in August 1991 and was recognised by Russia the following month. Since then, under restored independence, Latvia has become a member of the [[United Nations]], entered [[NATO]] and joined the [[European Union]].

== Prehistory ==
[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|Baltic Tribes, about 1200 CE.]]
{{Main|Bandava|Jersika|Metsepole|Piemare|Principality of Koknese|Tālava}}
The proto-[[Balts|Baltic]] forefathers of the [[Latvian people]] have lived on the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] since the third millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/msr/Ethno/dategen1.html Data: 3000 BC to 1500 BC - The Ethnohistory Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of this era the territory known today as [[Latvia]] became famous as a trading crossroads. The famous &quot;route from the [[Viking]]s to the [[Greeks]]&quot; mentioned in ancient chronicles stretched from [[Scandinavia]] through Latvian territory via the [[Daugava River]] to the ancient [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] and [[Byzantine Empire]].

The ancient Balts of this time actively participated in the trading network. Across the European continent, Latvia's coast was known as a place for obtaining [[amber]]. Up to and into the [[Middle Ages]] amber was more valuable than gold in many places. Latvian amber was known in places as far away as [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Amber Road]] was intensively used for the transfer of amber to the south of Europe. In the 10th century, the ancient Balts started to form specific tribal realms. Gradually, five individual Baltic tribal cultures developed: [[Curonians]], [[Livonian people|Livonians]], [[Latgalians]], [[Selonians]], [[Semigallians]] ({{lang-lv|kurši, līvi, latgaļi, sēļi, zemgaļi}}). The largest of them was the Latgallian tribe, which was the most advanced in its socio-political development. The main Latgallian principality was [[Jersika]], ruled by the Greek Orthodox princes from Latgallian-[[Polotsk]] branch of [[Rurik]] dynasty. The last ruler of Jersika, mentioned in the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] was prince Visvaldis (''Vissewalde, rex de Gercike''). During dividing of his realm in 1211 part of the country was called &quot;Latvia&quot; (''terra, quae Lettia dicitur''), probably the first time this name is mentioned in written sources. In contrast, the Couronians maintained a lifestyle of intensive invasions that included looting and pillaging. On the west coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], they became known as the &quot;Baltic Vikings&quot;. But Selonians and Semgallians, closely related to [[Aukštaitians]] and [[Samogitians]], were known as peace-loving and prosperous farmers. [[Livonian people|Livonians]] lived along the shores of the [[Gulf of Riga]] and were fishers and traders.

==German period (1207-1561)==

[[Image:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|thumb|[[Terra Mariana|Medieval Livonia]] in 1260.]]
Because of its strategic geographic location,{{Who|date=May 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Latvian territory has always been invaded by other larger nations, and this situation has defined the fate of Latvia and its people.

At the end of the 12th century, Latvia was more often visited by traders from Western Europe who set out on trading journeys along Latvia's longest river, the Daugava, to Russia. At the very end of the 12th century, [[Germans|German]] traders arrived and with them came preachers of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith who attempted to convert the [[paganism|pagan]] Baltic and [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] tribes to the Christian faith. The Livs did not willingly convert to the new and different beliefs and practices, and particularly opposed the ritual of [[baptism]]. News of this reached the [[Pope]] in Rome and it was decided that [[Northern Crusades|Crusaders]] would be sent into Latvia to influence the situation.

The Germans founded [[Riga]] in 1201, and gradually it became the largest city in the Southern part of the Baltic Sea. [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Order of the Sword Brothers]] was founded in 1202 to subjugate the local people. The Livs were conquered by 1207 and the most of Latgalians by 1214. But the Sword Brothers were defeated in [[Battle of Saule]] (1236) and its remnants accepted incorporation into the [[Teutonic Order]]. By the end of 13th century also the Curonians and Semigallians were subjugated and the development of separate tribal realms of the ancient Latvians came to an end.

In the 13th century, an ecclesiastical state [[Terra Mariana]] or Livonia was established under the Germanic authorities consisting of Latvia and [[Estonia]]. In 1282, Riga and later [[Cēsis]], [[Limbaži]], [[Koknese]] and [[Valmiera]] were included in the Northern German Trading Organisation, or the [[Hanseatic League]] (Hansa). From this time, Riga became an important point in west-east trading. Riga, being the centre of the Eastern Baltic region, formed close cultural contacts with [[Western Europe]].

The [[reformation]] reached Livonia in 1521. It was supported in particular in the cities and by the middle of 15th century the majority of the population had already converted to [[Lutheranism]].

In the 15-16th century the hereditary landed class gradually evolved from vassals of the Order and the bishops. In the time their descendants came to own vast estates over which they exercised absolute rights. The titled landowners wielded immense economic power and for all that they had a duty to care for the peasants dependent of them, in pactice the latter sank into [[serfdom]].

==Lithuanian-Polish and Swedish period (1561-1795)==

=== Livonian War 1558-1583 ===
{{Main|Livonian War}}
[[Image:Europe 1550.jpg|thumb|[[Europe]], 1550.]]
In September 1557 Livonian Confederation and [[Polish–Lithuanian union]] signed the [[Treaty of Pozvol]], which created a mutual defensive and offensive alliance. The tsar of [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] [[Ivan the Terrible]] regarded this as ''[[casus belli]]'' and in January 1558 reacted with the invasion of Livonia. On 2 August 1560 forces of Ivan the Terrible defeated the united forces of the Livonian Order and [[Archbishopric of Riga|Archibishop of Riga]] at the [[Battle of Ērģeme]]. 

The same year, the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek|prince-bishop of Ösel-Wiek]] and [[Bishopric of Courland|Courland]] [[Johannes V von Münchhausen]] sold his lands to king [[Frederick II of Denmark]] for 30,000 [[thalers]]. To avoid hereditary partition of his lands, King Frederick II gave that territory to his younger brother [[Magnus von Lyffland|Magnus]] on condition that he renounced his rights to succession in the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. The chances for success of Magnus and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 (and 1570). In the former case he had been [[Recognition (international law)|recognised]] as their [[sovereignty|sovereign]] by The Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek and The Bishopric of Courland, and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of The [[Bishopric of Dorpat]]; The [[Bishopric of Reval]] with the [[Harju County|Harrien]]-[[Virumaa|Wierland]] [[gentry]] were on his side; Livonian Order conditionally recognised his right of ownership of [[Principality of Estonia]]. Then along with [[Archbishop]] [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] of The Archbishopric of Riga and his [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor]] [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch|Christoph von Mecklenburg]], Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of The [[Kingdom of Livonia]], which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] became king he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with Russia and spoke to the [[Burgess (title)|burghers]] of [[Tallinn|Reval]] city. He offered them goods to submit to him as well as threatening them. By June 6, 1561 they submitted to him contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess [[Catherine Jagellon of Poland|Catherine Jagiellon]]. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to [[Finland]], Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of Riga. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his inheritance of Holstein. After Sweden occupied Reval, Frederick II of Denmark made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on August 7, 1562 in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and The [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between The [[Free City of Lübeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. 

In 1561 the weakened Livonian Order was dissolved by the [[Treaty of Vilnius (1561)|Treaty of Vilnius]]. Its lands were secularised as the [[Duchy of Livonia]] and assigned to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] as a part of it and the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] as a vassal state. The last Master of the order [[Gotthard Kettler]] became the first Duke of Courland, in doing so converting to Lutheranism.

While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568 Erik XIV became insane and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Russia. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], know that he was ready for peace. On December 15, 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to The Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the Livonian War a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called &quot;[[Peace Party]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}}&quot;. Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with Ivan the Terrible, proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.

The Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces – scattered bands of household troops (''[[Hofleute]]'') under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 ([[Battle of Pärnu, 1565]] and [[Siege of Reval, 1565]]), in 1570–1571 ([[Siege of Reval, 1570-1571]]; 30 weeks), and in 1574–1576 (first on Sweden’s side, then came the sale of [[Wiek]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}} to the [[Danish monarchy|Danish Crown]], and the loss of the territory to the Tsardom of Russia. In 1575 after Russians attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition as well as the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Russia obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Rzeczpospolita]]. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

=== Kingdom of Livonia 1570-1578 ===
{{Main|Kingdom of Livonia}}

On June 10, 1570 the Danish [[Duke Magnus of Holstein]] arrived in Moscow where he was crowned King of Livonia. Magnus took the oath of allegiance to [[Ivan the Terrible]] as his overlord and received from the corresponding charter for the vassal kingdom of Livonia in what Ivan termed his patrimony. The armies of Ivan the Terrible were initially successful, taking [[Polotsk]] (1563) and [[Pärnu|Parnawa]] (1575) and overrunning much of Grand Duchy of Lithuania up to [[Vilnius]]. Eventually, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland formed [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569 under the [[Union of Lublin]]. [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] did not like this and The [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between [[Free City of Lübeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] and [[Magnus von Lyffland]] of [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek|Œsel-Wiek]] were not faring well. But in 1569 Erik XIV became [[insanity|insane]] and his brother [[John III of Sweden]] took his place. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus|Zygmunt II August]], know that he was ready for peace. On December 15, 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded.

[[Image:Livland 15jh.png|thumb|Livonia, as shown in the map of 1573 of [[Joann Portantius]].]]
In the next phase of the conflict, in 1577 Ivan IV took opportunity of the Commonwealth internal strife (called the war against [[Gdańsk]] in Polish historiography), and during the reign of [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stefan Batory]] in Poland invaded Livonia, quickly taking almost the entire territory, with the exception of [[Riga]] and [[Tallinn|Rewel]]. In 1578 [[Magnus of Livonia]] [[Recognition (international law)|recognized]] the [[sovereignty]] of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (not [[Ratification|ratified]] by the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] of Poland-Lithuania, or recognized by Denmark). The Kingdom of Livonia was beaten back by Muscovy on all fronts. In 1578 Magnus of Livonia retired to The [[Bishopric of Courland]] and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

Having rejected peace proposals from its enemies, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when [[Crimean Khanate]] devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down [[Moscow]] (see [[Russo-Crimean Wars]]), the [[drought]] and [[epidemic]]s have fatally affected the economy, [[Oprichnina]] had thoroughly disrupted the government, while The [[Grand Principality of Lithuania]] [[Union of Lublin|had united with]] The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)]] and acquired an energetic leader, [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stefan Batory]], supported by [[Ottoman Empire]] (1576). Stefan Batory replied with a series of three [[offensive (military)|offensives]] against Russia, trying to cut The [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Russian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook [[Polotsk]], during the second, in 1580, with 29,000-strong army he took [[Velikiye Luki]], and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the [[Siege of Pskov]]. [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II of Denmark and Norway]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike [[Sweden]] and Poland. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden|John III]] in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish–Lithuanian control of [[Duchy of Livonia|Ducatus Ultradunensis]] only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]] died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of [[inheritance]]. Except for the island of [[Œsel]], [[Denmark]] was out of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] by 1585. As of 1598 [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] was divided onto:
* [[Wenden Voivodeship]] (''województwo wendeńskie'', [[Kieś]])
* [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] (''województwo dorpackie'', [[Dorpat]])
* [[Parnawa Voivodeship]] (''województwo parnawskie'', [[Parnawa]])

===Duchy of Courland and Semigallia 1562-1795===
{{Main|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia}}

In the 17th century, the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, once a part of Livonia, experienced a notable economic boom. During the reign of the duke [[Jacob Kettler]] new copper and iron foundries, gunpowder mills and shipyards were opened. In [[Ventspils]] alone 120 ships were built, of which over 40 were warships. The duchy owned large fleet and established two [[Courland colonization|colonies]] — [[Kunta Kinteh Island|St. Andrews Island]] in the estuary of [[Gambia River]] (in [[Africa]]) and [[Tobago]] Island (in the [[Caribbean Sea]]). Names from this period still survive today in these places.

===Swedish Livonia 1629-1721===
{{Main|Swedish Livonia}}

During the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629)]] Riga and the largest part of Duchy of Livonia came under [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule in 1621. During the Swedish rule Vidzeme was known as the &quot;Swedish Bread Basket&quot; because it supplied the larger part of the Swedish Kingdom with wheat. The rest of Latvia stayed Polish until the second partition of Poland in 1793, when it became Russian.

In 1632 the Swedish king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] founded [[Dorpat University]] which became the intellectual focus for population of Livonia. The translation of the whole Bible into Latvian in 1685 by [[Johann Ernst Glück]] was subsidized by the Swedish government. Also the schools for Latvian speaking peasantry were set up in the country parishes.  

Riga was the second largest city in the Swedish Empire at the time. Together with other Baltic Sea dominions, Livonia served to secure the Swedish ''[[Dominium maris baltici]]''. In contrast to Swedish Estonia, which had submitted to Swedish rule voluntarily in 1561 and where traditional local laws remained largely untouched, the [[uniformity policy]] was applied in Swedish Livonia under [[Karl XI]] of Sweden: serfdom was abolished in the estates owned by the Swedish crown, peasants were offered education and military, administrative or ecclesiastical careers, and nobles had to transfer domains to the king in the [[Great Reduction]]. These reforms were subsequently reversed by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] of Russia when he conquered Livonia.

===Inflanty Voivodeship 1629-1772===
{{Main|Inflanty Voivodeship}}

After the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) only the Southeastern part of the Duchy of Livonia ramained under Polish-Lithuanian rule. The Catholicism became the dominant religion in this territory known as Inflanty or Latgale as a result of Counter-Reformation.

{{Main|Governorate of Livonia|Courland Governorate}}

In 1700, the [[Great Northern War]] broke out. The course of this war was directly linked with today's Latvian territory and the territorial claims of the [[Russian Empire]]. One of its goals was to secure the famous and rich town of Riga. In 1710, the Russian Tsar, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], managed to secure Vidzeme. Through Vidzeme to Riga, Russia obtained a clear passage to Europe. By the end of the 18th century, due to the [[Partitions of Poland]], all of Latvia's territory was under Russian rule.

In 1812 [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] troops [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] and the Prussian units under the leadership of the field marshal [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]] occupied Courland and approached Riga. The governor-general of Riga [[Ivan Essen]] set the wooden houses of the Riga suburbs on fire to deflect the invaders and thousands of city residents were left homeless. However York did not attack Riga and in December the Napoleon's army retreated.

[[Serfdom]] was abolished in [[Courland Governorate]] in 1818 and [[Governorate of Livonia]] in 1819. However all the land stayed in the hands of nobility. Only in 1849, a law granted a legal basis for the creation of peasant-owned farms. Reforms were slower in [[Latgalia|Latgale]] which was part of Vitebsk Governorate, where serfdom was only abolished in 1861 after [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|emancipation reform]]. In the middle of 19th century industry developed quickly and the number of the inhabitants grew. Courland and Vidzeme became one of Russia's most developed provinces.

In the 19th century, the first [[Latvian National Awakening]] began among ethnic Latvian intellectuals, a movement that partly reflected similar [[nationalist]] trends elsewhere in Europe. This revival was led by the &quot;[[Young Latvians]]&quot; (in Latvian: ''jaunlatvieši'') from the 1850s to the 1880s. Primarily a literary and cultural movement with significant political implications, the Young Latvians soon came into severe conflict with the [[Baltic Germans]].

In the 1880s and 1890s the [[russification]] policy began by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was aimed at reducing the autonomy of [[Baltic governorates|Baltic provinces]] and the introduction of the Russian language in administration, court and education replacing German or Latvian (in regard to schools).

With increasing pauperization in rural areas and growing urbanization, a loose but broad leftist movement called the &quot;[[New Current]]&quot; arose in the late 1880s. Led by [[Rainis]] and [[Pēteris Stučka]], editors of the newspaper ''Dienas Lapa'', this movement was soon influenced by [[Marxism]] and led to the creation of the [[Latvian Social Democratic Labour Party]].

Latvia in the 20th century saw an explosion of popular discontent in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]].

=== 1905 Revolution ===
{{Main|Russian Revolution in 1905}}
Following the shooting of demonstrators in [[St. Petersburg]] on January 9 a wide-scale general strike began in Riga. On January 13 Russian army troops opened fire on demonstrators in Riga killing 73 and injuring 200 people. During the summer 1905 main revolutionary events moved to the countryside. 470 new parish administrative bodies were elected in 94% of the parishes in Latvia. The Congress of Parish Representatives was held in Riga in November. Mass meetings and demonstrations took place including violent attacks against [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] nobles, burning estate buildings and seizure of estate property including weapons. In the autumn 1905 armed conflict between the German nobility and the Latvian peasants begun in the rural areas of Vidzeme and Courland. In Courland, the peasants seized or surrounded several towns. In Livland the fighters controlled the Rūjiena-Pärnu railway line. Altogether, a thousand armed clashes were registered in Latvia in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina| coauthors = Ilgvars Butulis; Antonijs Zunda; Aivars Stranga; Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 68| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martial law was declared in Courland in August 1905 and in Livland in late November. Special punitive expeditions were dispatched in mid-December to suppress the movement. They executed 1170 people without trial or investigation and burned 300 peasant homes. Thousands were exiled to [[Siberia]]. In 1906 the revolutionary movement gradually subsided.

=== German occupation World War I ===
{{Main|Ober Ost}}
On August 1, 1914 [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on Russia and by 1915, the conflict reached Latvia. On May 7 the Germans captured [[Liepāja]] and on May 18, [[Talsi]], [[Tukums]] and [[Ventspils]]. On June 29 Russian Supreme Command ordered to evacuate whole population from [[Courland|Kurzeme]] and around 400,000 refugees fled to the east. Some of them settled in [[Vidzeme]] but most continued their way to Russia. On July 19 Russian War Minister ordered to evacuate the factories of Riga together with their workers. In the summer of 1915, 30,000 railway wagons loaded with machines and equipment from factories were taken away. In August the formation of Latvian battalions known as [[Latvian Riflemen]] started. From 1915 to 1917, the Riflemen fought in the Russian army against the Germans in positions along [[Daugava River]]. In December 1916 and January 1917, they suffered heavy casualties in month-long [[Christmas Battles]]. In February 1917 [[February Revolution|Revolution]] broke out in Russia and in the summer the Russian army collapsed. The German offensive was successful and on 3 September 1917 they entered Riga. In November 1917, the Communist [[Bolshevik]]s took power in Russia. The Bolshevik government tried to end the war and in March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed which gave Kurzeme and Vidzeme to the Germans. By February the Germans had occupied all of Latvia. However after the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]], on 11 November the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice treaty]] between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and Germany was signed thus ending [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=mangulis&gt;Mangulis, Visvaldis.

The idea of an independent Latvia became a reality at the beginning of the 20th century. The course of World War I activated the idea of independence. World War I directly involved Latvians and Latvian territory. [[Latvian riflemen]] (''latviešu strēlnieki'') fought on the Russian side during this war, and earned recognition for their bravery far into Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922), Latvians fought on both sides with a significant group (known as [[Latvian Riflemen|Latvian red riflemen]]) supporting the [[Bolshevik]]s. In the autumn of 1919 the red Latvian division participated in a major battle against the &quot;white&quot; anti-bolshevik army headed by the Russian general [[Anton Denikin]].

Latvia was ostensibly included within the proposed [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]]-led [[United Baltic Duchy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estonica.org/eng/lugu.html?menyy_id=655&amp;kateg=43&amp;alam=80&amp;leht=3 The Story of the Estonian Republic — 1918–1940] Estonica.org&lt;/ref&gt; but this attempt collapsed after the defeat of the [[German Empire]] in November 1918. The post-war confusion was a suitable opportunity for the development of an independent nation. Latvia proclaimed independence shortly after the end of World War I – on November 18, 1918 which is now the ''Independence Day'' in [[Latvia]].

A series of conflicts within the territory of Latvia during 1918–1920 is commonly known as the [[Latvian War of Independence]]. In December 1918 [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] invaded the new republic and rapidly conquered almost all the territory of Latvia, Riga itself was captured by the Soviet Army on 4 April 1919, with the exception of a small territory near [[Liepāja]]. The [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] was proclaimed on 17 December 1918 with the political, economic, and military backing of the Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia. On March 3, 1919 [[Freikorps in the Baltic|German]] and Latvian forces commenced a counterattack against the forces of Soviet Latvia. On 22 May 1919 Riga was recaptured. In June 1919 collisions started between the ''[[Baltische Landeswehr]]'' on one side and the [[Military of Estonia|Estonian]] 3rd division on the other.&lt;ref name=maide&gt;{{cite book|title=Ülevaade Eesti Vabadussõjast (1918–1920) (Overview on Estonian War of Independence)|language=Estonian|author=Colonel Jaan Maide|url=http://www.ksk.edu.ee/file.php?ID=1207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd division defeated the German forces in the [[Battle of Cesis (1919)|Battle of Wenden]] on June 23. An armistice was signed at Strazdumuiža, under the terms of which the Germans had to leave Latvia.&lt;ref name=maide/&gt; However the German forces instead of leaving, were incorporated into the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]].&lt;ref name=maide/&gt; On October 5 it commenced an offensive on Riga taking the west bank of the [[Daugava River]] but on November 11 was defeated by Latvian forces and by the end of the month, driven from Latvia. On January 3, 1920 the united Latvian and Polish forces launched an attack on the Soviet army in [[Latgalia]] and took [[Daugavpils]]. By the end of January they reached the etnographic border of Latvia. On August 11, 1920 according to the [[Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty]] (&quot;Treaty of Riga&quot;) Soviet Russia relinquished authority over the Latvian nation and claims to Latvian territory &quot;once and for all times&quot;.

The international community ([[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]) recognized Latvia's independence on January 26, 1921, and the recognition from many other countries followed soon. In this year Latvia also became a member of the [[League of Nations]] (September 22, 1921).

In April 1920 elections to the [[Constituent assembly]] were held. In May 1922 the [[Constitution of Latvia]] and in June the new Law on Elections were passed, opening the way to electing the parliament- [[Saeima]]. At Constituent Assembly, the law on the land reform was passed, which expropriated the manor lands. Landowners were left with 50 hectares each and their land was distributed to the landless peasants without cost. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%. The extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level already in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina| coauthors = Ilgvars Butulis; Antonijs Zunda; Aivars Stranga; Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 195| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[Great Depression|world economic crisis]] there was a growing dissatisfaction among the population at the beginning of the 1930s. In Riga on May 15, 1934, Prime Minister [[Kārlis Ulmanis]], one of the fathers of Latvian independence, took power by a bloodless coup d'état: the activities of the parliament (the [[Saeima]]) and all the political parties were suspended.

Rapid economic growth took place in the second half of 1930s, due to which Latvia reached one of the highest living standards in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Expand section

=== Soviet Occupation ===
{{Main|Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940}}
The Soviet Union guaranteed its interests in the Baltics with the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] on August 23, 1939. Under threat of invasion,{{#tag:ref|Soviet-Latvian negotiations started on 2 October 1939 and on the following day Latvia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vilhelms Munters informed his government that Josif Stalin had said that &quot;as for the Germans, [there is no obstacle], we can occupy you&quot; and threatened that the USSR could also seize &quot;territory with a Russian minority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Dr. hab.hist.

Following the initiative from Nazi Germany, Latvia on October 30, 1939 concluded an agreement to repatriate ethnic Germans in the wake of the impeding Soviet takeover.

Seven months later, the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]  accused the Baltic states of conspiracy against the Soviet Union.  On June 16, 1940, threatening an invasion,{{#tag:ref|and presenting the ultimatum and accusations of violation by Latvia of the terms of mutual assistance treaty of 1939, Molotov issued an overt threat to &quot;take action&quot; to secure compliance with the terms of ultimatum – see report of Latvian Chargé d'affaires, Fricis Kociņš, regarding the talks with soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = I.Grava-Kreituse, I.Feldmanis, J.Goldmanis, A.Stranga.  | title = Latvijas okupācija un aneksija 1939-1940: Dokumenti un materiāli.

Staged elections were held July 14–15, 1940, whose results were announced in Moscow 12 hours before the polls closed; Soviet documents show the election results were forged. The newly elected &quot;People's Assembly&quot; declared Latvia a Socialist Soviet Republic and applied for admission into the [[Soviet Union]] on July 21. Latvia was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]] on August 5, 1940. The overthrown Latvian government [[Latvian diplomatic service|continued to function in exile]] while the republic was under the Soviet control.

In the spring of 1941, the Soviet central government began planning the mass deportation of anti-Soviet elements from the occupied Baltic states. In preparation, General [[Ivan Serov]], Deputy [[People's Commissariat for State Security|People's Commissar of Public Security]] of the Soviet Union, signed the [[Serov Instructions]], &quot;Regarding the Procedure for Carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.&quot; During the night of 13–14 June 1941, 15,424 inhabitants of Latvia — including 1,771 Jews and 742 [[History of Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]] — were deported to [[Gulag|camps]] and [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]], mostly in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Elmārs Pelkaus |title= Aizvestie: 1941. gada 14. jūnijā |year= 2001 |publisher= Latvijas Valsts arhīvs; Nordik |location= Riga |language= Latvian, English, and Russian |isbn= 9984-675-55-6 |oclc= 52264782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 35,000 people were deported in the first year of Soviet occupation (131,500 across the Baltics).

The Nazi invasion, launched a week later, cut short immediate plans to deport several hundred thousand more from the Baltics. Nazi troops occupied Riga on July 1, 1941. Immediately after the installment of [[Germany|German]] authority, a process of eliminating the [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Gypsy]] population began, with many killings taking place in [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]]. The killings were committed by the [[Einsatzkommando|Einsatzgruppe A]], the [[Wehrmacht]] and Marines (in [[Liepāja]]), as well as by Latvian collaborators, including the 500-1,500 members of the infamous [[Arajs Kommando|Arajs Commando]] (which alone killed around 26,000 Jews) and the 2,000 or more Latvian members of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HIL_EZ&quot;&gt;[[Andrew Ezergailis|Ezergailis, A.]] The Holocaust in Latvia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://motlc.learningcenter.wiesenthal.org/text/x14/xm1411.html Simon Wiesenthal Center Multimedia Learning Center Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1941 almost the entire Jewish population was killed or placed in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In addition, some 25,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria and the present-day Czech Republic, of whom around 20,000 were killed. The Holocaust claimed approximately 85,000 lives in Latvia,&lt;ref name=&quot;HIL_EZ&quot; /&gt; the vast majority of whom were Jews.

A large number of Latvians resisted the German occupation. The resistance movement was divided between the pro-independence units under the [[Latvian Central Council]] and the pro-Soviet units under the [[Latvian partisans|Latvian Partisan Movement Headquarters]] (Латвийский штаб партизанского движения) in [[Moscow]]. Their Latvian commander was [[Arturs Sproģis]]. The Nazis planned to Germanise the Baltics after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIL_EZ&quot; /&gt; In 1943 and 1944 [[Latvian Legion|two divisions]] of [[Waffen-SS]] were formed from Latvian conscripts and volunteers to help Germany against the [[Red Army]].

==Soviet era==
{{Main|Occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union 1944-1945}}
In 1944, when the Soviet military advances reached the area heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended with another German defeat. Riga was re-captured by the Soviet Red Army on 13 October 1944. During the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's &quot;live resources&quot;. In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control and [[Latvian national partisans]] began their fight against another occupier – the [[Soviet Union]]. 160,000 Latvian inhabitants took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to the Germany and Sweden. The first post-war years were marked by particularly dismal and sombre events in the fate of the Latvian nation. On March 25, 1949, 43,000 rural residents (&quot;[[kulak]]s&quot;) and Latvian patriots (&quot;nationalists&quot;) were deported to Siberia in a sweeping repressive [[Operation Priboi]] in all three Baltic States, which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on January 29, 1949. All together 120,000 Latvian inhabitants were imprisoned or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the [[Gulag]]). Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans.
[[Image:Flag of Latvian SSR.svg|250px|thumb|[[Flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Flag of the Latvian SSR]].]]
In the post-war period, Latvia was forced to adopt Soviet farming methods and the economic infrastructure developed in the 1920s and 1930s was eradicated. Rural areas were forced into [[collectivisation]]. The massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 persons arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina| coauthors = Ilgvars Butulis; Antonijs Zunda; Aivars Stranga; Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 418| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive programme to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in favor of Russian. All of the minority schools ([[Jews|Jewish]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Estonians|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]]) were closed down leaving only two languages of instructions in the schools- Latvian and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina| coauthors = Ilgvars Butulis; Antonijs Zunda; Aivars Stranga; Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 411| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian language were taught notably, as well as Russian literature, music and history of Soviet Union (actually- history of Russia).

On 5 March 1953 [[Joseph Stalin]] died and his successor became [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The period known as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] began but attempts by the national communists led by [[Eduards Berklavs]] to gain a degree of autonomy for the republic and protect the rapidly deteriorating position of the [[Latvian language]] were not successful. In 1959 after Krushchev's visit in Latvia national communists were stripped of their posts and Berklavs was deported to Russia.

Because Latvia had still maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists it was decided in Moscow that some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]], as well as  food and oil processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina| coauthors = Ilgvars Butulis; Antonijs Zunda; Aivars Stranga; Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 379| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories. In order to expand industrial production, more immigrants from other Soviet republics were transferred into the country, noticeably decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians.

By 1989, the ethnic Latvians comprised about 52% of the population (1,387,757), compared to a pre-war proportion of 77% (1,467,035). In 2005 there were 1,357,099 ethnic [[Latvian people|Latvians]], showing a real decrease in the titular population. Proportionately, however, the titular nation already comprises approximately 60% of the total population of Latvia (2,375,000).

== Restoration of independence ==
&lt;!-- Secession talk is legally and factually incorrect, Latvia reestablished its sovereignty --&gt;
[[File:Riga barricade 1991.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Barricade in Riga to prevent the Soviet Army from reaching the Latvian Parliament, July 1991.]]
[[Liberalization]] in the [[communism|communist]] regime began in the mid 1980s in the USSR with the [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] instituted by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. In Latvia, several mass political organizations were constituted that made use of this opportunity –  [[Popular Front of Latvia]] (Tautas Fronte), [[Latvian National Independence Movement]] (Latvijas Nacionālās Neatkarības Kustība) and [[Citizens' Congress of the Republic of Latvia|Citizens' Congress]] (Pilsoņu kongress). These groups began to agitate for the restoration of national independence.

On the 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (August 23, 1989) to the fate of the [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]], [[Latvian people|Latvians]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]] and [[Estonians]] joined hands in a [[human chain]], the [[Baltic Way]], that stretched 600 kilometers from [[Tallinn]], to Riga, to [[Vilnius]]. It symbolically represented the united wish of the [[Baltic States]] for independence.

Subsequent steps towards full independence were taken on May 4, 1990. The [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] [[Supreme Soviet|Supreme Council]], elected in the first democratic elections since the 1930s, adopted a [[declaration On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|declaration restoring independence]] that included a transition period between autonomy within the Soviet Union and full independence. In January 1991, however, pro-communist political forces attempted to restore Soviet power with the use of force. Latvian demonstrators managed to stop the Soviet troops from re-occupying strategic positions ([[January 1991 events in Latvia]]). On August 21, after unsuccessful attempt at a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] in Moscow,  parliament voted for an end to the transition period, thus restoring Latvia's pre-war independence. On September 6, 1991 Latvian independence was once again recognised by the [[Soviet Union]].

==Modern history==
[[File:GW Bush in Riga 2005.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush]], [[Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga]], [[Arnold Rüütel]], and [[Valdas Adamkus]] in [[Riga]], May 7, 2005.]]
Soon after reinstating independence, Latvia, which had been a member of the [[League of Nations]] prior to World War II, became a member of the [[United Nations]]. In 1992, Latvia became eligible for the [[International Monetary Fund]] and in 1994 took part in the [[NATO]] ''[[Partnership for Peace]]'' program in addition to signing the free trade agreement with the [[European Union]]. Latvia became a member of the [[European Council]] as well as a candidate for the membership in the European Union and NATO. Latvia was the first of the three [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]] to be accepted into the [[World Trade Organization]].

At the end of 1999 in [[Helsinki]], the heads of the European Union governments invited Latvia to begin negotiations regarding accession to the European Union. In 2004, Latvia's most important foreign policy goals, membership of the European Union and NATO, were fulfilled. On April 2, Latvia became a member of NATO and on May 1, Latvia, along with the other two Baltic States, became a member of the European Union. Around 67% had voted in favor of EU membership in a September 2003 referendum with turnout at 72.5 percent.
