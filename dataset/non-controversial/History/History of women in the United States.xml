The first European settlement inside what is now United States territory was founded in 1526. In that year a judge from [[Santo Domingo]], [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]], obtained from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I, King of Spain]], a patent authorizing him to make settlements on the mainland of America, and to Christianize the American natives.&lt;ref name=CatholicVirginia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrivernotes.com/va/catholicva.htm|title=The Catholic Church in Virginia|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, with 600 settlers, including women, men, and children, he sailed to America from Puerto de la Plata, San Domingo, with three small vessels.&lt;ref name=CatholicVirginia/&gt; The settlers founded the colony of [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] at what is present-day [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Myrtle Beach Retirement and Real Estate |url=http://www.retirenearmyrtlebeach.com/component/content/article/34-brunswick-county-nc/46-history-of-brunswick-county-nc.html |title=History of Brunswick County NC |publisher=Retirenearmyrtlebeach.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first European settlement in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timepage.org/spl/13colony.html |title=13 Originals |publisher=Timepage.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained the first slaves brought to America, about 100 African people, who eventually staged a rebellion and fled into the forest, where they may have taken refuge with the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wzWG2knfzb0C&amp;pg=PA23 |last=Sharp |first=Pearl S. |last2=Schomp |first2=Virginia |title=The Slave Trade and the Middle Passage |page=23|isbn=978-0-7614-2176-4|date=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, owing to the severity of winter, the hostility of the Native Americans, and internal discord, in the spring of 1527 all the settlers, under the leadership of Francis Gomez, reembarked for Santo Domingo in two of the vessels, one of which sank along with all on board, leaving only 150 of the people alive to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=CatholicVirginia/&gt;

[[Fort Caroline]], the first French colony in the present-day United States, was founded in 1564 in what is today Jacksonville, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybaseguide.com/navy/kings-bay/communities.aspx |title=Military &amp;#124; Kings Bay Nsb &amp;#124; Community |publisher=MyBaseGuide.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FortCaroline&gt;{{cite web|author=Dale Cox |url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/fortcaroline.html |title=Fort Caroline National Memorial - Jacksonville, Florida |publisher=Exploresouthernhistory.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 300 people founded this colony, including four women, 110 sailors, 120 soldiers, some artisans, and some servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NclDpB3Fn5AC&amp;pg=PA120 |title=Florida Almanac 2007-2008 - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=March 31, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UcY20I7XXMAC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Four Centuries of Southern Indians - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1565 the Spanish destroyed the French colony and built their own settlement in nearby St. Augustine, which became the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States. French leader [[Jean Ribault]] had left Fort Caroline virtually undefended, as he sailed in a growing hurricane to challenge the new Spanish presence in St. Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Soergel |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/082408/lif_321895270.shtml |title=Fort Caroline: History buried in mystery |publisher=Jacksonville.com |date=August 24, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French at Fort Caroline had no idea that the Spanish were in the vicinity and were not prepared for this attack.&lt;ref name=FortCaroline/&gt; The Spanish soldiers stormed through the unlocked gates of the fort early on the morning of September 20, 1565, easily capturing the fort and many of its defenders.&lt;ref name=FortCaroline/&gt; It is believed that 40 or 50 of the French men escaped by leaping over the walls or taking refuge on boats in the river. All the French women and children who did not escape (there were about 50) were taken captive, and later shipped to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=FortCaroline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oh39ELdHh2wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kenneth+hidden+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Rr3GTY-wD8TTgAfrmcDMBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22puerto%20rico%22&amp;f=false |title=America's Hidden History: Untold&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 140 or so men in the fort were killed.&lt;ref name=FortCaroline/&gt; St. Augustine was established in 1565, with 800 people founding it, including less than one hundred women (the exact number is unknown), 500 soldiers, 200 sailors, and some married men, children, and officials; all were from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232 |title=The Catholic church in the United&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=April 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English people to arrive in America were the members of the [[Roanoke Colony]]. This colony was established in what is now North Carolina in July 1587, with 17 women, 91 men, and 9 boys as the founding colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eyExLN1prkYC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22nine+boys%22+roanoke+colony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aV_gQ6eLH2&amp;sig=xC-qwRndwcclqWBuBo0CGywbbww&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iqgYTbKyIcWBlAfrtrm4DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nine%20boys%22%20roanoke%20colony&amp;f=false |title=Colonial America and the American&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=June 25, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC Two Worlds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-twoworlds/1638 |title=Fort Raleigh and the Lost Colony - North Carolina Digital History |publisher=Learnnc.org |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 1587, [[Virginia Dare]] was born; she was the first English child born in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC Two Worlds&quot;/&gt; She was the daughter of [[Eleanor Dare|Eleanor]] and [[Ananias Dare]] of the Roanoke colony, who were parishioners of [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's]] and were married in the church, and also had Virginia baptized there.&lt;ref name=VirginiaDare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timelines.com/1587/8/18/birth-of-virginia-dare-first-child-born-in-the-americas |title=Birth of Virginia Dare, First Child Born in the Americas |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bust of Virginia now stands above the baptismal font in the church.&lt;ref name=VirginiaDare/&gt; It is not known what happened to the members of the Roanoke colony; however, it is likely that they were attacked by Native Americans, and those not killed were assimilated into the local tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC Two Worlds&quot;/&gt;

==1600–1700==
[[File:Pocahontas.jpg|thumb|right|Matoaka, better known by her nickname [[Pocahontas]]]]

Matoaka (better known by her nickname &quot;[[Pocahontas]],&quot; meaning &quot;little wanton&quot; or possibly &quot;the naughty one&quot; or &quot;spoiled child&quot;), was born about 1600 to the Native American [[chief Powhatan]].&lt;ref name=Powhatan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powhatan.org/pocc.html |title=The Pocahontas Myth - Powhatan Renape Nation - the real story, not Disney's Distortion |publisher=Powhatan.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powhatan had numerous wives (each wife gave him a single child and then was sent back to her village to be supported by the paramount chief until she found another husband), and thus Matoaka had many half-brothers and half-sisters.&lt;ref name=PowhatansVirginia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyisfun.org/pocahontas-and-the-powhatans-of-virginia.htm |title=Pocahontas and the Powhatans of Virginia |publisher=Historyisfun.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother’s name is unknown.&lt;ref name=PowhatansVirginia/&gt;

The legend that she saved [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] from being clubbed to death by her father in 1607 has no evidence behind it.&lt;ref name=Powhatan/&gt; Smith told the story for the first time seventeen years after it supposedly happened, and Smith also claimed that he was saved from death by a woman on two other occasions.&lt;ref name=Powhatan/&gt; The rescue legend was part of a longer account used as justification to wage war on Powhatan's Nation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Early histories did establish that Matoaka befriended Smith and the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colony. She often went to the settlement and played games with the boys there. When the colonists were starving, &quot;every once in four or five days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought him (Smith) so much provision that saved many of their lives that else for all this had starved with hunger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/smith/smith.html|title=Smith, ''Generall Historie'', p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as the colonists expanded their settlement further, the Virginia Indians felt their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.

Matoaka was taken prisoner by the colonists while she was on a social visit in 1612, when she was seventeen, and was held hostage at Jamestown for over a year, during which time she converted to Christianity and agreed to marry [[John Rolfe]]. This marriage occurred in April 1614, resulting in her being given the name Rebecca Rolfe.&lt;ref name=Powhatan/&gt; She never married John Smith.&lt;ref name=Powhatan/&gt; Little is known about her life while imprisoned, although colonist [[Ralph Hamor]] wrote that she received &quot;extraordinary courteous usage.&quot; Linwood &quot;Little Bear&quot; Custalow, in a 2007 book, asserted that Pocahontas was raped during this time, citing oral tradition handed down over four centuries. However, according to historian [[Helen Rountree]], &quot;Other historians have disputed that such oral tradition survived and instead argue that any mistreatment of Pocahontas would have gone against the interests of the English in their negotiations with Powhatan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C. (December 8, 2010). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Pocahontas_d_1617 &quot;Pocahontas (d. 1617)&quot;]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved March 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matoaka's marriage to John Rolfe was the first recorded [[interracial marriage]] in American history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/family/cruz-berson.html]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage brought a peace between the English colonists and the [[Powhatan]]s, and in 1615 Matoaka gave birth to her first child, Thomas.&lt;ref name=PocahontasMarries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/4/5 |title=Pocahontas marries John Rolfe — History.com This Day in History — 4/5/1614 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matoaka and John Rolfe sailed to England in 1616.&lt;ref name=PocahontasMarries/&gt; Matoaka proved popular with the English gentry, and she was presented at the court of [[King James I]].&lt;ref name=PocahontasMarries/&gt; In March 1617, Matoaka and John prepared to sail back to Virginia.&lt;ref name=PocahontasMarries/&gt; However, the day before they were to leave, Matoaka died, probably of smallpox, and was buried at the parish church of St. George in Gravesend, England.&lt;ref name=PocahontasMarries/&gt;

Jamestown, the first English settlement in America, was established in 1607 in what is now Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1127896220070513 | work=Reuters | title=FACTBOX-Jamestown, first English settlement in America | date=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first women to arrive in Jamestown, Mrs. [[Anne Forrest]] and her fourteen-year-old maid, [[Anne Burras]], arrived in late 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=555CzPsGLDMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152 |title=Jamestown Colony: a political&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1608 Anne Burras married a carpenter and laborer named [[John Laydon]] in the first wedding ceremony held in Jamestown, and in 1609 they had a child named [[Virginia Laydon]] (not to be confused with Virginia Dare), who was the first child born in Jamestown.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=orDbMGpInaQC&amp;pg=PA457 |title=Virginia immigrants and adventurers&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Quarterly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/schools/wmmary/quarterly/v15n1/pg39-41.txt |title=Jamestown Colony: a political&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Quarterly&quot; /&gt; The first American slaves since those in Lucas Vasquez de Allyon's unsuccessful colony in 1526–1527 were brought to Jamestown in 1619.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ScXpRj6su8EC&amp;pg=PA51 |title=Voices of a People's History of the&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were from the Caribbean, and there were twenty of them, including three women.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/africanamerican/index.html |title=Claiming Their Citizenship: African American Women From 1624-2009 |publisher=Nwhm.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1619, 90 young single women from England went to Jamestown to become wives of the men there, with the women being auctioned off for 150&amp;nbsp;pounds of tobacco each (to be paid to the shipping company), as that was the cost of each woman's travel to America.&lt;ref name=&quot;warm ups&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nA2mx68jgTkC&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Voices of a People's History of the&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such women were called &quot;[[tobacco brides]]&quot;. There were many such voyages of women to America for this purpose (the 1619 voyage being the first), with the women promised free passage and [[Dowry|trousseaus]] for their trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rg7-dOq4ZXQC&amp;pg=PA7 |title=America's Women: Four Hundred Years&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 1620, the [[Mayflower]] arrived in America (specifically in what is today [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]), bringing the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandaily.org/document/061121%20The%20Mayflower%20Compact.htm |title=www.americandaily.org |publisher=www.americandaily.org |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 102 people aboard – 18 married women traveling with their husbands, seven unmarried women traveling with their parents, three young unmarried women, one girl, and 73 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gMAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA58 |title=The Mayflower descendant: a&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the married women – [[Elizabeth Hopkins]], [[Susannah White]], and [[Mary Allerton]] – had been in their last [[Pregnancy|trimester]] of pregnancy when the Mayflower left.&lt;ref name=Mayflower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/History/women.php |title=MayflowerHistory.com |publisher=MayflowerHistory.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No women died during the Mayflower's voyage; however, 78% of the women died during their first winter in America, a far higher percentage than for men or children.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; [[Dorothy Bradford]] was the first woman to die, and the only woman who died in the month of December; while many of the men, including her husband, were out exploring on [[Cape Cod]], she accidentally fell off the Mayflower into the waters of Provincetown Harbor.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Only a few of the women's death dates were recorded: [[Rose Standish]] died on January 29, Mary Allerton died on February 25, and [[Elizabeth Winslow]] died on March 24.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Most of the women died in February and March.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; The extremely high mortality rate among women is probably explainable by the fact the men were out in the fresh air, felling trees, building structures and drinking fresh New England water, while the women were confined to the damp and crowded quarters of the Mayflower, where disease would have spread much more quickly.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; The women continued to live on the Mayflower for four months after it docked, while the men built storehouses and living quarters onshore.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Furthermore, many of the sick were probably cared for on board the ship by the women, increasing their exposure to colds and pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt;

Only five women survived their first winter in America, and one of the five survivors, [[Katherine Carver]], died in May, her husband John having died of sunstroke a month earlier.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Therefore, by the time of the first Thanksgiving in autumn 1621, there were only four women from the Mayflower left alive: [[Eleanor Billington]], Elizabeth Hopkins, [[Mary Brewster]], and [[Susanna Winslow]].&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1127/p13s02-lign.html |title=The first Thanksgiving / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=November 27, 2002 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanna Winslow was the widow of William White, who had died the first winter; she remarried to [[Edward Winslow]], whose wife Elizabeth had also died the first winter.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Meanwhile, all of the wives who had been left behind in England were still living.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt; Four of them came on the ship Anne in 1623, had additional children, and raised their families at Plymouth.&lt;ref name=Mayflower/&gt;

In the 1630s [[Anne Hutchinson]] began to hold religious meetings in her home, which attracted the attendance not only of women but of prominent men, including affluent young civil officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/anne-marbury-hutchinson/ |title=Education &amp; Resources - National Women's History Museum |publisher=NWHM |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson’s charisma indeed was so great that it became a threat to the ability of the clergy to govern; this was especially clear when some of her male supporters refused to join the militia in pursuit of Pequot natives.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; The authorities, led by Reverend [[John Winthrop]] (who was also the colony’s governor), first attacked her indirectly by banishing her brother-in-law, a minister who shared her views.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; Hutchinson herself was summoned to trial late in 1637 and also banished, but allowed to remain under house arrest until the end of winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; In March, 1638, she was again brought before the court and formally excommunicated; she and her children soon joined her husband, who had prepared a home for them in the new colony of Rhode Island, which had been founded less than two years earlier by other dissidents exiled from Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; At nearly 47, Anne Hutchinson was once again pregnant and so severely ill that her physical condition had interfered with her ability to defend herself on trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; Her medical problem probably was a gross tumor of the placenta that had killed the fetus she delivered in late summer, but Puritan leadership — who saw all events in theological terms — deemed this “monstrous birth” to have been the judgment of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt; In 1642, at age 51, she took her six children to the Dutch colony that now is New York; however, a year later, disgruntled Algonquians attacked her home, killing everyone but her youngest daughter Susanna, who was taken captive.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwhm.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oAWfCh1PS8MC&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Homework Helpers U.s.

There were two notable firsts for American women in the 1600s. In 1648 [[Margaret Brent]], an English immigrant to the Colony of Maryland, was the first woman in the English North American colonies to appear before a court of the Common Law. Appointed as [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]]'s representative, on January 21, 1648, Brent attended the Provincial Court's assembly to request a voice in the council; she also asked for two votes in its proceedings (one as an independent landowner and the other as Lord Baltimore's attorney.) Governor Thomas Greene refused her request, as the assembly at the time considered such privileges for women to be reserved for queens. Brent left but said that she &quot;Protested against all proceedings ... unless she may be present and have vote as aforesaid.&quot; In 1650 [[Anne Bradstreet|Anne Dudley Bradstreet]] became America's first published poet, with the publication of her book of poetry entitled ''The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-3GPn5EmQPkC&amp;pg=PT1 |title=To My Husband and Other Poems - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=December 21, 2000 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also published in London that same year, making Bradstreet the first female poet ever published in both England and the New World.

In 1655 [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], who was a slave in Virginia, won her freedom in a lawsuit based on her father's status as a free Englishman (her mother was a slave and her father was her mother's owner), helped by the fact that her father had baptized her as Christian in the Church of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UYWs-GQDiOkC&amp;pg=PA223 |title=Women in early America: struggle&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law stating that any child born in the colony would follow the status of its mother, slave or free.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; This was an overturn of a longheld principle of English Common Law, whereby a child's status followed that of the father; it enabled white men who raped slave women to hide the mixed-race children born as a result and removed their responsibility to acknowledge, support, or emancipate those children.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt;

In the small Puritan community of [[Salem Village]], Massachusetts, the [[Salem witch trials]] began in 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Sara Zeglin |url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/history/salem-witch-trials/ |title=The Salem Witch Trials - National Geographic Kids |publisher=Kids.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began when a group of girls ([[Betty Parris]], her cousin [[Abigail Williams]], and several others) gathered in the evenings in the home of Reverend Parris to listen to stories told by one of his slaves, Tituba.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; They also played fortune-telling games, which were strictly forbidden by the Puritans.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; One night, while trying to see the faces of their future husbands in an egg white dropped in a glass of water, one girl believed she saw the shape of a coffin.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; Soon after, the girls began acting strangely, leading the Puritan community to suspect that the girls were victims of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt;

The girls named three townswomen as witches - [[Tituba]], [[Sarah Good]], and [[Sarah Osborne|Sarah Osbourne]]; Tituba confessed to having seen the devil and also stated that there was a coven of witches in the Salem Village area.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; The other two women insisted they were innocent, but were found guilty of practicing witchcraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; As the weeks passed, the affected girls accused other townspeople of torturing them with witchcraft, and some on trial also named others as witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; By the end of the trials in 1693, 24 people had died, some in jail but 19 by hanging, and Giles Corey by being pressed to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; Some of the accused confessed to being witches, but none of those were hanged, only those who maintained their innocence;&lt;ref name=&quot;kids.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; those who were hanged include 13 women and 6 men – Bridget Bishop, George Burroughs, Martha Carrier, Martha Corey, Mary Easty, Sarah Good, Elizabeth Howe, George Jacobs, Sr., Susannah Martin, Rebecca Nurse, Alice Parker, Mary Parker, John Proctor, Ann Pudeator, Wilmott Redd, Margaret Scott, Samuel Wardwell, Sarah Wildes, and John Willard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education/faq.shtml |title=Salem Witch Museum Education - Salem, Massachusetts |publisher=Salemwitchmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical woman in colonial America (that is, America before the Revolutionary War) was expected to spin, sew, preserve food, cook, and clean while caring for her children and perhaps raising chickens and geese.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofquilts.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofquilts.com/earlylife.html |title=New England Goodwives - Life for Colonial Women |publisher=Historyofquilts.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families tended to be large, and childbearing was dangerous to health in those days; so many women died from that and other causes (such as the American climate's effect on their health) that the term &quot;now-wife&quot; was coined to refer to a man's present wife as compared to those that he had previously lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofquilts.com&quot;/&gt; Often women were taught to read so that they could read the Bible, but few learned to write as it was thought that there was no reason a woman should know how to write.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofquilts.com&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, a colonial woman was expected to be subservient to her father until she married and then to her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofquilts.com&quot;/&gt; Ministers often told their congregations that women were inferior to men and more inclined to sin and error.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofquilts.com&quot;/&gt; However, several colonial American women had notable accomplishments that are known to this day. 

The earliest known work of literature by an African American and by a slave, [[Lucy Terry]]'s poem &quot;Bars Fight,&quot; was composed in 1746 and was first published in 1855 in Josiah Holland's &quot;History of Western Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamo.edu/sac/english/bailey/lterry.htm |title=Lucy Terry's &quot; Bars Fight. &quot; Text from San Antonio College LitWeb |publisher=Alamo.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;.

In 1756 [[Lydia Taft|Lydia Chapin Taft]] became the first woman in American history to vote, casting a vote in the local town hall meeting in place of her deceased husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackstonedaily.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstonedaily.com/Journeys/cm-lt.htm |title=Blackstone Valley |publisher=Blackstonedaily.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iwdc.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |title=Blackstone Valley |publisher=Blackstonedaily.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |title=Women in Politics: A Timeline |publisher=International Women's Democracy Center |work=Iwdc.org |accessdate=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She voted that her town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] (in Massachusetts colony) should increase the amount of money sent to help fight the French and Indian war.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackstonedaily.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantcircle.com/directory/MA-Uxbridge |title=Uxbridge coupons for pizza, grocery shopping, restaurants and more |publisher=Merchantcircle.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later voted in two other town hall meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwdc.org&quot;/&gt; Women had the right to vote in some states in early American history, but soon lost it.

Furthermore, women in all states except New Jersey lost the right to vote in 1787 when the Constitutional Convention placed voting qualifications in the hands of the states.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; From 1775 until 1807, the state constitution in New Jersey permitted all persons worth over fifty pounds to vote; free black people and single women therefore had the vote until 1807, but not married women, who could have no independent claim to ownership of fifty pounds (anything they owned or earned belonged to their husbands by law).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/earlyrepublic/cohen.html]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemarie Zagarri]] (2007) argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of woman and created an environment favorable to women’s participation in politics. She asserts that for a brief decade, a &quot;comprehensive transformation in women’s rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;8) For example, the American Revolution produced the idea of &quot;Republican Motherhood&quot;, which was the idea that if the republic of America were to succeed, women must be schooled in virtue so they could teach their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=ushistory.org |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/12d.asp |title=Republican Motherhood |publisher=Ushistory.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the first American academies for women were founded in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women’s rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie Zagarri, ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007). 233 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at least one story of women's participation in the American Revolution, the legend that [[Betsy Ross]] designed or made the first American flag, has no evidence at all behind it, although she was a real person who lived in Philadelphia during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoyingphiladelphia.com/betsy_ross_frequently_asked_questions.html |title=Betsy Ross and the First U.S. Flag – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Enjoyingphiladelphia.com |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a significant portion of the population of the colonies and early United States, especially in the Delaware River Valley, who held cultural or religious views of sex equality.  The [[Quakers|Quaker]] segment of the population held views that all human beings, regardless of sex, age, or race or other characteristics, had the same [[Inner light]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506905-1|pages=490–498|quote=&quot;On the subject of gender, the Quakers had a saying: &quot;In souls, there is no sex.&quot; to g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quaker and Quaker-derived views informed the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, including through the direct influence of some of the [[Framers of the Constitution]], such as [[John Dickinson (politician)]] and [[Thomas Mifflin]], who were either Quakers themselves or came from regions founded or heavily populated with Quakers.

Two notable books published in the late 1700s by American women were ''American Cookery'' and ''[http://www.jsmsociety.com/Gleaner_LXXXVIII.html The Gleaner]''.''American Cookery'', written in 1796 by [[Amelia Simmons]], was the first known cookbook written by an American.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri054.html |title=A First American Cookbook (Imagination): American Treasures of the Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular and was published in many editions, but only four copies of the original 1796 edition are known to have survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc.gov&quot;/&gt; ''[http://www.jsmsociety.com/Gleaner_LXXXVIII.html The Gleaner]'', a three-volume book of political essays and plays published in 1798 by [[Judith Sargent Murray]], was the first self-published book by a woman in America.

During the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806), which was the first overland expedition undertaken by Americans to the Pacific coast and back, the Shoshone woman [[Sacagawea]] was the only woman to accompany the 33 members of the permanent party to the Pacific Ocean and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/lewisandclark/inside/saca.html |title=Lewis and Clark .

In 1821, [[Emma Willard]] founded the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, which was the first American educational institution to offer young women a college education equal to that given to young men.&lt;ref name=&quot;jschell.myweb.uga.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jschell.myweb.uga.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jschell.myweb.uga.edu/history/women/troyfemale.htm |title=Troy Female Seminary |publisher=Jschell.myweb.uga.edu |date=October 16, 2001 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three women in the United States to earn and receive their bachelor's degrees – Mary Hosford (later Fisher), Elizabeth Smith Prall (later Russell), and Mary Caroline Rudd (later Allen) – received them from [[Oberlin College]] in 1841;&lt;ref name=&quot;oberlinheritage.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlinheritage.org/researchlearn/historyfaqs |title=Oberlin History Frequently Asked Questions &amp; Timeline |publisher=Oberlinheritage.org |date=June 17, 1933 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oberlin College had become the first coeducational college in the United States in 1833.&lt;ref name=&quot;oberlinheritage.org&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Oberlin was also the first college to grant a degree to an African-American woman, Mary Jane Patterson, in 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;oberlinheritage.org&quot;/&gt;

Another reform movement women were heavily involved with was the rights of those confined in institutions. [[Dorothea Dix]] was one of the most notable such reformers. Prior to the Civil War's beginning in 1861 (when she became the Union's Superintendent of Female Nurses), she investigated the conditions of many jails, mental hospitals, and almshouses, and presented her findings to state legislatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;www25.uua.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/dorotheadix.html |title=Dorothea Dix |publisher=5.uua.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her work, many hospitals were built, along with additions and improvements made to existing facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;www25.uua.org&quot;/&gt; In contrast to popular attitudes of the time that such things were not necessary, she insisted on a therapeutic setting for the curable insane and a humanely comfortable setting for those regarded as incurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;www25.uua.org&quot;/&gt;

During the Mexican War (1846–1848) Elizabeth Newcom enlisted in Company D of the Missouri Volunteer Infantry disguised as a man, calling herself Bill Newcom.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt; She marched 600&amp;nbsp;miles from Missouri to winter camp at Pueblo, Colorado, before she was discovered to be a woman and discharged.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt; Also, in 1846 Sarah Borginnis resupplied American soldiers with food while they were under fire, and was therefore nicknamed &quot;the heroine of Fort Brown&quot;; then-General Zachary Taylor rewarded her with the rank of brevet colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mjOcyvMwJ48C&amp;pg=PA293 |title=Women's almanac 2002 - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continued to be active in reform movements in the second half of the 19th century.

In the years before the Civil War, [[Harriet Tubman]], a runaway slave herself, freed more than 70 slaves over the course of 13 secret rescue missions to the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsone.com/nation/black-history-month/news-one-staff/the-liberator/ |title=The Liberator |publisher=News One |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in June 1863, Harriet Tubman became the first woman to plan and execute an armed expedition in United States history; acting as an advisory to Colonel James Montgomery and his 300 soldiers, Tubman led them in a raid in South Carolina from Port Royal to the interior, some twenty-five miles up the Combahee River, where they freed approximately 800 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duboislc.net/read/Tubman'sCivilWarCampaign.html |title=Harriet Tubman’s Civil War Campaign |publisher=Duboislc.net |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Sanger]] was an influential campaigner for birth control rights in the 1910s. She originally worked as a visiting nurse in the New York City's tenements and wrote about sex education and women's health.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4847bx.htm |title=Margaret Sanger |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1914, Sanger's articles in &quot;The Woman Radical&quot; brought her a federal indictment for violating the [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]] (which since 1873 had banned birth control devices and information on birth control devices, sexually transmitted diseases, human sexuality, and abortion&lt;ref name=&quot;www-scf.usc.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~nicoleg/history.htm |title=The Birth of The Pill |publisher=Scf.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompting her to flee to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; As soon as the ship left U.S. waters, she cabled a radical publisher in New Jersey to tell them to distribute 100,000 copies of her birth control pamphlet, &quot;Family Limitation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; &quot;. Sanger remained exiled in Europe until late 1915; William Sanger had been arrested and jailed for distributing one copy of &quot;Family Limitation&quot;, and Margaret Sanger returned to face the charges against her.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Personal tragedy intervened when the Sanger's five-year-old daughter died suddenly from pneumonia; public sentiments resulted in dismissal of the charges against Margaret Sanger.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Rather than backing away from controversy, Sanger and her sister [[Ethel Byrne]], also a nurse, opened the first birth control clinic in the United States on October 16, 1916, modeled after those Sanger had seen in Holland.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Nine days later police closed the clinic and arrested Sanger, Byrne, and the clinic's interpreter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Byrne was tried and convicted first, and went on a hunger strike; Sanger was convicted and served 30 days in jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; However, the publicity surrounding Sanger's activities had made [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth control a matter of public debate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;

The campaign for women's suffrage picked up speed in the 1910s. A parade for women's suffrage was held on Monday, March 3, 1913, down Pennsylvania Avenue in America's capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/aw01e/aw01e.html |title=American Women: MARCHING FOR THE VOTE: REMEMBERING THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE PARADE OF 1913 |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffragist and lawyer [[Inez Milholland]] led the parade, clad in a white cape astride a white horse; behind her stretched a long line with nine bands, four mounted brigades, three heralds, about 24 floats, and more than 5,000 marchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, in 1916 Inez was the keynote speaker in a western pro-suffrage tour organized by Alice Paul.&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laconneau.com/womensaffairsInez1.html |title=Laconneau International - Spiritual Study and Meditation for Women |publisher=Laconneau.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between one and two thousand people usually attended Inez’s speeches, which centered on the power of uniting women.&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;/&gt; Though she hid her pernicious anemia, the difficult traveling and speaking schedule made it worse, and she collapsed in October 1916 during her last public appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;/&gt; Inez was carried from the stage, but fifteen minutes later she returned, took a seat, finished her speech, and stayed for a question and answer session.&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;/&gt; That night she went into the hospital, and she died six weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;/&gt; Inez’s last sentence before her collapse became a battle cry for suffragists: “Mr. President, how long must women go on fighting for liberty?”&lt;ref name=&quot;laconneau.com&quot;/&gt;”

In the spring of 1917, shortly after Woodrow Wilson had been inaugurated for his second term as President and war with Germany had been declared, women from the National Woman's Party (founded in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]]) began picketing the White House and the Capitol in support of an amendment that would guarantee women's suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/ballot/womenvote.asp |title=Why Women Should Vote |publisher=snopes.com |date=September 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-June, [[Alice Paul]] had been warned by the chief of police that further demonstrations would lead to arrests, and between June 22 and 26, 27 women were arrested for obstructing traffic, but were released without penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; On June 26 several of the picketers were arrested and charged with obstructing traffic, and confined to the District Jail for three days after refusing to pay a 25 dollar fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; The next series of arrests produced the same penalties; however, on July 14 sixteen women were arrested, tried, and sentenced to 60 days in Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia,&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; where the cells were infested with rats, and the food was infested with mealworms.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, on November 14, 1917, newly convicted suffragists arrived at Occoquan and were waiting in a holding room; what happened to them has come to be known as the &quot;Night of Terror&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; Superintendent Whittaker burst into the room, followed by 15 to 20 guards (the exact number is uncertain) and shouted orders to take the suffragists to their cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; May Nolan, a 73-year-old woman with a lame leg, was literally dragged off by two guards, despite saying that she would go willingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; Dorothy Day had her arm twisted behind her back and was purposefully slammed down twice over the back of an iron bench.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; Dora Lewis was thrown into a cell with such force that she was knocked unconscious, and for several minutes her companions believed that she was dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes.com&quot;/&gt; Alice M.

The amendment passed the Tennessee Senate easily.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; However, as it moved on to the House, vigorous opposition came from people in the liquor industry, who thought that if women got the vote, they would use it to pass Prohibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Distillery lobbyists came to fight the amendment, bringing liquor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; “Both suffrage and anti-suffrage men were reeling through the hall in an advanced state of intoxication,” suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the suffragists thought they could count on a one-vote victory in the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Then the speaker, whom they had counted on as a “yes” for the amendment, changed his mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Yet suddenly, Harry Burn, the youngest member of the House, a 24-year-old &quot;no&quot; vote from East Tennessee, got up and announced that he had received a letter from his mother (Febb Ensminger Burn) telling him to &quot;be a good boy and help Mrs. [Carrie Chapman] Catt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; &quot;I know that a mother’s advice is always the safest for a boy to follow&quot;, Burn said, switching sides, and the amendment was ratified that day, August 18, 1920, officially becoming part of the Constitution when it was signed into law on August 26, 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt calculated that the campaign for women's right to vote had involved 56 referendum campaigns directed at male voters, plus 480 campaigns to get Legislatures to submit suffrage amendments to voters, 47 campaigns to get constitutional conventions to write woman suffrage into state constitutions; 277 campaigns to get State party conventions to include woman suffrage planks, 30 campaigns to get presidential party campaigns to include woman suffrage planks in party platforms and 19 campaigns with 19 successive Congresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

However, women also faced many challenges during this time.

Birth control activism was an important cause in the 1930s. In 1936 [[Margaret Sanger]] helped bring the case of &quot;[[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries|United States v.

[[File:Wendy Welder Richmond Shipyards.jpg|thumb|right|A female welder at the Richmond Shipyards, Richmond, California, in 1943. Women factory workers embodied the &quot;[[Rosie the Riveter]]&quot; ideal.]]

When the United States entered World War II in 1941, 12 million women were already working (making up one quarter of the workforce), and by the end of the war, the number was up to 18 million (one third of the workforce).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/pwro/collection/website/rosie.htm |title=Rosie the Riveter: Women Working During World War II |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while eventually 3 million women worked in war plants, the majority of women who worked during World War II worked in traditionally female occupations, like the service sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; During this time, the &quot;[[Rosie the Riveter]]&quot; concept became popular with working women.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Furthermore, during World War II 350,000 women served in the military, as [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WACS]], [[WAVES]], [[SPARS]], Marines and nurses.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt; More than 60,000 Army nurses served stateside and overseas during World War II; 67 Army nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines in 1942 and were held as POWs for over two and a half years.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt; More than 14,000 Navy nurses served stateside, overseas on hospital ships, and as flight nurses during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt; Five Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese on the island of Guam and held as POWs for five months before being exchanged; a second group of eleven Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines and held for 37 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt;

Over 150,000 American women served in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) during World War II; the Corps was formed in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/wac/wac.htm |title=The Women's Army Corps |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Army WACs computed the velocity of bullets, measured bomb fragments, mixed gunpowder, and loaded shells.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; Others worked as draftswomen, mechanics, and electricians, and some received training in ordnance engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; Later in the war, women were trained to replace men as radio operators on U.S. Army hospital ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Larkspur&quot;, the &quot;Charles A.

Eventually the Air Force obtained 40% of all WACs in the Army; women were assigned as weather observers and forecasters, cryptographers, radio operators and repairmen, sheet metal workers, parachute riggers, link trainer instructors, bombsight maintenance specialists, aerial photograph analysts, and control tower operators.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; Over 1,000 WACs ran the statistical control tabulating machines (the precursors of modern-day computers) used to keep track of personnel records.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; By January 1945 only 50% of AAF WACs held traditional assignments such as file clerk, typist, and stenographer.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; A few Air Force WACs were assigned flying duties; two WAC radio operators assigned to Mitchel Field, New York, flew as crew members on B-17 training flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; WAC mechanics and photographers also made regular flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; Three WACs were awarded Air Medals, including one in India for her work in mapping &quot;the Hump,&quot; the mountainous air route overflown by pilots ferrying lend-lease supplies to the Chinese Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt; One woman died in the crash of an aerial broadcasting plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil&quot;/&gt;

Yet women still occupied a lower position than men in many sectors of American life. In 1957, the National Manpower Council (NMC) at Columbia University published its study, &quot;Womanpower, A Statement by the National Manpower Council with Chapters by the Council Staff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feminist.org/research/chronicles/part1a.html |title=The Feminist Chronicles, 1953-1993 - Part I - &quot;... a passion for the possible&quot; - Feminist Majority Foundation |publisher=Feminist.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a comprehensive look at the experience of women in the labor force, their employment needs, and the implications of both for education, training, and public policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; This NMC analysis called women &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;distinctive&quot; workers and recommended that the Secretary of Labor establish a committee to review &quot;the consequences and adequacy of existing Federal and state laws which have a direct bearing on the employment of women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; But this suggestion was not acted upon by the Eisenhower Administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; In 1959, three landmark books on women were published: &quot;A Century of Struggle&quot; by [[Eleanor Flexner]], the first professional history of the 19th century women's movement, which contained an implicit call to arms; &quot;A Century of Higher Education for American Women&quot; by [[Mabel Newcomer]], which disclosed that the relative position of women in the academic world was in decline; and &quot;Women and Work In America&quot; by Robert Smuts, which drew attention to the fact that &quot;the picture of women's occupations outside the home between 1890 and 1950 had changed in only a few essentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt;

In reaction to such findings, by 1961, President John F. Kennedy was under pressure to establish a President's Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; Esther Peterson, Assistant Secretary of Labor and director of the Women's Bureau, and the highest ranking woman in the Kennedy Administration, wanted such a commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; Along with equal pay legislation, it had long been on the agenda of labor movement women and it was in that movement that Peterson's working career had been concentrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; Another wish of the women's movement, effective birth control, came true as in 1961 the first birth control pill, called Enovid, received FDA approval and went on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/timeline/timeline2.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; The Pill &amp;#124; Timeline |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's organizations, notably the American Association of University Women and Business and Professional Women, had been proposing a women's rights commission for many years; they found a champion in Eleanor Roosevelt, who backed the proposal when she met with Kennedy at the White House after his election.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; The establishment of the Commission may also have been regarded by Kennedy as an expedient way to pay off his political debts to the women who had supported his campaign but were disappointed with his poor record of appointments of women to his administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; There was also a desire to have Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most respected women in the country, associated with the Kennedy Administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; Roosevelt had only reluctantly supported JFK's presidential candidacy after her first choice, Adlai Stevenson, lost the nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt; However, she agreed to be the Chairperson of the President's Commission on the Status of Women, which was held from 1961 until 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminist.org&quot;/&gt;

The Commission's Report, called &quot;The American Woman&quot; and issued in 1963, noted discrimination against women in the areas of education, home and community services, employment, social insurance and taxation, and legal, civil and political rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;wifp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/womensmediach2.html |title=Speaking Out for Equal Rights, Peace and Justice, 1963 Through 1970 |publisher=Wifp.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also recommended continued network-building.&lt;ref name=&quot;wifp.org&quot;/&gt; President Kennedy implemented two Commission recommendations that established an Interdepartmental Committee on the Status of Women and a Citizens' Advisory Council on the Status of Women, composed of twenty private citizens appointed by the President.&lt;ref name=&quot;wifp.org&quot;/&gt; These two groups co-sponsored four national conferences of state commissions on the status of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;wifp.org&quot;/&gt; Another important event of 1963 was the publication of Betty Friedan's influential book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which is often cited as the founding moment of second-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/feb/17/1963/betty-friedan |title=This Week in History - Publication of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; by Betty Friedan &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=February 17, 1963 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book highlighted Friedan's view of a coercive and pervasive post-World War-II ideology of female domesticity that stifled middle-class women's opportunities to be anything but homemakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwa.org&quot;/&gt; Friedan's book is credited with sparking second-wave feminism by directing women's attention to the broad social basis of their problems, stirring many to political and social activism.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwa.org&quot;/&gt;

Also in 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to prohibit pay discrimination because of sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminism.eserver.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feminism.eserver.org/workplace/wages/equal-pay.txt |title=Feminism and Women's Studies: A Working Woman's Guide to Her Rights |publisher=Feminism.eserver.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires the employer to pay equal wages to men and women doing equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, which are performed under similar working conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;feminism.eserver.org&quot;/&gt; Another accomplishment for feminism in 1963 was that feminist activist [[Gloria Steinem]] published her article ''I Was a Playboy Bunny'', a behind the scenes look at the sexist treatment of [[Playboy]] bunnies, which was one of her first major assignments in investigative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/whm/bio/steinem_g.htm |title=Gale - Free Resources - Women's History - Biographies - Gloria Steinem |publisher=Gale.cengage.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several political firsts for women in the 1960s. On November 22, 1963, following the assassination of President Kennedy, federal judge [[Sarah T. Hughes]] administered the Presidential Oath of Office to Lyndon Johnson aboard Air Force One, the only time a woman has done so, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court normally has this honor. 1964 was the first year in which more women voted in a Presidential election than men; more women have voted than men in every Presidential election since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Temkin |url=http://www.votingwomen.org/votingpower.html |title=Education + Participation = Power |publisher=VotingWomen.org |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canow.org/canoworg/2010/08/the-history-of-suffrage-and-women-voters.html]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important advances for women's rights in this decade was not begun by a feminist. On Saturday, February 8, 1964, while the Civil Rights Act was being debated on the House floor, Howard W. Smith of Virginia, Chairman of the Rules Committee and staunch opponent of all civil rights legislation, rose up and offered a one word amendment to Title VII, which prohibited employment discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;uic.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm |title=How &quot;Sex&quot; Got Into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy |publisher=Uic.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed to add &quot;sex&quot; to that one title of the bill in order &quot;to prevent discrimination against another minority group, the women,&quot;.... (110 Cong. Rec., February 8, 1964, 2577).&lt;ref name=&quot;uic.edu&quot;/&gt; This stimulated several hours of humorous debate, later called &quot;ladies day in the House&quot;, before the amendment was passed by a teller vote of
168 to 133.&lt;ref name=&quot;uic.edu&quot;/&gt; Howard W. Smith later confessed to his colleague, Congresswoman Martha Griffiths, &quot;Martha, I’ll tell you the truth. I offered it as a joke.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topstoriespittsburgh.com/news/william-petrocelli-the-most-important-womens-rights-legislation-in-history-to-some-it-was-just-a-joke/]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], in charge of the enforcement of Title VII, ignored sex discrimination complaints, and the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment went unenforced for the next few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DUqK99RZzdEC&amp;pg=PA290 |title=The will of the people: how public&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One EEOC director called the prohibition &quot;a fluke...conceived out of wedlock,&quot; and even the liberal magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot; asked, &quot;Why should a mischievous joke perpetrated on the floor of the House of Representatives be treated by a responsible administration body with this kind of seriousness?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt;

In 1966, at the third National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women, the conference organizers did not allow resolutions or actions of any kind meant to abolish discrimination against women, so some women who were attending decided to form an advocacy organization of their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;google6&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yv_89YqMxZ4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA204 |title=The Columbia documentary history of&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornering a large table at the conference luncheon, so that they could start organizing before they had to rush for planes, each of those women chipped in five dollars, Betty Friedan wrote the acronym NOW on a napkin, and the National Organization for Women was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;google6&quot;/&gt; Its first meeting was held on June 28, 1966 in Betty Friedan's hotel room, with 28 women attending.&lt;ref name=&quot;now.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=National Organization for Women |url=http://www.now.org/history/founders.html |title=Honoring Our Founders |publisher=Now.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its first conference in October 1966, Friedan was elected NOW's first president, and her fame as the author of the bestselling book ''The Feminine Mystique'' helped attract thousands of women to the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;now.org&quot;/&gt; Friedan drafted NOW's original Statement of Purpose, which began, &quot;The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;now.org&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, in 1966, Congresswoman [[Martha Griffiths]] admonished the EEOC on the floor of Congress for their failure to enforce the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C4IYnNCmmRUC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253 |title=The hollow hope: can courts bring&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment discrimination against women began to be taken more seriously in the late 1960s. In 1967, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] issued Executive Order 11375, which declared that federal employers must take affirmative action to ensure that employees receive equal treatment and opportunities regardless of gender, race, color, or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA190 |title=Women's rights: a global view - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 the EEOC, following two years of protests by NOW, banned all help wanted ads which specified which sex a job applicant should be, except those jobs for which being a certain sex was a bona fide occupational requirement (such as actress), opening many hitherto unattainable jobs to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5kjkZjvnI-sC&amp;pg=PA130 |title=Timelines of American women's history - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled the ban legal in Pittsburgh Press Co. v Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376 (1973).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justicelearning.org/justice_timeline/Issues.aspx?IssueID=13&amp;TimelineID=54&amp;TimelineEventID=1268] [http://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;pg=PA235]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several other feminist advances in the late 1960s, in both conservative and liberal circles. In 1968 conservative women separated from NOW and organized [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL) to campaign for equal opportunities for women in education, economics, and employment, while avoiding issues such as abortion, sexuality, and the Equal Rights Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R6UEj0ov2bQC&amp;pg=PA111 |title=Encyclopedia of Title nine and sports - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1968, liberal activist [[Robin Morgan]] led a protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City;&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vRY27FkGJAUC&amp;pg=PA368 |title=Culture wars: an encyclopedia of&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the protest a group of about one hundred women tossed items that they considered symbolic of women’s oppression into a Freedom Trash Can, including copies of Playboy, high-heeled shoes, corsets, and girdles.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy |first=Ariel |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/11/16/091116crbo_books_levy |title=Feminism and Gail Collins’s &quot;When Everything Changed&quot; |publisher=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also crowned a sheep as Miss America.&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot;/&gt; [[Lindsy Van Gelder]], a reporter for the Post, wrote a piece about the protest in which she compared the trash-can procession to the burning of draft cards at antiwar marches.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com&quot;/&gt; However, the rumor that women burned their bras at the protest is not true.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com&quot;/&gt;

Litigation for women's rights now began to have a serious impact on American life. In 1969 California adopted the nation’s first [[no-fault divorce]] law, which was intended to promote equality between men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;justicelearning.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.justicelearning.org/justice_timeline/Issues.aspx?IssueID=13&amp;TimelineID=54&amp;TimelineEventID=1268]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nnXY4iV1lRcC&amp;pg=PA153 |title=The Consequences of divorce&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, all 50 states had legalized no-fault divorce, with New York being the last state to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beverly Willett |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-28/no-fault-divorce-my-fight-to-save-my-marriage/ |title=No-Fault Divorce: My Fight to Save My Marriage |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 the case Weeks v Southern Bell was decided in favor of [[Lorena Weeks]], who had applied for a better job as a switchperson, but had her application rejected because, her union boss said, &quot;the man is the breadwinner in the family, and women just do not need this type of job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allbusiness.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/labor-employment-law-discrimination-gender-sex/14174508-1.html |title=Business solutions from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks filed a complaint with the EEOC, but the phone company cited a Georgia law that prohibited women from lifting anything heavier than 30&amp;nbsp;pounds, although the 34-pound manual typewriter Weeks used as a clerk had to be lifted by hand onto her desk every morning and stored away every night.&lt;ref name=&quot;allbusiness.com&quot;/&gt; After the case was decided, she received $31,000 in back pay and got the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;allbusiness.com&quot;/&gt; In the 1971 Supreme Court case [[Reed v Reed]], the Supreme Court ruled that it is illegal for any state to prefer all men over all women as administrators of assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;supremecourthistory.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/learning/supremecourthistory_learning_womens2.htm]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time ever that the Court had struck down a state law on the ground that it discriminated against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;supremecourthistory.org&quot;/&gt;

In addition to litigation, feminist activists also began to form their own institutions to propagate their ideals. In 1971 Rep. [[Bella Abzug]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]] founded the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] to advocate for more women and feminists in elective office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bzLCEhRx39wC&amp;pg=PA67 |title=Women and political participation: a&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1971, [[Gloria Steinem]] and others began publishing [[Ms. Magazine]], the first national feminist magazine&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=%22&amp;nbsp;ms+magazine+%22+%22first+national+feminist+magazine%22&lt;/ref&gt; The first three hundred thousand copies of Ms. sold out in eight days; the magazine name comes from the fact that the title Ms. was originally popularized by feminists in the 1970s to replace Miss and Mrs. and provide a parallel term to Mr., in that both Ms. and Mr. designate gender without indicating marital status.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EZ-yXBMtFysC&amp;pg=PA167 |title=The feminist critique of language: a&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=March 25, 1998 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1972, former NOW members [[Pat Goltz]] and [[Cathy Callaghan]] founded [[Feminists for Life]], with the goal of eliminating the root causes that they felt drove women to abortion, contending that abortion violated core feminist principles of justice, non-discrimination and [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/joinus.htm|title=Feminists for Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/human-life-review.htm|title=''Human Life Review''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important feminist successes of the early 1970s was when Nixon signed into law the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act|Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972]] and [[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;definitions.uslegal.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/e/equal-employment-opportunity-act/ |title=Equal Employment Opportunity Act Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act|Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972]] gives the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) authority to sue in federal courts when it finds reasonable cause to believe that there has been employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;definitions.uslegal.com&quot;/&gt; In the case of public employment, the EEOC refers the matter to the United States Attorney General to bring the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;definitions.uslegal.com&quot;/&gt; [[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 requires gender equity in every educational program that receives federal funding including but not limited to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titleix.info/History/History-Overview.aspx |title=History Overview |publisher=TitleIX.info |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the feminist movement did have some notable setbacks around this time. In 1972 President Nixon vetoed the [[Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1972]], which many feminists advocated and which would have established both early-education programs and after-school care across the country, with tuition on a sliding scale based on a family’s income bracket, and the program available to everyone but participation required of no one.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com&quot;/&gt; The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] passed the Senate and then the House of Representatives in 1972, and on March 22, 1972, it was sent to the states for ratification.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/era.htm |title=History |publisher=Equalrightsamendment.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not ratified before the deadline for ratification passed, and therefore never became law.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;/&gt; The most influential ERA opponent was Phyllis Schlafly, right-wing leader of the Eagle Forum/STOP ERA, who claimed that the ERA would deny a woman’s right to be supported by her husband, privacy rights would be overturned, women would be sent into combat, and abortion rights and same-sex marriages would be upheld.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, some states'-rights advocates thought the ERA was a federal power grab, and business interests such as the insurance industry opposed a measure they believed would cost them money.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;/&gt; Opposition to the ERA was also organized by fundamentalist religious groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;/&gt; Pro-ERA advocacy was led by the National Organization for Women (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of nearly 80 other organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment.org&quot;/&gt;

One of the most controversial developments in American women's lives has been the legalization of abortion. In 1973 in the Supreme Court case [[Roe v Wade]], the Supreme Court ruled that it is an illegal violation of privacy to outlaw or regulate any aspect of abortion performed during the first trimester of pregnancy, and that government can only enact abortion regulations reasonably related to maternal health in the second and third trimesters, and can enact abortion laws protecting the life of the fetus only in the third trimester.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_roe.html |title=The Supreme Court . Expanding Civil Rights . Landmark Cases . Roe v. Wade (1973) |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even in the third trimester, an exception has to be made to protect the life of the mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;/&gt; This ruling has been extremely controversial from the moment it was made.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;/&gt; [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]] had brought the lawsuit that led to Roe v Wade on behalf of a pregnant woman, Dallas area resident [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] (&quot;Jane Roe&quot;), claiming a Texas law criminalizing most abortions violated Roe's constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;/&gt; The Texas law banned all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother, and Roe claimed that while her life was not endangered, she could not afford to travel out of state and had a right to terminate her pregnancy in a safe medical environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;/&gt;

One of the most famous feminist media events, aside from the 1968 Miss America protest, was the tennis match known as the &quot;Battle of the Sexes.&quot; In this match, on September 20, 1973, in Houston, Texas, women's tennis champion [[Billie Jean King]] defeated Bobby Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3,  before a worldwide television audience estimated at almost 50 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016060.html |title=ESPN.com: Billie Jean won for all women |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 55-year-old former tennis champion [[Bobby Riggs]] had defeated Australian tennis player [[Margaret Court]] earlier that year, and he was an outspoken opponent of feminism, saying for example, &quot;If a woman wants to get in the headlines, she should have quintuplets,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007362/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=November 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot; and calling himself a &quot;male chauvinist pig&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn.go.com&quot;/&gt;

There were a few important legal gains for women in the mid-1970s. The [[Women's Educational Equity Act]], enacted in 1974, provides federal funds for projects designed to promote gender equity in the curriculum, in counseling and guidance, in physical education, and in the development of classroom materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;college.cengage.com&quot;&gt;http://www.college.cengage.com/history/readerscomp/women/html/wh_040100_womenseducat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also supports activities for reentering women students, expanding vocational and career education for women, and funding women's resource center initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;college.cengage.com&quot;/&gt; The [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]], enacted in 1974, illegalizes credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because someone receives public assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre15.shtm |title=Equal Credit Opportunity: Understanding Your Rights Under the Law |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this Act, creditors may ask you for most of this information in certain situations, but they may not use it when deciding whether to give you credit or when setting the terms of your credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc.gov&quot;/&gt; In the 1975 Supreme Court case [[Taylor v Louisiana]], the Supreme Court ruled that excluding women from the jury pool is illegal because it violates a person's right to a fair trial by a representative segment of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/jury-system-e.html |title=The Jury System - Inclusion of Minorities and Women |publisher=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] was passed, making employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-preg.html |title=Facts About Pregnancy Discrimination |publisher=Eeoc.gov |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important event around this time was the Vietnam War. Approximately 7,000 American military women served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War (1965–1975), the majority of them as nurses.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PD8WAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Women veterans' benefits and&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=August 21, 1991 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Army nurse, Sharon Ann Lane, was the only U.S. military woman to die from enemy fire in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usar.army.mil/arweb/newsandmedia/storiesfromthefront/Pages/womens_history_lane.aspx |title=1st Lt.

During the 1970s, feminists also worked to bring greater attention and help to women suffering from domestic violence and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z8tSQRg7FgIC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Feminists negotiate the state: the&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not true that the expression &quot;rule of thumb&quot; comes from men beating women with sticks as big as their thumbs, as has been rumored,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html |title=The &quot;Rule of Thumb for Wife-Beating&quot; Hoax |publisher=Debunker.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is true that little help was available to battered women before the 1970s, when some of the first battered women's shelters were created and states began adopting domestic violence laws providing for civil orders of protection and better police protection (the first &quot;modern&quot; women's shelter in the world was Haven House, which opened in 1964 in [[California]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfsla.org/havenhouse/domestic_violence/shelter/prevention_education/C61#contentPrimary |title=jfsla.org |publisher=Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LJX3Ql7bu2YC&amp;pg=PA1023 |title=Encyclopedia of crime and punishment - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=March 18, 2002 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not true that either Catherine MacKinnon or Andrea Dworkin (both feminist activists) said &quot;all sex is rape&quot;, or &quot;all men are rapists,&quot; or &quot;all sex is sexual harassment&quot;, as has been rumored;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/quotes/mackinnon.asp |title=Catherine MacKinnon 'All Sex is Rape' Quote |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, during the 1970s feminist activists worked to change laws stating that there had to be a witness other than the woman herself to charge a man with rape, and that a woman's sexual history could be brought up at trial, while the alleged rapist's could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDd2aNCoGlYC&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Public Women, Public Words: A&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=March 28, 2005 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, due to feminist activism the first law against marital rape (raping one's spouse) was enacted by South Dakota in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZobatN9UcpEC&amp;pg=PA326 |title=Sex for Dummies - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, marital rape had become a crime in all 50 states in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHAfpoCO5yMC&amp;pg=PA83 |title=Fundamentals of Criminal Justice: A&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s brought more firsts for American women. 1980 was the first year that a higher percentage of women than men voted in a Presidential election, and a higher percentage of women than men have voted in every Presidential election since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/content_5270.cfm |title=Women Voters and the Gender Gap &amp;#124; APSA |publisher=Apsanet.org |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and became the first female Supreme Court Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/justices/sandra_day_oconnor |title=Sandra Day O'Connor &amp;#124; The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law |publisher=Oyez.org |date=March 26, 1930 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983 [[Sally Ride]] became the first female American astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Sally K.

Younger women now began to be more involved in feminism. In the early 1990s, [[third wave feminism]] began as a response to the second wave's perceived inadequacies and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CdNCI-m8Lc0C&amp;pg=PA278 |title=Approaches to Political Thought - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third wave feminism, which continues today, is most often associated with a younger generation of feminist activism, an interest in popular culture and sexual agency, and an acceptance of pluralism and contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gqCoOSsnOeEC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Nightwood Theatre: a woman's work is&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=January 30, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 in Olympia, Washington, [[Riot grrrl]] began in reaction to the domination of the punk rock scene of America's Pacific Northwest by all-male bands, and as an attempt to establish a female-friendly presence within this scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uX2DajVRUOIC&amp;pg=PA238 |title=Women in German Yearbook, Volume 21&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl consisted of feminist punk bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, and their zines, meetings and songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1aIej6WjeqEC&amp;pg=PA19 |title=Everything you need to know about&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerns of military women again came to the fore as the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991) utilized an unprecedented proportion of women from the active forces (7%) as well as the Reserve and National Guard (17%).&lt;ref name=&quot;userpages.aug.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html |title=American Women in Uniform, Desert Storm |publisher=Userpages.aug.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40,000 US military women served in combat support positions throughout the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;userpages.aug.com&quot;/&gt; Sixteen women died during the war and two were held prisoner.&lt;ref name=&quot;userpages.aug.com&quot;/&gt; In 1991 the [[Tailhook]] Scandal occurred at the annual Tailhook Association convention held in Las Vegas, with more than 26 women (14 of them officers) being assaulted by scores of drunken naval and marine officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8kETsH4flCMC&amp;pg=PA220 |title=Encyclopedia of women in American&amp;nbsp;... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations that the Navy mishandled the subsequent investigation were deeply damaging to the Navy's reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1991&quot;/&gt;

Another famous sexual harassment case occurred when in 1991 [[Anita Hill]], a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, came forward with accusations that [[Clarence Thomas]] (who had just been nominated for the Supreme Court) had sexually harassed her.&lt;ref name=&quot;chnm.gmu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hill/hilloutline2.htm |title=An Outline of the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas Controversy |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill had worked for Thomas years earlier when he was head of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], and she charged that Thomas harassed her with inappropriate discussion of sexual acts and pornographic films after she rebuffed his invitations to date him.&lt;ref name=&quot;chnm.gmu.edu&quot;/&gt; When Thomas testified against Hill's claims before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he called the hearings, &quot;a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,&quot; although Hill herself was black.&lt;ref name=&quot;chnm.gmu.edu&quot;/&gt; In the end, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm Clarence Thomas as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;chnm.gmu.edu&quot;/&gt;

The 1990s brought more firsts for women in politics and the military. 1992 was known as the &quot;[[Year of the Woman]]&quot; because more women than ever before were elected to political office that year (women gained 19 House and 3 Senate seats for a total of 47 seats in the House and seven seats in the Senate) including [[Carol Moseley Braun]], the first black female senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art &amp; History Home &gt; Photo Exhibit |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] was confirmed by Congress as a Supreme Court Justice, becoming the second woman on the court.

Two important cases concerning women's rights were litigated in the late 1990s. The [[Matter of Kasinga]] was a legal case decided in June 1996 involving Fauziya Kassindja (surname also spelled as Kasinga), a [[Togo]]lese teenager seeking [[asylum in the United States]] in order to escape a tribal practice of [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugger, Celia W. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E1DB1439F935A25755C0A960958260 Asylum from Mutilation]&quot;. ''[[New York Times]]''. 16 June 2006. Retrieved 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] granted her asylum in June 1996 after an earlier judge denied her claims. The case set a precedent in United States [[immigration law]] as applicants could now seek asylum in the United States from gender-based persecution, whereas previously religious or political grounds were often used to grant asylum. In 1999 [[Lilly Ledbetter]], a supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, sued Goodyear because she was being paid at least 15% less than the men who held the same job.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/30/nation/na-scotus30 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Only fresh bias counts, court rules | first=David G. | last=Savage | date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury sided with her and awarded her back pay of $224,000 and nearly $3.3 million in punitive damages, but the company appealed, arguing she filed her claim too late, and it won a reversal from a U.S. appeals court in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt; In 2007 the Supreme Court agreed with the company and ruled that her suit should have been thrown out at the start because it relied on evidence of discrimination in the 1980s, not on unfair pay decisions in 1998 or 1999; the Supreme Court declared that employees wishing to file discrimination charges must do so no more than 180 days after they have received their first discriminatory paycheck, although Lilly Ledbetter did not know she had been discriminated against in pay until much more than 180 days had passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt; However, in 2009 President Barack Obama signed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] into law (the first bill signed into law during his presidency), which changed the law so that now workers can sue up to 180 days after receiving any discriminatory paycheck, not just the first discriminatory paycheck.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, [[Ann Dunwoody]] became the first female four-star general in the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asfar |first=Roy |url=https://www.veteransadvantage.com/cms/content/ann-dunwoody |title=Ann Dunwoody:First Female 4-Star General&amp;#124;Top Vets |publisher=Veterans Advantage |date=November 24, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/14/national/main4602923.shtml | work=CBS News | title=U.S. Names First Female 4-Star General | date=November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Sandra Stosz]] assumed command of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, becoming the first woman superintendent of that institution, and the first woman to command any U.S. service academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;uscg.mil&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacewicz |first=Tony |url=http://newlondon.patch.com/articles/video-coast-guard-academy-welcomes-first-woman-superintendent#video-6396214 |title=newlondon.patch.com |publisher=newlondon.patch.com |date=3 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, [[Patricia Horoho]] became the first female U.S. Army surgeon general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/12/army-first-female-surgeon-general-sworn-in-121711w/ |title=Army’s first female surgeon general sworn in – Army News &amp;#124; News from Afghanistan &amp; Iraq |publisher=Army Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] became the first same-sex couple to be legally married in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/12/GAYMARRIAGE.TMP | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; since San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom allowed city hall to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by Jonathan DarmanJanuary 17, 2009 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/01/16/hoping-that-left-is-right.html |title=SF Mayor Gavin Newsom Risks Career on Gay Marriage |publisher=Newsweek |date=January 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all same-sex marriages done in 2004 in California were annulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/19/california.proposition/index.html | work=CNN | title=Prop 8 proponents seek to nullify same-sex marriages | date=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the California Supreme Court decision in 2008 that granted same-sex couples in California the right to marry, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon remarried, and were again the first same-sex couple in the state to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories08/june/0613082.htm |title=First couple in California's 2004 marriages will say vows again on Monday |publisher=Gaypeopleschronicle.com |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/us/16cnd-weddings.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=Gay Marriages Begin in California | first=Jesse | last=McKinley | date=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2008 Prop 8 illegalized same-sex marriage in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/editorial-maine-was-asking-the-wrong-people-1.2058087#3 |title=Editorial &amp;#124; Maine was asking the wrong people - Tufts Daily - Tufts University |publisher=Tufts Daily |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the marriages that occurred between the California Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage and the approval of Prop 8 illegalizing it are still considered valid, including the marriage of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2009/0527/p02s01-usju.html |title=California's top court upholds Prop. 8 ban on same-sex marriage |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=May 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American women achieved many political firsts in the 2000s. In 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]] became the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Nancy_Pelosi |title=Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi California, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi - WhoRunsGov.com/The Washington Post |publisher=Whorunsgov.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; she held the position for just under four years. In 2008 Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first woman to win a presidential primary, winning the New Hampshire Democratic primary although polls had predicted she would lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22551718/ |title=N.H. stunner: Clinton defeats Obama - politics - Decision '08 - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressive.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/article.php?article_id=205 |title=The Stanford Progressive |publisher=Progressive.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually lost the Democratic nomination for President to Barack Obama, who went on to become President;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/04/barackobama.hillaryclinton | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US elections: Barack Obama wins Democratic nomination for president | first1=Ewen | last1=MacAskill | first2=Suzanne | last2=Goldenberg | date=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27531033/ |title=Obama elected 44th president - politics - Decision '08 - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Hillary Clinton did receive 18 million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/hillary-clint-4.html | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Top of the Ticket | date=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Alaska governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first woman nominated for Vice President by the Republican Party, although she was not elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082901112.html | work=The Washington Post | title=McCain Picks Alaska Governor; Palin First Woman on GOP Ticket | first1=Robert | last1=Barnes | first2=Michael D. | last2=Shear | date=August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 and 2010, respectively, [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as Supreme Court Associate Justices, making them the third and fourth female justices, but because Justice O'Connor had previously retired, this made the first time three women have served together on the Supreme Court. Sen. [[Barbara Mikulski]] of Maryland was re-elected to a fifth term in 2010; when the 112th Congress was sworn in, she became the longest serving female senator ever, passing Sen. [[Margaret Chase Smith]]. During this term, she surpassed [[Edith Nourse Rogers]] as the woman to serve the longest in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/barbara-mikulski-honored-as-longest-serving-woman-in-congress/2012/03/21/gIQA6d5JSS_blog.html |title=Barbara Mikulski honored as longest-serving woman in Congress - 2chambers |publisher=The Washington Post |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, due to the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] being signed into law, the definition of federal hate crime was expanded to include those violent crimes in which the victim is selected due to their actual or perceived gender and/or gender identity; previously federal hate crimes were defined as only those violent crimes where the victim is selected due to their race, color, religion, or national origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/us/politics/09hate.html | work=The New York Times | title=House Votes to Expand Hate Crimes Definition | first=Carl | last=Hulse | date=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track statistics on hate crimes based on gender and gender identity (statistics for the other groups were already tracked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/laws_and_elections/5660.htm |title=Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
