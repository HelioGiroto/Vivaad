The '''Eighth Crusade''' was a [[crusade]] launched by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], [[King of France]], in 1270. The Eighth Crusade is sometimes counted as the Seventh, if the [[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Crusade]]s of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] are counted as a single crusade. The [[Ninth Crusade]] is sometimes also counted as part of the Eighth.

Louis was disturbed by events in [[Syria]], where the [[Mamluk]] [[sultan]] [[Baibars]] had been attacking the remnant of the [[Crusader states]]. Baibars had seized the opportunity after a war pitting the cities of [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]] against each other (1256–1260) had exhausted the Syrian ports that the two cities controlled. By 1265 Baibars had captured [[Nazareth]], [[Haifa]], [[Toron]], and [[Arsuf]]. [[Hugh III of Cyprus]], nominal [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]], landed in [[Akko|Acre]] to defend that city, while Baibars marched as far north as [[Armenia]], which was at that time under [[Mongol]] control.

These events led to Louis' call for a new crusade in 1267, although there was little support this time; [[Jean de Joinville]], the chronicler who accompanied Louis on the [[Seventh Crusade]], refused to go. Louis was soon convinced by his brother [[Charles of Anjou]] to attack [[Tunis]] first, which would give them a strong base for attacking [[Egypt]], the focus of Louis' [[Sixth crusade|previous crusade]] as well as the [[Fifth Crusade]] before him, both of which had been defeated there. Charles, as [[Kingdom of Sicily|King of Sicily]], also had his own interests in this area of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Khalif]] of Tunis, [[Muhammad I al-Mustansir]], also had connections with Christian Spain and was considered a good candidate for conversion. In 1270 Louis landed on the African coast in July, a very unfavourable season for landing. Much of the army became sick because of poor drinking water, his [[Damietta]] born son John Sorrow died on August 3 and on August 25&lt;ref&gt;John Sorrow (in French Jean Tristan) was born in Damietta, Egypt on April 8, 1250 during the Seventh Crusade.&lt;/ref&gt;  Louis himself died from a &quot;flux in the stomach&quot;, one day after the arrival of Charles. His dying word was &quot;Jerusalem.&quot; Charles proclaimed Louis' son [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] the new king, but because of his youth Charles became the actual leader of the crusade.

Because of further diseases the siege of Tunis was abandoned on October 30 by an agreement with the sultan. In this agreement the Christians gained free trade with Tunis, and residence for monks and priests in the city was guaranteed, so the crusade could be regarded as a partial success. After hearing of the death of Louis and the evacuation of the crusaders from Tunis, Sultan [[Baibars]] of Egypt cancelled his plan to send Egyptian troops to fight Louis in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p. 69/vol.2&lt;/ref&gt; Charles now allied himself with [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward of England]], who had arrived in the meantime. When Charles called off the attack on Tunis, Edward continued on to [[Akko|Acre]], the last crusader outpost in Syria. His time spent there is often called the [[Ninth Crusade]].

==Attendant literature==
[[Bertran d'Alamanon]], a diplomat in the service of Charles of Anjou, and [[Ricaut Bonomel]], a Templar in the Holy Land, both composed songs around 1265. Bertran criticised the decline of Christianity in Outremer, while Bonomel criticised the Papal policy of pursuing wars in Italy with money that should have gone overseas.

The failure of the Eighth Crusade, like those of its predecessors, caused a response to be crafted in [[Occitan literature|Occitan poetry]] by the [[troubadours]]. The death of Louis of France especially sparked their creative output, notable considering the hostility which the troubadours had had towards the French monarchy during the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Three ''[[planh]]s'', songs of lament, were composed for the death of Louis IX.

[[Guilhem d'Autpol]] composed ''Fortz tristors es e salvaj'a retraire'' for Louis. [[Raimon Gaucelm de Bezers]] composed ''Qui vol aver complida amistansa'' to celebrate the preparations of the Crusade in 1268, but in 1270 he had to compose ''Ab grans trebalhs et ab grans marrimens'' in commemoration of the French king. [[Austorc de Segret]] composed ''No sai quim so, tan sui desconoissens'', a more general [[Crusading song]], that laments Louis but also that either God or Satan is misleading Christians. He also attacks Louis' brother Charles, whom he calls the ''caps e guitz'' (head and guide) of the infidels, because he convinced Louis to attack Tunis and not the [[Holy Land]], and he immediately negotiated a peace with the Muslims after Louis' death.

After the Crusade, the aged troubadour [[Peire Cardenal]] wrote a song, ''Totz lo mons es vestitiz et abrazatz'', encouraging Louis' heir, Philip III, to go to the Holy Land to aid Edward Longshanks.

Satiric verses were composed in Tunis about Louis' new plan to invade Tunis: &quot;O Louis, Tunis is the sister of Egypt! thus expect your ordeal! you will find your tomb here instead of the house of Ibn Lokman; and the eunuch Sobih will be here replaced by Munkir and Nakir.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Verses by a contemporary Tunesian named Ahmad Ismail Alzayat (Al-Maqrizi, p.462/vol.1) – House of Ibn Lokman was the house in Al Mansurah where Louis was imprisoned in chains after he was captured in Fariskur during the 7th crusade he was under the guard of a eunuch named Sobih. According to Muslim creed Munkir and Nakir are two angels who interrogate the dead.&lt;/ref&gt;
