The '''Age of Sail''' refers to the era when [[sailing ships]] were an important means of transport. The term is normally used to refer to this era in Western countries, lasting from the 16th to the 19th centuries, with the 19th century peak called the '''Golden Age of Sail'''. However, in the Middle East and Far East the dominance of sailing ships began far earlier, in the 3rd or 2nd millennium BC.

==Middle East and Far East==
Seafaring exploration began during the rise of ancient civilizations including [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Far East]] and the [[Cradle of Civilization]]. The [[Arabian Sea]] has been an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] since the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the [[3rd millennium BCE]], certainly the late [[2nd millennium BCE]] up to and including the later days of the Age of Sail. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north. These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravans, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates. Southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. The red sea canal was redug and existed in Egypt until the Islamic era.

==Western countries==
In western countries, the Age of Sail is the period in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sail]]ing [[ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid 19th century. This is a significant period during which [[square-rig]]ged sailing ships carried [[History of colonialism|European settlers]] to many parts of the world in one of the most expansive [[imperialism|imperialistic movements]], one of the most significant eras in recorded history as the onset of the [[modern world]], defined largely by foreign invasions, [[colonialism]] and [[human migration]]s.

Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], culminating with the advance of [[steam power]], rendering sail power in warfare obsolete.

Sailing ships continued to be an economical way to transport cargo on long voyages into the 1920s.  Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland.  Crucially though, steam powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. It is this factor that drove sailing ships aside. Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches (see [[disruptive technology]]) and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

===Golden Age of Sail===
In [[Europe]], the Golden Age of Sail is generally agreed to be the period in the 19th century when the efficiency and usage of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak ([[clipper]]s, [[tall ship]]s, etc.) and immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Some{{who|date=December 2010}} would say that the Golden Age of Sail relates specifically to the clipper ship era.{{Specify|date=August 2007}} while others put the Golden Age of Sail between 1850 and the early 1900s when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html ''Maritime Museum of the Atlantic'', &quot;Sailing Ship Rigs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Golden Age&quot; is also a term used to describe the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], the time period from 1690 to 1725 when well-known pirates such as Edward Teach ([[Blackbeard]]) and [[Bartholomew Roberts]] were preying on mercantile ships, and sometimes even blockading ports, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;David Cordingly, ''Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates'', (Harvest Books, 1995), pp.xvi-xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Golden Age of Sail has been said to be between the [[War of 1812]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth318/Class%2024%20-%20American%20enterprise%20in%20the%2019th%20century.htm nautarch.tamu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 1830 and 1880,&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/research/faq.html museum.gov.ns.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; a time during which sailing vessels increasingly adopted steam engines, making overseas shipping more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdcr.gov/news/2006/NCMM02-08-2006.asp ncdcr.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;
