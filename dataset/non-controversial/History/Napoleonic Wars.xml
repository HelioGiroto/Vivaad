&lt;li&gt;{{note|aaa}} The term &quot;Austrian Empire&quot; came into use after Napoleon crowned himself [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804, whereby [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]] took the title [[Emperor of Austria]] (''Kaiser von Österreich'') in response. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved in 1806, and consequently &quot;Emperor of Austria&quot; became Francis' primary title. For this reason, &quot;Austrian Empire&quot; is often used instead of &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; for brevity's sake when speaking of the Napoleonic Wars, even though the two entities are not synonymous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|bbb}}Both Austria and Prussia briefly became allies of France and contributed forces to the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|ccc}}Russia became an ally of France following the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807. The alliance broke down in 1810, which led to the French invasion in 1812. During that time Russia waged war against [[Finnish War|Sweden]] (1808–1809) and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Ottoman Empire]] (1806–1812), and nominally against [[Anglo-Russian War (1807-1812)|Britain]] (1807–1812).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|ddd}}Spain was an ally of France until a stealthy French invasion in 1808, then fought France in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|eee}}Sicily remained in personal union with Naples until Naples became a French client-republic following the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]] in 1806.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|fff}}Nominally, Sweden declared [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810-1812)|war against the United Kingdom]] after its defeat by Russia in the Finnish War (1808–1809).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|ggg}}Napoleon established the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], ruled by the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in 1807. [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]] had already been serving in the French armies beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|hhh}}The French Empire annexed the [[Kingdom of Holland]] in 1810. Dutch troops fought against Napoleon during the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|iii}}The French Empire annexed the [[Kingdom of Etruria]] in 1807.
&lt;li&gt;{{note|jjj}}The [[Kingdom of Naples]], briefly allied with Austria in 1814, allied with France again and fought against Austria during the [[Neapolitan War]] in 1815.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|kkk}}Sixteen of France's allies among the German states (including Bavaria and Württemberg) established the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] in July 1806 following the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (December 1805). Following the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] (October 1806), various other German states that had previously fought alongside the anti-French allies, including Saxony and Westphalia, also allied with France and joined the Confederation. Saxony changed sides again in 1813 during the [[Battle of Leipzig]], causing most other member-states to quickly follow suit and declare war on France.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|lll}}Denmark-Norway remained neutral until the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)]]. Denmark was compelled to cede Norway to Sweden by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814. Following a brief [[Swedish-Norwegian War (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]], Norway entered a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|mmm}}The Ottoman Empire fought against Napoleon in the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria]] as part of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. During the Napoleonic era of 1803 to 1815, the Empire participated in two wars against the Allies: against Britain in the [[Anglo-Turkish War (1807–1809)]] and against Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)]]. However, Russia was allied with Napoleon 1807–1812.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|nnn}}These four states were the leading nations of the Confederation,but the Confederation was made up of a total of 43 principalities, kingdoms, and duchies.
&lt;li&gt;{{note|ooo}}Was a commander for the French Empire, as Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, 1804–1810.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|ppp}}Joseph Bonaparte ruled as Joseph I of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] from 30 March 1806 to 6 June 1808, and of [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]] from 8 June 1808 to 11 December 1813. He also served as a French commander before and after these two reigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|qqq}}Persia fought against Russia from 1804–1813; the Russians were allied with Napoleon 1807–1812.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note|rrr}}[[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] participated in the war with separate Hungarian regiments in the Imperial and Royal Army (the &quot;royal&quot; part has referred to the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary since 1745) and also by a traditional army (&quot;insurrectio&quot;). The Hungarian Diet voted to join in war and agreed to pay one third of the war expenses. It also authorized the crown to recruit soldiers in Hungary. [[Francis I of Austria|Francis I]] ruled the country as King of Hungary because Hungary was only formally part of the Empire of Austria. The kingdom was ''regnum independens'', a separate Land as Article X of 1790 stipulated. His new title (Emperor of Austria) did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution of Hungary according to the Hungarian Diet and the proclamation of Francis I in a rescript, thus the country was part of the other Lands of the empire largely through the monarch.&lt;/li&gt;

{{Campaignbox Napoleonic Wars}}
The '''Napoleonic Wars''' (1803–1815) were a series of wars declared against [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] [[First French Empire|French Empire]] by opposing coalitions. As a continuation of [[French Revolutionary Wars|the wars]] sparked by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, they revolutionised European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale, mainly owing to the application of modern [[Levée en masse|mass conscription]]. French power rose quickly as Napoleon's armies conquered much of Europe but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia in 1812]]. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat resulting in the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France]].

Despite a final victory against Napoleon, five of seven coalitions saw defeat at the hands of France. France beat the first and second coalition during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and defeated the third (Victory of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]), the fourth (Victory de [[Battle of Jena|Jena]], [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]) and fifth coalition (Victory of [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]]) under the leadership of Napoleon. These great victories gave the French Army a sense of invulnerability, especially when they approached Moscow. But after the retreat from Russia, in spite of incomplete victories, France was beaten by the sixth coalition at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and the seventh coalition at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

The wars resulted in the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and sowed the seeds of nascent nationalism in [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Italy]] that would lead to the two nations' respective consolidations later in the century. Meanwhile, the global [[Spanish Empire]] began to unravel as French [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|occupation of Spain]] weakened Spain's hold over its colonies, providing an opening for [[Spanish American wars of independence|nationalist revolutions in Spanish America]]. As a direct result of the Napoleonic wars, the [[British Empire]] became the foremost [[world power]] for the next century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Niall|year=2004|title=Empire, The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus beginning ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.

No consensus exists as to when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. An early candidate is 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte seized power in France with the coup of ''[[18 Brumaire]]''. 18 May 1803 is the most commonly used date, as this was when a renewed declaration of war between Britain and France (resulting from the collapse of the [[Treaty of Amiens]]), ended the only period of general peace in Europe between 1792 and 1814. The Napoleonic Wars ended following Napoleon's final [[Battle of Waterloo|defeat at Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]].

==Background 1789–1802==
{{Main|French Revolution|French Revolutionary Wars|War of the First Coalition|War of the Second Coalition}}
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 had a significant impact throughout Europe, which only increased with the arrest of King [[Louis XVI of France]] in 1792 and his execution in January 1793 for &quot;crimes of tyranny&quot; against the French people. The first attempt to crush the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] came in 1793 when [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Prussia]], Spain and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] formed the [[First Coalition]]. French measures, including general conscription (''[[levée en masse]]''), military reform, and [[total war]], contributed to the defeat of the First Coalition, despite the [[French Counter-Revolution|civil war occurring in France]]. The war ended when [[Napoleon I|General Napoleon Bonaparte]] forced the Austrians to accept his terms in the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]. Only Great Britain remained diplomatically opposed to the French Republic.

The [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798 by Austria, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Naples, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Papal States]], Portugal, [[Russia]], Sweden and other states. During the War of the Second Coalition, the French Republic suffered from corruption and [[Chouannerie|internal division]] under the [[French Directory|Directory]]. France also lacked funds, and no longer had the services of [[Lazare Carnot]], the war minister who had guided it to successive victories following extensive reforms during the early 1790s. Bonaparte, the main architect of victory in the last years of the First Coalition, had gone to campaign in [[Egypt]]. Missing two of its most important military figures from the previous conflict, the Republic suffered successive defeats against revitalized enemies whom British financial support brought back into the war.

Bonaparte returned from Egypt to France on 23 August 1799, and seized control of the French government on 9 November 1799 in the [[18 Brumaire|coup of 18 Brumaire]], replacing the [[French Directory|Directory]] with the [[French consulate|Consulate]]. He reorganized the French military and created a reserve army positioned to support campaigns either on the [[Rhine]] or in Italy. On all fronts, French advances caught the Austrians off guard and knocked Russia out of the war. In Italy, Bonaparte won a notable victory against the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] in 1800, but the decisive win came at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] later that year. The defeated Austrians left the conflict after the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (9 February 1801), forcing Britain to sign the &quot;[[Treaty of Amiens|peace of Amiens&quot;]] with France. Thus the Second Coalition ended in another French triumph. However, the United Kingdom remained an important influence on the continental powers in encouraging their hostility towards France. London had brought the Second Coalition together through subsidies, and Bonaparte realized that without either defeating the British or signing a treaty with them he could not achieve complete peace.

Sources in the UK occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French [[Second Hundred Years' War]], spanning the period 1689 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Buffinton, Arthur H.

==War between Britain and France, 1803–1814==
[[File:Gillray - The First Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|British caricature of the Peace of Amiens ([[James Gillray]]).]]
Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] to the House of Lords &quot;I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea&quot;), the United Kingdom maintained low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could remain at war with France. These payments are colloquially known as the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]]. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808–1814, assisted by Spanish [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and invading southern France. By 1815, the British Army would play the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.

In 1802, Napoleon victoriously brought to an end the [[War of the Second Coalition]], with only Great Britain remaining formally at war. Isolated, Britain reluctantly agreed to end hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (25 March 1802). Bonaparte tried to exploit the brief peace at sea to restore French colonial rule in [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]]. The expedition, though initially successful, would soon turn to a disaster, with the French commander and Bonaparte’s brother-in-law, [[Charles Leclerc]], dying of [[yellow fever]] and almost his entire force destroyed by the disease combined with the fierce attacks by the rebels.

Great Britain violated the terms of the Treaty of Amiens by occupying [[Malta]] and gathered a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] against France. The French intervention in the [[Helvetic Republic|Swiss]] [[Stecklikrieg|civil strife]], a breach of the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) between France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] which guaranteed Swiss sovereignty, was taken as a pretext by the [[United Kingdom]] to break the peace of Amiens and declare war on France on 18 May 1803. The Coalition's war aims changed over the course of the conflict: a general desire to restore the French monarchy became closely linked to the struggle to stop Bonaparte.

Previous wars had seen France lose most of its colonial empire. By 1804 [[Haiti]] had won its independence, the [[Louisiana Territory]] had been sold to the [[United States]] of America, and British naval superiority threatened any potential for France to establish colonies outside Europe. Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as [[Seven Years' War]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} which historians would term a &quot;[[world war]]&quot;.

In response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on the 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the [[Berlin Decree]] on the 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tulard]], ''Napoléon'', Hachette, 2008, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of just 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, whereas France's strength peaked at over 2,500,000, as well as several hundred thousand [[National Guard (France)|national guardsmen]] that Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary; however, British subsidies paid for a large proportion of the soldiers deployed by other coalition powers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers – economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (London 1989), pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy effectively disrupted France's extra-continental trade — both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions — but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. Also, France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain. However, Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. That sufficed to ensure that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. However, many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.

However, in order to mount his invasion, he needed to achieve naval superiority—or at least to pull the British fleet away from the [[English Channel]]. A complex plan to distract the British by threatening their possessions in the [[West Indies]] failed when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles de Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] turned back after an indecisive action off [[battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Cape Finisterre]] on 22 July 1805. The Royal Navy blockaded Villeneuve in [[Cádiz]] until he left for [[Naples]] on 19 October; the British squadron subsequently caught and overwhelmingly defeated his fleet in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October (the British commander, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], died in the battle). Napoleon would never again have the opportunity to challenge the British at sea. By this time, however, Napoleon had already all but abandoned plans to invade Britain, and had again turned his attention to enemies on the Continent. The French army left Boulogne and moved towards Austria.
[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1805.jpg|300px|thumb|left|European strategic situation in 1805 before the War of the Third Coalition]]

In April 1805, the United Kingdom and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing the French from the [[Batavian Republic]] (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]] (Switzerland). Austria joined the alliance after the annexation of [[Genoa]] and the proclamation of Napoleon as [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|King of Italy]] on 17 March 1805. [[Sweden]], which had already agreed to lease [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base for British troops against France, formally entered the coalition on 9 August.

The Austrians began the war by invading [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] with an army of about 70,000 under [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]], and the French army marched out from Boulogne in late July 1805 to confront them. At [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] (25 September&amp;nbsp;– 20 October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without significant losses. With the main Austrian army north of the [[Alps]] defeated (another army under [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]] manoeuvred inconclusively against [[André Masséna]]'s French army in Italy), Napoleon occupied [[Vienna]]. Far from his supply lines, he faced a larger Austro-Russian army under the command of [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], with the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] personally present. On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the joint Austro-Russian army in [[Moravia]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (usually considered his greatest victory). He inflicted a total of 25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer than 7,000 in his own force.

Austria signed the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (26 December 1805) and left the Coalition. The Treaty required the Austrians to give up [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to the French-dominated [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] to Bavaria.

With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play.

==War of the Fourth Coalition 1806–1807==
{{Main|War of the Fourth Coalition}}
[[File:Charles Meynier - Napoleon in Berlin.png|thumb|left|''Napoleon in Berlin'' (Meynier). After defeating Prussian forces at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]], the French Army entered Berlin on 27 October 1806]]

Within months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the [[Fourth Coalition]] (1806–07) against France was formed by Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] out of the many tiny German states which constituted the [[Rhineland]] and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, [[Saxony]] and [[Bavaria]], to the status of kings.

In August 1806, the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]] decided to go to war independently of any other great power except the distant Russia. The Russian army, an ally of Prussia, was still far away when Prussia declared war. In September, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine. Napoleon himself defeated a Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] (14 October 1806), and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] defeated another at [[Battle of Auerstädt|Auerstädt]] on the same day. Some 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners]] 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. Auerstädt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of [[Frederick the Great]] and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, &quot;If he were alive we wouldn't be here today&quot;. In total, Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia until knocking it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerstädt. By contrast, Prussia had fought for three years in the War of the First Coalition with little achievement.
[[File:Friedland mazurovsky.jpg|thumb|Charge of the Russian [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] cavalry against French cuirassiers at the Battle of Friedland, 14 June 1807]]
Saxony quit Prussians and together with small states from north Germany allied with France.

In the next stage of the war the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in Silesia and Pomerania. In the latter were used some Italian and Dutch units too. Then Napoleon turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at [[Königsberg]]. 
A tactical draw at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] (7–8 February 1807), capitulation of [[Siege of Danzig|Danzig]] (24 May 1807) and [[Battle of Heilsberg]] (10 June 1807) forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon then routed the Russian army at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (14 June 1807). Following this defeat, Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland were instituted new states as like [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and [[Republic of Danzig]]. 

By September, [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune|Marshal Brune]] completed the occupation of [[Swedish Pomerania]], allowing the Swedish army, however, to withdraw with all its munitions of war.

During 1807, Britain attacked Denmark and captured its fleet. The large Danish fleet could have greatly aided the French by replacing many of the ships France had lost at Trafalgar in 1805. The British attack helped bring Denmark into the war on the side of France.

At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] (September–October 1808), Napoleon and Alexander agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to the [[Finnish War]] of 1808–09 and to the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The eastern part became the Russian [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].

==War of the Fifth Coalition 1809==
{{Main|War of the Fifth Coalition}}
[[File:Rédition de Madrid 1808.jpg|thumb|''Surrender of Madrid'' (Gros), 1808. Napoleon enters Spain's capital during the Peninsular War]]

The Fifth Coalition (1809) of the United Kingdom and Austria against France formed as the UK engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] against France.

Again the UK stood alone, and the sea became the major [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies.

On land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the [[Walcheren Expedition]] of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]], failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled [[Antwerp]]. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land apart from in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive and would land troops and supplies and aid the Coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. However, the ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives simply because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.
[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1809.jpg|thumb|300px|The European strategic situation in February 1809]]

Economic warfare also continued: the French [[Continental System]] against the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred as French-dominated states engaged in illicit (though often tolerated) trade with British smugglers. Both sides entered additional conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought the United States in the [[War of 1812]] (1812–15), and the French engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] (1808–14). The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with the UK despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the continental system, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied [[Madrid]], and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of popular rebellions across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.

Austria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. Austria achieved a number of initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).

Napoleon had enjoyed easy success in Spain, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and consequently forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula ([[Battle of Corunna]], 16 January 1809). But when he left, the [[guerrilla war]] against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. In his absence the French situation in Spain deteriorated, and then became dire when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]] arrived to take charge of British-Portuguese forces.

The Austrians drove into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], but suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Raszyn]] on 19 April 1809. The Polish army captured [[West Galicia]] following its earlier success.
[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|300px|The French Empire in Europe in 1812, near its peak extent.]] 

Napoleon assumed personal command in the east and bolstered the army there for his counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the [[Danube]] resulted in the massive [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (22 May 1809) — Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], on 5–6 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Marshal Bernadotte]] was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he would actively participate in wars against his former Emperor.)

The War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] (14 October 1809). In the east, only the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]ese rebels led by [[Andreas Hofer]] continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809, while in the west the Peninsular War continued.

In 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. On the continent, the British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around [[Lisbon]] (behind their impregnable [[lines of Torres Vedras]]) and to [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged Cadiz]]. Napoleon married [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]], an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:
* the Kingdom of Spain (under [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's elder brother)
* the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] ([[Jérôme Bonaparte]], Napoleon's younger brother)
* the Kingdom of Naples (under [[Joachim Murat]], husband of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]])
* the [[Principality]] of [[Lucca and Piombino]] (under [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (Napoleon's sister) and her husband [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice Baciocchi]]);
and Napoleon's former enemies, Prussia and Austria.

==The Invasion of Russia 1812==
{{Main|Napoleon's invasion of Russia}}
[[File:Battle of Borodino.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Borodino]] as depicted by [[Louis-François, Baron Lejeune|Louis Lejeune]]. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars.]]
The [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 resulted in the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807-1812)|Anglo-Russian War]] (1807–12). Emperor Alexander I declared war on the United Kingdom after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British [[men-of-war]] supported the Swedish fleet during the [[Finnish War]] and had victories over the Russians in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in July 1808 and August 1809. However, the success of the Russian army on the land forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810 and to join the [[Continental System|Continental Blockade]] against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with the UK effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.

In 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European [[La Grande Armée|''Grande Armée'']], consisting of 650,000 men (270,000 Frenchmen and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). He aimed to compel Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to remain in the Continental System and to remove the imminent threat of a Russian invasion of Poland. The French forces crossed the [[Niemen River]] on 23 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]], while Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion-force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.

The ''Grande Armée'' marched through Russia, winning a number of relatively minor engagements and the major [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]] on 16–18 August. However, in the same days, a part of the French Army led by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]] was stopped in the [[First Battle of Polotsk|Battle of Polotsk]] by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General [[Peter Wittgenstein]]. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]; the fate of the invasion was to be decided in Moscow, where Napoleon himself led his forces.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon]]'s withdrawal from Russia'', a painting by [[Adolph Northen]].]]
Russians used [[scorched-earth]] tactics, and harried the ''Grande Armée'' with light [[Cossack]] cavalry. The ''Grande Armée'' did not adjust its operational methods in response.&lt;ref&gt;Riehn, Richard K. pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt; This refusal led to most of the losses of the main column of the ''Grande Armée'', which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a single week.&lt;ref&gt;Reihn, Richard K, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of [[Field Marshal]] [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] and a veteran, Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], was made the new Commander-in-Chief by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Finally, the two armies engaged in the [[Battle of Borodino]] on 7 September,&lt;ref name=&quot;Riehn, pp. 253–254&quot;&gt;Riehn, pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. The French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army; logistical difficulties meant that French losses were irreplaceable, unlike Russian ones.

Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army retreated yet again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riehn, pp. 253–254&quot;/&gt; But by then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and even released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; furthermore, the governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered the city [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|to be burnt]].&lt;ref&gt;With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt, Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109–107 Pub. William Morrow and Co 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander I refused to capitulate, and the peace talks, attempted by Napoleon, failed. In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.

At the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]] the French tried to reach [[Kaluga]], where they could find food and [[forage]] supplies. But the replenished Russian Army blocked the road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow, through the heavily ravaged areas along the [[Smolensk]] road. In the following weeks, the ''Grande Armée'' was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the [[Russian Winter]], the lack of supplies and constant [[guerilla warfare]] by Russian peasants and irregular troops.

When the remnants of the Napoleon's army [[Battle of Berezina|crossed]] the [[Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers remained, with some 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured.&lt;ref&gt;The Wordsworth Pocket Encyclopedia, page 17, Hertfordshire 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris, to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians, and the campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies.

==War of the Sixth Coalition 1812–1814==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
{{Main|Sixth Coalition}}

Seeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and a number of German states re-entered the war. Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] (2 May 1813) and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] (20–21 May 1813). Both battles involved total forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far.
[[File:MoshkovVI SrazhLeypcigomGRM.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Leipzig]] involved over 600,000 soldiers, making it the largest battle in Europe prior to World War I.]]
Meanwhile, in the [[Peninsular War]], Arthur Wellesley renewed the Anglo-Portuguese advance into Spain just after New Year in 1812, besieging and capturing the fortified towns of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Badajoz]], and in the [[Battle of Salamanca]] (which was a damaging defeat to the French). As the French regrouped, the Anglo–Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of [[Andalusia]] and [[Asturias]].

In a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to Santander. The Anglo–Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against [[Joseph Bonaparte]], finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat out of the Iberian peninsula, over the [[Pyrenees]].

The belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million total men in the preceding two months. During this time Coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding an additional 300,000 men to the Coalition armies in Germany. In total the Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the frontline operations.
[[File:General Nansouty at the battle of Hanau.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Hanau]] (30–31 October 1814), took part between Austro-Bavarian and French forces.]]
Napoleon succeeded in bringing the total imperial forces in the region to around 650,000—although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]] and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]]'s Kingdom of Italy had a total of 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo–Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus in total, around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 Coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany—which left him outnumbered about four to one.

Following the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]] (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior Coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. However, the failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in Saxony (16–19 October 1813), also called the &quot;Battle of the Nations&quot;, 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. Napoleon then fought a series of battles, including the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]], in France itself, but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. His remaining ally [[Denmark-Norway]] became isolated and [[Treaty of Kiel|fell to the coalition]].
[[File:Russparis.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Russian army enters Paris in 1814'']]

The Allies [[Battle of Paris (1814)|entered Paris]] on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his [[Six Days Campaign]], in which he won multiple battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. However, during this entire campaign he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million Coalition soldiers. At the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the Coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.

Napoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his massive fall from power. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these ever materialized, and Napoleon's  schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of the hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. However, occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland throughout the spring of 1814.

The victors exiled Napoleon to the island of [[Elba]], and restored the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. They signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (11 April 1814) and initiated the [[Congress of Vienna]] to redraw the map of Europe.

==Gunboat War 1807–1814==
{{Main|Gunboat War}}

Initially, [[Denmark-Norway]] declared itself [[Armed Neutrality|neutral]] in the Napoleonic Wars, established a navy, and traded with both sides. But the British attacked and captured or destroyed large portions of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]] in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|First Battle of Copenhagen]] (2 April 1801), and again in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]] (August–September 1807). This ended Dano-Norwegian neutrality, beginning an engagement in a naval guerrilla war in which small gunboats would attack larger British ships in Danish and Norwegian waters. The Gunboat War effectively ended with a British victory at the [[Battle of Lyngør]] in 1812, involving the destruction of the last large Dano-Norwegian ship—the [[frigate]] ''[[HDMS Najaden (1811)|Najaden]]''.

==War of 1812==
{{Main|War of 1812}}

Coinciding with the War of the Sixth Coalition, though technically not considered part of the Napoleonic Wars but directly influenced and driven by it, the otherwise neutral United States declared war on the United Kingdom and attempted to invade [[British North America]] (present day Canada). The war ended in the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' under the [[Treaty of Ghent]], signed on 24 December 1814, though sporadic fighting continued for several months (most notably, the [[Battle of New Orleans]]). Apart from the seizing of then-Spanish [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] by the United States, there was negligible involvement from other participants of the broader Napoleonic War. Notably, a series of British raids, later called the [[Burning of Washington]], would result in the burning of the White House, the Capitol, the Navy Yard, and other public buildings. The main effect of the War of 1812 on the wider Napoleonic Wars was to force Britain to divert troops, supplies and funds to defend Canada.

==War of the Seventh Coalition 1815==&lt;!-- [[Battle of Waterloo]] links to this section --&gt;
''See also [[Hundred Days]] and the [[Neapolitan War]] between the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Austrian Empire]]''.

[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|''Wellington at Waterloo'' by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]].]]

The [[Seventh Coalition]] (1815) pitted the United Kingdom, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and a number of German states against France. The period known as the [[Hundred Days]] began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at [[Cannes]] (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew the restored [[Louis XVIII]]. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5&amp;nbsp;million new men into the French army. This faced an initial Coalition force of about 700,000—although Coalition campaign-plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel. The Coalition intended this force to have overwhelming numbers against the numerically inferior imperial French army—which in fact never came close to reaching Napoleon's goal of more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;million under arms.
[[File:Prinsenvlag.svg|thumb|right|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|20px]]The Prince's Flag, was used as a battle flag by the Dutch Forces during the Battle of Waterloo.]]

[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]

Napoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium. He intended to attack the Coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating 3/4 of their Army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the [[Armée du Nord]] to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Hofschroer, pp. 171–191&lt;/ref&gt; He forced Prussia to fight at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]] on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in some disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Hofschroer, pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the left wing of the Armée du Nord, under the command of Marshal [[Michel Ney]], succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Blücher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]]. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an [[escarpment]] at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].

Napoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realize that the Prussian forces were already reorganized and were assembling at the village of Wavre. In any event the French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;Hofschroer, pp 325–330&lt;/ref&gt;  As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards the Battlefield of Waterloo the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen [[Johann von Thielmann|von Thielmann]] in the [[Battle of Wavre]] (18–19 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.

Napoleon delayed the start of fighting at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the Coalition armies divided had failed and a combined Coalition general advance drove his army from the field in confusion.

Grouchy organized a successful and well-ordered retreat towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the 116,000 men of Blücher and Wellington. Militarily, it appeared quite possible that the French could defeat Wellington and Blücher, but politics proved the source of the Emperor's downfall. In any event Davout was defeated at Issy and negotiations for surrender had begun.

On arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance; but the temper of the [[Parliament of France|legislative chamber]]s, and of the public generally, did not favour his view. The politicians forced Napoleon to abdicate again on 22 June 1815. Despite the Emperor’s abdication, irregular warfare continued along the eastern borders and on the outskirts of Paris until the signing of a cease-fire on 4 July. On 15 July, Napoleon surrendered himself to the British squadron at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], where he died on 5 May 1821.

Meanwhile in Italy, [[Joachim Murat]], whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] after Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law, triggering the [[Neapolitan War]] (March to May, 1815). Hoping to find support among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in Italy, Murat issued the [[Rimini Proclamation]] inciting them to war. But the proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the [[Battle of Tolentino]] (2 May to 3 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returned to the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but after that failed, a firing squad executed him on 13 October 1815.

==Political effects==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
[[File:Andrea Appiani 002.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Napoleon as King of Italy ([[Andrea Appiani|Appiani]])]]
The Napoleonic Wars brought great changes both to Europe and the Americas. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one rule—a feat that had not been accomplished since the days of the [[Roman Empire]] (although [[Charlemagne]] had [[Carolingian Empire|nearly done so]] around 800 CE). However, France's constant warfare with the combined forces of the other major powers of Europe for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France no longer held the role of the dominant [[historical powers|power]] in Europe, as it had since the times of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. In its place, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] emerged as by far the most powerful country in the world and the [[Royal Navy]] gained unquestioned naval superiority across the globe. This, coupled with Britain's large and powerful industrial economy, made it perhaps the first truly global superpower and ushered in the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' that lasted for the next 100 years.

In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire bought with it many products of the French Revolution including democracy, [[due process]] in courts, abolition of privileges, etc. The increasing prosperity of the middle classes with rising [[commerce]] and industry meant that restored European monarchs
found it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary [[absolute monarch|absolutism]], and had to retain many of the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to this day in the form of [[Civil Law (legal system)|civil-law]] legal systems, with clearly redacted [[code of law|codes]] compiling their basic laws—an enduring legacy of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Societal legacies are showcased in the way many institutions responded to the people left destitute because of the wars, some of the oldest homeless shelters in London were a direct response to this, such as [[The Society for the Relief of the Homeless Poor]].

During the wake of the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This would shape much of the course future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the hundred years following the [[Napoleonic Era]]. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture. Importantly, Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of the nation-states of Germany and Italy by starting the process of consolidating city-states, kingdoms and principalities.

The Napoleonic wars also played a key role in the independence of the American colonies from their European motherlands. The conflict significantly weakened the authority and military power of the Spanish Empire, especially after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], which seriously hampered the contact of Spain with its American possessions. Evidence of this are the many uprisings in Spanish America after the end of the war, which eventually led to the [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]]. In [[Portuguese America]], Brazil experienced greater autonomy as it now [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|served as seat of the Portuguese Empire]] and ascended politically to the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|status of Kingdom]]. These events also contributed to the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Portuguese Liberal Revolution]] in 1820 and the [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822.

Afterwards, in order to prevent another such war, [[The Congress of Vienna|Europe was divided into states]]  according to the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] theory. This meant that, in theory, no European state would become strong enough to dominate Europe in the future.

Another concept emerged – that of a unified Europe. After his defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful &quot;European association&quot; remained unaccomplished. Such a European association would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency and [[Civil Code]]. Some one-and-a-half centuries later, and after another major conflagration (the [[Second World War]]), several of these ideals re-emerged in the form of the [[European Union]].

==Military legacy==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}

[[File:Jacques-Louis David 008.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'' ([[Jacques-Louis David|David]]). In 1800 Bonaparte took the French Army across the Alps, eventually defeating the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]]]]

The Napoleonic Wars also had a profound military impact. Until the time of Napoleon, European states employed relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. However, military innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognize the potential of an entire nation at war: a &quot;nation in arms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html|title=Napoleon's Total War|publisher=HistoryNet.com|accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France, with one of the largest populations in Europe by the end of the 18th century (27&amp;nbsp;million, as compared to the United Kingdom's 12 million and Russia's 35 to 40&amp;nbsp;million), seemed well poised to take advantage of the ''[[levée en masse]]''. Because the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleon's reign witnessed the first application of the lessons of the 18th century's wars on trade and dynastic disputes, commentators often falsely assume that such ideas arose from the revolution rather than found their implementation in it.

But not all the credit for the innovations of this period go to Napoleon. [[Lazare Carnot]] played a large part in the reorganization of the French army from 1793 to 1794—a time which saw previous French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.

The sizes of the armies involved give an obvious indication of the changes in warfare. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756–1763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000. By contrast, the French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Frenchmen enlisted. In total, about 2.8&amp;nbsp;million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea, bringing the total for France to almost 3 million combatants.

The UK had 747,670 men{{Or|date=November 2011}} under arms between 1792 and 1815. The [[British Army]] expanded from 40,000 men in 1793&lt;ref name=&quot;Chappell8&quot;&gt;Chappell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford132&quot;&gt;Chandler &amp; Beckett, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Over 250,000 personnel served in the [[Royal Navy]]. In September 1812, Russia had about 904,000 enlisted men in its land forces, and between 1799 and 1815 a total of 2.1&amp;nbsp;million men served in the Russian army, with perhaps 400,000 serving from 1792 to 1799. A further 200,000 or so served in the Russian Navy from 1792 to 1815. There are no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at about 576,000 and had little or no naval component. Apart from the UK, Austria proved the most persistent enemy of France, more than a million Austrians served in total. Prussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any time.{{Or|date=February 2011}} Spain's armies also peaked at around 300,000 men, not including a considerable force of [[guerrilla]]s. The United States had over 510,000 combatants. Otherwise only the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederation]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] ever had more than 100,000 men under arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the [[Great Powers]]' forces of past wars. However, one should bear in mind that the above numbers of soldiers come from military records and in practice the actual numbers of fighting men would fall below this level due to desertion, [[fraud]] by officers claiming non-existent soldiers' pay, death and, in some countries, deliberate exaggeration to ensure that forces met enlistment-targets. Despite this, the size of armed forces expanded at this time.
[[File:NapoleonicWars.png|thumb|left|340px|All the participants in the Napoleonic Wars. &lt;span style=&quot;color:Blue;&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;: The Coalition and their colonies and allies. &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green;&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;: The [[First French Empire]], its protectorates and colonies, and allies.]]

The initial stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]] had much to do with larger military forces—it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip significantly larger forces. The UK served as the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period, supplying most of the weapons used by the Coalition powers throughout the conflicts (although using relatively few itself). France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and other allies.

Napoleon himself showed innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, as brilliantly demonstrated in the rout of the Austro-Russian forces in 1805 in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. The French Army reorganized the role of [[artillery]], forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of attaching artillery pieces in support of troops. Napoleon standardized [[round shot|cannonball]] sizes to ensure easier resupply and compatibility among his army's artillery pieces. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Another advance affected warfare: the [[Semaphore line|semaphore system]] had allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on the frontiers throughout the 1790s. The French continued to use this system throughout the Napoleonic wars. Additionally, [[aerial surveillance]] came into use for the first time when the French used a hot-air balloon to survey Coalition positions before the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], on 26 June 1794. Advances in [[Weapon|ordnance]] and [[rocket]]ry also occurred in the course of the conflict.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
