After the success of the [[Crusades|crusade]], the German- and Danish-occupied territory was divided into six feudal principalities by [[William of Modena]].

==History==
===War against Livs and Latgalians (1198–1209)===
[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|200px|left|[[Baltic Tribes]], ca 1200.]]
{{History of Estonia}}

Christianity had come to [[Latvia]] with the [[Swedes]] in the 9th century and the [[Danes]] in the 11th. By the time [[Germans|German]] traders began to arrive in the second half of the 12th century to trade along the ancient Daugava-Dnieper route to [[Byzantium]], many Latvians had already been baptized. [[Meinhard of Segeberg]] arrived in Livland (as it was named in German) in 1184 with the mission of converting the pagan Livonians, and was consecrated as its bishop in 1186.

The indigenous [[Livonians]] (Livs), who had been paying tribute to the [[East Slavic peoples|East Slavic]] [[Principality of Polotsk]], and were often under attack by their southern neighbours the  [[Semigallians]], at first considered the Low Germans ([[Saxons]]) to be useful allies. The first prominent Livonian to be converted was their leader [[Caupo of Turaida]], who was baptized around 1189.

[[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagans]] in [[Northern Europe]] in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, the impatient Meinhard plotted to convert the Livonians forcibly, but was thwarted. He died in 1196, having failed his mission. His appointed replacement, bishop Berthold of Hanover, arrived with a large contingent of crusaders in 1198. Shortly afterward, while riding ahead of his troops in battle, Berthold was surrounded and killed, and his forces defeated.

To avenge Berthold's defeat, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a bull declaring a crusade against the Livonians. [[Albert of Riga|Albrecht von Buxthoeven]], consecrated as bishop in 1199, arrived the following year with a large force, and established Riga as the seat of his [[Bishopric of Riga|bishopric]] in 1201. In 1202 he formed the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] to aid in the conversion of the pagans to Christianity and, more importantly, to protect German trade and secure German control over commerce. 

As the German grip tightened, the Livonians and their christened chief rebelled against the crusaders. Caupo's forces were defeated at Turaida in 1206, and the Livonians were declared to be converted. Caupo subsequently remained an ally of the crusaders until his death in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] in 1217.

By 1208 the important Daugava trading posts of [[Salaspils]] (Holme), [[Koknese]] (Kokenhusen) and [[Sēlpils]] (Selburg) had been taken over as a result of Albert's energetic campaigning. In the same year, the rulers of the Latgalian counties [[Tālava]], [[Satekle]], and [[Autine]] established military alliances with the Order, and construction began on both [[Cēsis]] (Wenden) castle and a stone castle in [[Koknese]], where the [[Daugava]] and [[Pērse]] rivers meet, replacing the wooden castle of the Latgalians. In 1209 Albert, leading the forces of the Order, captured the capital of the Latgalian principality of [[Jersika]], and took the wife of the ruler Visvaldis captive. Visvaldis was forced to submit his kingdom to Albert as a grant to the [[Archbishopric of Riga]], and received back only a portion of it as a fief. Tālava, weakened in wars with Estonians and Russians, became a [[vassal state]] of the Archbishopric of Riga in 1214, and in 1224 was finally divided between the Archbishopric and the Order.

===War against Estonians (1208–1227)===
[[File:Ancient Estonian counties.png|thumb|200px|left|Counties of [[Ancient Estonia]]]]
By 1208 the Crusaders were strong enough to begin operations against the [[Estonians]], who were at that time divided into eight major and seven smaller [[List_of_rulers_of_Estonia#Ancient_Counties_and_Parishes|Counties]], led by elders, with limited co-operation between them. With the help of the newly converted local tribes of Livs and [[Latgalians]], the crusaders initiated raids into [[Sakala County|Sakala]] and [[Ugaunia]] in Southern Estonia. The Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1208–27, war parties of the different sides rampaged through [[Livonia]], Latgalia, and other Estonian counties, with the Livs, Latgalians and [[Russians]] of the [[Republic of Novgorod]] serving variously as allies of both crusaders and Estonians. [[Hill fort]]s, which were the key centers of Estonian counties, were besieged, captured, and re-captured a number of times. A truce between the war-weary sides was established for three years (1213–1215). It proved generally more favourable to the Germans, who consolidated their political position, while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state. They were led by [[Lembitu of Lehola]], the elder of [[Sackalia]], who by 1211 had come to the attention of German chroniclers as the central figure of the Estonian resistance. The Livonian leader Caupo was killed in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] near [[Viljandi|Viljandi (Fellin)]] on September 21, 1217, but Lembitu was also killed, and the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians.
{{History of Latvia}}
[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]], 1219.]]
The Christian kingdoms of [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] were also eager for expansion on the eastern shores of the Baltic. In 1218 Albert asked King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] for assistance, but Valdemar instead arranged a deal with the Order. The king was victorious in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]] in [[Revelia]] in 1219, to which the origin of the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] is attributed. He subsequently founded the fortress [[Castrum Danorum]], which was unsuccessfully besieged by the Estonians in 1220 and 1223. King [[John I of Sweden]] tried to establish a [[Sweden|Swedish]] presence in the province of [[Lääne County|Wiek]], but his troops were defeated by the [[Oeselians]] in the [[Battle of Lihula]] in 1220. Revelia, [[Harrien]], and [[Vironia]], the whole of northern Estonia, fell to Danish control. 

During the uprising of 1223, all Christian strongholds in Estonia save [[Tallinn]] fell into Estonian hands, with their defenders killed. By 1224 all of the larger fortresses were reconquered by the crusaders, except for [[Tartu|Tharbata]], which was defended by a determined Estonian garrison and 200 Russian mercenaries. The leader of the Russian troops was [[Vyachko]], to whom the [[Novgorod Republic]] had promised the fortress and its surrounding lands &quot;if he could conquer them for himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tarvel, Enn (ed.). 1982. ''Henriku Liivimaa kroonika. Heinrici Chronicon Livoniae.'' p. 246. Tallinn: Eesti Raamat.&lt;/ref&gt; Tharbata was finally captured by the crusaders in August 1224 and all its defenders killed. Early in 1224 Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] had announced at [[Catania]] that Livonia, [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], [[Sambia]] and a number of neighboring provinces would henceforth be considered ''[[Reichsfreiheit|reichsfrei]]'', that is, subordinate directly to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] only, as opposed to being under the jurisdiction of local rulers. At the end of the year [[Pope Honorius III]] announced the appointment of Bishop [[William of Modena]] as [[papal legate]] for Livonia, Prussia, and other countries.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In 1224 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword established their headquarters at [[Viljandi|Fellin (Viljandi)]] in Sackalia, where the walls of the Master's castle are still standing. Other strongholds included [[Cēsis|Wenden (Cēsis)]], [[Sigulda|Segewold (Sigulda)]], and [[Aizkraukle|Ascheraden (Aizkraukle)]]. 
The [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]], one of the greatest medieval narratives, was written probably as a report for William of Modena, giving him the history of the Church in Livonia up to his time. It relates how in 1226, in the stronghold [[Tarwanpe]], William of Modena successfully mediated a peace between the Germans, the Danes and the [[Vironians]].

====War against Saaremaa (1206–1261)====
{{See|Oeselians}}
[[File:OeselLivTrty1241.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The 1241 Treaty between [[Livonian Order]], [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]] and [[Oeselians]] at [[National Archives of Sweden]]]]
The last Estonian county to hold out against the invaders was the island country of [[Saaremaa|Saaremaa (Ösel)]], whose war fleets had continued to raid Denmark and Sweden during the years of fighting against the German crusaders.

In 1206, a Danish army led by king [[Valdemar II]] and [[Anders Sunesen|Andreas, the Bishop of Lund]], landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold, without success. In 1216 the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea. The Oeselians retaliated by raiding German-held territories in Latvia the following spring. In 1220 a Swedish army led by king [[John I of Sweden]] and the bishop [[Karl Magnusson (Bjälboätten)|Karl of Linköping]] captured [[Lihula]] in [[Rotalia]] in Western Estonia. The Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold later the same year and killed the entire garrison, including the Bishop of Linköping. 

In 1222, the Danish king [[Valdemar II]] attempted a second conquest of Saaremaa, this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison. The  stronghold was besieged and surrendered within five days, the Danish garrison returning to [[Reval|Revel]] while leaving Bishop [[Albert of Riga]]'s brother Theodoric and others behind as hostages for peace. The castle was leveled by the Oeselians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GNBNHgAACAAJ&amp;dq The Baltic Crusade By William L. Urban; p 113–114] ISBN 0-929700-10-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1227, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the town of [[Riga]], and the [[Bishop of Riga]] organized a combined attack against Saaremaa. After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds, [[Muhu]] and [[Valjala]], the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity.

After the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the [[Battle of Saule]] in 1236 fighting again broke out on Saaremaa. 

In 1241 the Oeselians once again accepted [[Christianity]] by signing treaties with the [[Livonian Order]]'s Master Andreas de Velven and the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]]. This was followed by a treaty signed in 1255 by the Master of the Order, Anno Sangerhausenn, and, on behalf of the Oeselians, elders whose names were phonetically transcribed by Latin scribes as Ylle, Culle, Enu, Muntelene, Tappete, Yalde, Melete, and Cake &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?ei=5T5NR8i7Gp_QpwLvvNn3Bg&amp;id=aTouAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ylle+culle+muntelene&amp;q=Ylle+Culle&amp;pgis=1#search  Liv-, est- und kurländisches Urkundenbuch: Nebst Regesten]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty granted the Oeselians several distinctive rights regarding the ownership and inheritance of land, the social order, and the practice of religion. 

Warfare erupted in 1261 as the Oeselians once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island. A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the [[Livonian Order]], the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]], and [[Danish Estonia]], including  mainland Estonians and Latvians, defeated the Oeselians by capturing their stronghold at Kaarma. Soon thereafter, the [[Livonian Order]] established a stone fort at [[Pöide Parish|Pöide]]. 

On July 24, 1343, the Oeselians arose yet again, killing all the Germans on the island, drowning all the clerics, and besieging the [[Livonian Order]]'s castle at Pöide. After the garrison surrendered the Oeselians massacred the defenders and destroyed the castle. In February 1344 [[Burchard von Dreileben]] led a campaign over the frozen sea to Saaremaa. The Oeselians' stronghold was conquered and their leader Vesse was hanged. In the early spring of 1345, the next campaign of the [[Livonian Order]] ended with a treaty mentioned in the Chronicle of [[Hermann von Wartberge]] and the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]]. Saaremaa remained the vassal of the master of the [[Livonian Order]] and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek until 1559.

===Wars against Curonians and Semigallians (1219–1290)===
[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|left|200px|thumb|[[Medieval Livonia]], ca. 1260.]]
Following the defeat of the Estonians, the crusade moved against the [[Curonians]] (1242–1267) and [[Semigallians]] (1219–1290), [[Balts|Baltic]] tribes living to the south and west of the [[Daugava]] river and closely allied with the [[Samogitians]].

After the defeat in the [[Battle of Saule]] by Samogitians and Semigallians, the remnants of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were reorganised in 1237, as a subdivision of the [[Teutonic Order]] and became known as the [[Livonian Order]]. The [[Battle of Durbe]] was another victory of Samogitians and allied Curonians over the united forces of Livonian and Teutonic Orders in 1260. Crusaders finally overpowered the [[Curonians]] in 1267, and despite of severe defeat in the [[Battle of Garoza]] in 1287, subsequently the [[Semigallians]] in 1290. The unconquered southern parts of their territories ([[Sidrabe]], [[Rakte]], [[Ceklis]], [[Megava]] etc.) were united under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Aftermath==

After the conquest, all remaining local pagans were ostensibly [[Christianity|Christianized]] although no Christian literature or [[church service]]s became available in native languages until the [[Protestant Reformation]] period in the 16th century.

The land was divided into six feodal principalities by [[Papal Legate]] [[William of Modena]]: [[Archbishopric of Riga]], [[Bishopric of Courland]], [[Bishopric of Dorpat]], [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]], the lands ruled by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and [[Dominum directum]] of [[King of Denmark]], the [[Danish_Estonia#Duchy_of_Estonia|Duchy of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Northern Crusades |last=Christiansen |first=Eric |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0-14-026653-4 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W02ZZFqP1JcC&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Prehistory to 1520 |last=Knut |first=Helle |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-47299-7 |pages=269 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PFBtfXG6fXAC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;vq=Duchy+of+Estonia&amp;dq=%22Duchy+of+Estonia%22&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ZqeL3WfxncxJEpJV7Jj0jMKw6Xg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In 1227 the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] conquered all Danish territories in Northern Estonia. After the [[Battle of Saule]] the surviving members of the Brothers of the Sword merged into the [[Teutonic Order]] of Prussia in 1237 and became known as [[Livonian Order]]. On 7 June 1238 by the Treaty of Stensby the Teutonic knights returned the Duchy of Estonia to Valdemar II, until in 1346, after [[St. George's Night Uprising]], the lands were sold back to the order and became part of the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Ordenstaat]].
