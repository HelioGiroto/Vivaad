      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17680">{{History of Tanzania}}
People have lived in '''[[Zanzibar]]''' for 20,000 years; [[history]] proper starts when the islands became a base for traders voyaging between [[Arabia]], [[India]], and [[Africa]]. [[Unguja]] offered a protected and defensible harbour, so although the archipelago had few products of value, Arabs settled at what became [[Zanzibar City]] (Stone Town) as a convenient point from which to trade with [[East Africa]]n coastal towns. They established garrisons on the islands and built the first [[mosque]] in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. 

During the [[Age of Exploration]], the [[Portuguese Empire]] was the first European power to gain control of Zanzibar, and kept it for nearly 200 years. In 1698 Zanzibar fell under the control of the [[Sultanate of Oman]], which developed an economy of trade and [[cash crop]]s, with a ruling Arab elite. Plantations were developed to grow spices, hence the moniker of the '''Spice Islands''' (a name also used of [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colony]] the [[Moluccas]], now part of [[Indonesia]]). Another major trade good was [[ivory trade|ivory]], the tusks of elephants killed in mainland Africa. The third pillar of the economy was slaves, giving Zanzibar an important place in the [[Arab slave trade]], the [[Indian Ocean]] equivalent of the better-known [[Triangular Trade]]. The [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] controlled a substantial portion of the East African coast, known as [[Zanj]], and extensive inland trading routes.

Sometimes gradually, sometimes by fits and starts, control came into the hands of the [[British Empire]]; part of the political impetus for this was the movement for the [[abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]]. In 1890 Zanzibar became a British [[protectorate]]. The death of one sultan and the succession of another of whom the British did not approve led to the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]], also known as the shortest war in history. 

The islands gained independence from Britain in December 1963 as a [[constitutional monarchy]]. A month later, the bloody [[Zanzibar Revolution]], in which several thousand Arabs and Indians were killed and thousands more expelled and expropriated, led to the [[Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba]]. That April, the republic merged with the mainland [[Tanganyika]], or more accurately, was subsumed into [[Tanzania]], of which Zanzibar remains a semi-autonomous region. Zanzibar was most recently in the international news with a January 2001 massacre, following contested elections.

== Prehistory ==
Zanzibar has been inhabited, perhaps not continuously, since the [[Paleolithic]]. A 2005 excavation at Kuumbi Cave in southeastern Zanzibar found heavy duty stone tools that showed occupation of the site at least 22,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:47830 &quot;Excavations at Kuumbi Cave on Zanzibar 2005&quot;, ''The African Archaeology Network: Research in Progress'', Paul Sinclair (Uppsala University), Abdurahman Juma, Felix Chami, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries of a limestone cave used [[radiocarbon]] techniques to prove more recent occupation, from around [[2800 BC]] to the year 0 (Chami 2006). Traces of the communities include objects such as [[glass bead]]s from around the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is a suggestion of early trans-oceanic trade networks, although some writers have expressed pessimism about this possibility.

No cave sites on Zanzibar have revealed pottery fragments used by early and later [[Bantu people|Bantu]] farming and iron-working communities who lived on the islands (Zanzibar, Mafia) during the first millennium [[AD]]. On Zanzibar, the evidence for the later farming and iron-working communities dating from the mid-first millennium AD is much stronger and indicates the beginning of urbanism there when settlements were built with mud-timber structures (Juma 2004). This is somewhat earlier than the existing evidence for towns in other parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast, given as the 9th century AD. The first permanent residents of Zanzibar seem to have been the ancestors of the [[Hadimu]] and [[Tumbatu]], who began arriving from the East African mainland around 1000 AD. They had belonged to various mainland ethnic groups, and on Zanzibar they lived in small villages and failed to coalesce to form larger political units. Because they lacked central organization, they were easily subjugated by outsiders.

Traders from [[Arabia]] (mostly [[Yemen]]), the [[Persian Gulf]] region of [[Iran]] (especially [[Shiraz]]), and [[west India]] probably visited Zanzibar as early as the 1st century AD. They used the [[monsoon]] winds to sail across the Indian Ocean and landed at the sheltered harbor located on the site of present-day [[Zanzibar Town]]. Although the islands had few resources of interest to the traders, they offered a good location from which to make contact and trade with the towns of the East African coast. A phase of [[urban development]] associated with the introduction of stone material to the construction industry of the East African coast began from the 10th century AD. 

Traders began to settle in small numbers on Zanzibar in the late 11th or 12th century, [[interracial marriage|intermarrying]] with the indigenous Africans. Eventually a hereditary ruler (known as the ''Mwenyi Mkuu'' or ''[[Jumbe]]''), emerged among the [[Hadimu]], and a similar ruler, called the ''Sheha'', was set up among the [[Tumbatu]]. Neither had much power, but they helped solidify the [[ethnic identity]] of their respective peoples.

The Yemenis built the earliest [[mosque]] in the [[southern hemisphere]] in [[Kizimkazi]], the southernmost village in [[Unguja]]. A [[kufic]] inscription on its ''mihrab'' bears the date [[Islamic calendar|AH]] 500, i.e. 1107 AD.

Villages were also present in which lineage groups were common.

== Portuguese rule ==
[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1499 marked the beginning of European influence. In 1503 or 1504, Zanzibar became part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] when Captain Ruy Lourenço Ravasco Marques landed and demanded and received tribute from the sultan in exchange for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oYhrCkGaxyUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Zanzibar: Its History and Its People'', W. H. Ingrams, Frank Cass and Company Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom, 1931, page 99]&lt;/ref&gt; Zanzibar remained a possession of Portugal for almost two centuries.

== Later Arab rule ==
{{Main|Zanzibar Sultanate}}

[[File:Stone Town, fort.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Fort of Zanzibar]] built in the late 17th century by the [[Omanis]] to defend the island from the Portuguese.]]
In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of [[Oman]], falling under the control of the [[Sultan of Oman]]. The Portuguese were expelled and a lucrative trade in slaves and ivory thrived, along with an expanding [[plantation economy]] centring on cloves. The Arabs established garrisons at Zanzibar, [[Pemba, Tanzania|Pemba]], and [[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]]. The height of Arab rule came during the reign of [[Said bin Sultan|Seyyid Said]] (more fully, Sayyid Said bin Sultan al-Busaid), who in 1840 moved his capital from [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in Oman to [[Stone Town]]. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove [[plantation]]s, using the island's [[slave labour]]. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, his sons struggled over the [[Order of succession|succession]]. On April 6, 1861, Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate [[principalities]]. [[Sayyid Majid bin Said Al-Busaid]] (1834/5–1870), his sixth son, became the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]], while the third son, [[Thuwaini bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sayyid Thuwaini bin Said al-Said]], became the Sultan of Oman. 

The Sultan of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the east African coast, known as [[Zanj]], and [[trading route]]s extending much further across the continent, as far as [[Kindu]] on the [[Congo River]]. In November 1886, a German-British border commission established the Zanj as a ten-nautical mile (19&amp;nbsp;km) wide strip along most of the coast of East Africa, stretching from [[Cape Delgado]] (now in [[Mozambique]]) to [[Kipini]] (now in [[Kenya]]), including [[Mombasa]] and [[Dar es Salaam]], all offshore islands, and several towns in what is now [[Somalia]]. However, from 1887 to 1892, all of these mainland possessions were lost to the colonial powers of the United Kingdom, [[Germany]], and [[Italy]], although some were not formally sold or ceded until the 20th century ([[Mogadishu]] to Italy in 1905 and Mombasa to Britain in 1963).

Zanzibar was famous worldwide for its spices and its slaves. It was East Africa's main slave-trading port, and in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through the [[slave market]]s of Zanzibar each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html National Geographic article&lt;/ref&gt; ([[David Livingstone]] estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the island.) [[Tippu Tip]] was the most notorious slaver, under several sultans, and also a trader, plantation owner and governor. Zanzibar's spices attracted ships from as far away as the [[United States]], which established a consulate in 1837. The [[United Kingdom]]'s early interest in Zanzibar was motivated by both commerce and the determination to end the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6510675.stm Remembering East African slave raids&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, the British signed the first of a series of treaties with Sultan Said to [[abolitionism|curb this trade]], but not until 1876 was the sale of slaves finally prohibited.

Zanzibar had the distinction of having the first [[steam locomotive]] in East Africa, when [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Bargash bin Said]] ordered a tiny [[0-4-0]] [[tank engine]] to haul his regal carriage from town to his summer palace at [[Chukwani]].

== British influence and rule ==
[[File:Zanzibar 1900 to 1920.jpg|thumb|A Zanzibar marketplace, around 1910. A British colonist can be seen in the middle, wearing a linen suit and a [[Pith helmet]].]]
The [[British Empire]] gradually took over; the relationship was formalised by the 1890 [[Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty]], in which Germany pledged, among other things, not to interfere with British interests in Zanzibar. This treaty made Zanzibar and Pemba a British [[protectorate]] (not [[colony]]), and the [[Caprivi Strip]] (in what is now [[Namibia]]) a German protectorate. British rule through a sultan ([[vizier]]) remained largely unchanged.

The death of [[Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 saw the [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Bargash]], eldest son of the second sultan, [[Barghash ibn Sa'id]], take over the palace and declare himself the new ruler. This was contrary to the wishes of the [[British government]], which favoured [[Hamoud bin Mohammed]]. This led to a showdown, later called the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]], on the morning of 27 August, when ships of the [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the Beit al Hukum Palace, having given Khalid a one-hour ultimatum to leave. He refused, and at 9 am the ships opened fire. Khalid's troops returned fire and he fled to the German consulate. A [[cease fire]] was declared 45 minutes after the action had begun, giving the bombardment the title of The Shortest War in History. Hamoud was declared the new ruler and peace was restored once more. Acquiescing to British demands, he brought an end in 1897 to Zanzibar's role as a centre for the centuries-old eastern slave trade by banning slavery and freeing the slaves, compensating their owners. Hamoud's son and [[heir apparent]], [[Ali bin Hamud of Zanzibar|Ali]], was educated in Britain.

From 1913 until independence in 1963, the British appointed their own residents (essentially [[governor]]s).

== Independence and revolution ==
{{Main|Zanzibar revolution}}
[[File:Dares 222.jpg|thumb|The Sultan's Palace.]]
[[File:Zanzibar, 12 Jan. 2004, celebration of 40 years' Revolution.JPG|thumb|Ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] in 2004.]]
On 10 December 1963, Zanzibar received its independence from the United Kingdom as a [[constitutional monarchy]] under the Sultan. This state of affairs was short-lived, as the Sultan and the democratically elected government were overthrown on 12 January 1964 in the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] led by [[John Okello]], a [[Uganda]]n citizen. Sheikh [[Abeid Amani Karume]] was named President of the newly created [[People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba]]. Several thousand Arabs (5,000-12,000 Zanzibaris of Arabic descent) and Indians were killed, thousands more detained or expelled, their property either confiscated or destroyed. The film ''[[Africa Addio]]'' documents the revolution, including a massacre of Arabs. (Ethnic difference, and the expulsion of those who had anywhere else to go, were repeated themes in [[East Africa]], the most prominent example being the [[Expulsion of Indians in Uganda in 1972]] by [[Idi Amin]].)

The revolutionary government nationalized the local operations of the two foreign banks in Zanzibar, [[Standard Bank (historic)|Standard Bank]] and [[National and Grindlays Bank]].  These nationalized operations may have provided the foundation for the newly-created [[Peoples Bank of Zanzibar]]. [[Jetha Lila]], the one locally-owned bank in Zanzibar, or for that matter in all of [[East Africa]], closed.  It was owned by Indians and though the revolutionary government of Zanzibar urged it to continue functioning, the loss of its customer base as [[Indian diaspora in East Africa|Indians]] left the island made it impossible to continue.

== Union with Tanganyika ==
On 26 April 1964, the mainland colony of [[Tanganyika]] united with Zanzibar to form the [[United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar]]; this lengthy name was compressed into a [[portmanteau]], the United Republic of [[Tanzania]], on 29 October 1964. After unification, local affairs were controlled by President [[Abeid Amani Karume]], while foreign affairs were handled by the United Republic in [[Dar es Salaam]]. Zanzibar remains a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania.

From this point onwards, see [[History of Tanzania]].
