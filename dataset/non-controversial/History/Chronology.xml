'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}}, ''chronos'', &quot;time&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]], such as the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also &quot;the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;Memidex/WordNet, &quot;chronology,&quot; [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]] (see [[#Prehistoric chronologies|Prehistoric chronologies]] below).

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time, basically a time line and is distinct from, but relies upon [[chronometry]] or timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{calendars}}
{{Main|Calendar}}
The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the 8th century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as &quot;From the city having been founded&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD) but does not exactly coincide with the year 1 BC. Astronomers never preposed seriously to replace our era with their astronomical era (which for that matter coincides exactly with the Christian era where it concerns the calendar years ''after'' the year 4).

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king list]]s, late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: &quot;The [[Beaker People]]&quot; in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne | month =November | year =2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological analysis==
Several legendary sources tend to assign unrealistically long lifespans to pre-historical heroes and monarchs (''e.g.'', Egyptian, Chinese, Hebrews, Japanese), if the number of years there reported are understood as years of more than 340 days. Though chronologies formulated before the 1960s are subject to serious skepticism today, more recent results are more robust than readily appears to journalists and enthusiastic amateurs. [[Bayesian inference]] can be applied in the analysis of chronological information, including radiocarbon-derived dates.
