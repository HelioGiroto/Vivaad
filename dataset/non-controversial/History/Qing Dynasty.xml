{{History of China}}

The '''Qing Dynasty''', also '''Empire of the Great Qing''' or '''Great Qing''', was the last imperial [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of [[China]], ruling from 1644 to 1912 with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917. It was preceded by the [[Ming Dynasty]] and followed by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

The dynasty was founded by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan in contemporary [[Northeastern China]]. The Aisin Gioro leader, [[Nurhachi]], who was originally a vassal of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming emperors]], began unifying the Jurchen clans in the late sixteenth century. By 1635, Nurhachi's son [[Hong Taiji]] could claim they constituted a single and united [[Manchu people]] and began forcing the Ming out of [[Liaoning]] in southern [[Manchuria]].  In 1644, the Ming capital [[Beijing]] was sacked by a peasant revolt led by [[Li Zicheng]], a former minor Ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt, who then proclaimed the [[Shun dynasty]]. The last Ming ruler, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], [[Guilty Chinese Scholartree|committed suicide]] when the city fell. When Li Zicheng moved against Ming general [[Wu Sangui]],  the latter made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the [[Shanhai Pass]] to the Manchurian army. Under Prince [[Dorgon]], they seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng's short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]]. Complete pacification of China was accomplished around 1683 under the [[Kangxi Emperor]].

Over the course of its reign, the Qing became highly integrated with [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]]. The [[imperial examination]]s continued and Han civil servants administered the empire alongside Manchu ones. The Qing reached its height under the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in the eighteenth century, expanding beyond China's prior and later boundaries. Imperial corruption exemplified by the minister [[Heshen]] and a series of rebellions, natural disasters, and defeats in wars against European powers gravely weakened the Qing during the nineteenth century. &quot;[[Unequal Treaties]]&quot; provided for [[extraterritoriality]] and removed large areas of [[treaty ports]] from Chinese sovereignty. The government attempts to modernize during the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] in the late 19th century yielded few lasting results. Losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–1895 was a watershed for the Qing government and the result demonstrated that reform had modernized Japan significantly since the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1867, especially as compared with the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] in China.

The 1911 [[Wuchang Uprising]] of the New Army ended with the overthrow of the [[Empress Dowager Longyu]] and the infant [[Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. Despite the declaration of the [[Republic of China (1912&amp;ndash;1949)|Republic of China]], the generals would continue to fight amongst themselves for the next several decades during the [[Warlord Era]]. [[Puyi]] was briefly restored to power in [[Beijing]] by [[Zhang Xun (Republic of China)|Zhang Xun]] in July 1917, and in [[Manchukuo]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] between 1932 and 1945.

==Name==
Both in honor of the earlier Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in the 12-13th century and his [[Aisin Gioro]] clan (''Aisin'' being the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] {{linktext|金}} (''jīn'', &quot;gold&quot;)) [[Nurhachi]] originally named his state the ''Great Jin'' (&lt;small&gt;lit&lt;/small&gt; &quot;Gold&quot;) dynasty, afterwards called the ''Later Jin Dynasty'' by historians. His son [[Hong Taiji]] renamed the dynasty ''Great Qing'' (&lt;small&gt;lit&lt;/small&gt; &quot;Clarity&quot;) in 1636. The name &quot;Qing&quot; was selected in reaction to the name of the Ming Dynasty ({{linktext|明}}) which consists of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for &quot;sun&quot; ({{linktext|日}}) and &quot;moon&quot; ({{linktext|月}}), both associated with the fire [[Wu Xing|element]]. The character Qing ({{linktext|清}}) is composed of &quot;water&quot; ({{linktext|氵}}) and &quot;azure&quot; ({{linktext|青}}), both associated with the water element. This association would explain the Qing conquest through defeat of fire by water. The water imagery of the new name may also have had Buddhist overtones of perspicacity and enlightenment and connections with the Bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley. ''The Manchus''. Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1997), 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state was known internationally as '''China''',&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Treaty of Nanking|Treaty of Nanking]]. 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Chinese Empire'''&lt;ref&gt;[[William McKinley|McKinley, William]]. &quot;[[s:William McKinley's Second State of the Union Address|Second State of the Union Address]]&quot;. 5 Dec. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; and considered to comprise [[China Proper|China proper or the Eighteen provinces]], [[Chinese Tartary]], [[Chinese Turkestan]], and [[Tibet]]. It was also known in the romanization of the time as the ''Ta Tsing Empire''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Treaty of Tien-Tsin between the United States of America and the Empire of China|Sino-American Treaty of Tien-Tsin]]. 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burlingame&quot;&gt;[[s:Burlingame Treaty|Burlingame Treaty]]. 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Chinese for &quot;Empire of the Great Qing&quot; ({{linktext|大|清|帝国}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Dà Qīng Dìguó'').

== History ==

=== Formation of the Manchu state ===
[[File:CEM-36-Regno-di-Nivche-2429.jpg|thumb|left|An Italian map showing the &quot;Kingdom of the [[Jurchen people|Nüzhen]]&quot; or the &quot;[[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] Tartars&quot;, who &quot;have occupied and are at present ruling China&quot;, north of [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]] and [[Korea]], published in 1682]]

The Qing Dynasty was founded not by [[Han Chinese]], who form the majority of the Chinese population, but by a semi-sedentary people known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], a [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic people]] who lived around the region now comprising the Chinese provinces of [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey(1999), p.220&lt;/ref&gt; What was to become the Manchu state was founded by [[Nurhachi]], the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribe{{spaced ndash}}the [[Aisin Gioro]]{{spaced ndash}}in [[Jianzhou Jurchens|Jianzhou]] in the early 17th century. Originally a vassal of the Ming emperors, Nurhachi embarked on an inter-tribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes. By 1616, he had sufficiently consolidated Jianzhou so as to be able to proclaim himself [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Great Jin]] in reference to the previous Jurchen dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patricia Buckley Ebrey 2010 pp. 220-224&quot;&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,  2nd,  2010), pp. 220-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Nurhachi announced the &quot;[[Seven Grievances]]&quot; and openly renounced the sovereignty of Ming overlordship in order to complete the unification of those Jurchen tribes still allied with the Ming emperor. After a series of successful battles, he relocated his capital from [[Hetu Ala]] to successively bigger captured Ming cities in [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]] Province: first [[Liaoyang]] in 1621, then [[Shenyang]] (Mukden) in 1625.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patricia Buckley Ebrey 2010 pp. 220-224&quot;/&gt;

Relocating his court from Jianzhou to Liaodong provided Nurhachi access to more resources; it also brought him in close contact with the [[Mongols|Mongol]] domains on the plains of Mongolia. Although by this time the once-united Mongol nation had long since fragmented into individual and hostile tribes, these tribes still presented a serious security threat to the Ming borders. Nurhachi's policy towards the Mongols was to seek their friendship and cooperation against the Ming, securing his western border from a powerful potential enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Hung-Kay Luk p.25&quot;&gt;Bernard Hung-Kay Luk, Amir Harrak-Contacts between cultures, Volume 4, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Mongols proved a useful ally in the war, lending the Jurchens their expertise as cavalry archers. To cement this new alliance, Nurhachi initiated a policy of inter-marriages between the Jurchen and Mongol nobilities, while those who resisted were met with military action. This is a typical example of Nurhachi's initiatives that eventually became official Qing government policy. During most of the Qing Dynasty time, the Mongols gave military assistance to the Manchus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Hung-Kay Luk p.25&quot;/&gt;

Some of Nurhachi's other important contributions include ordering the creation of a written [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu script]] based on the [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] so as to avoid the earlier [[Jurchen script]] which had been derived from [[Khitan scripts|Khitan]] and [[Chinese character|Chinese]] and the creation of the civil and military administrative system which eventually evolved into the [[Eight Banners]], the defining element of Manchu identity and the foundation for transforming the loosely knitted Jurchen tribes into a nation.

[[File:SNV30920.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Qing Dynasty era brush container]]
Nurhachi's unbroken series of military successes came to an end in January 1626 when he was defeated by [[Yuan Chonghuan]] while laying siege to [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ningyuan]]. He died a few months later and was succeeded by his eighth son, [[Hong Taiji]], who emerged after a short political struggle amongst other potential contenders as the new Khan.

Although Hong Taiji was an experienced leader and the commander of two Banners at the time of his succession, his reign did not start well on the military front. The Jurchens suffered yet another defeat in 1627 at the hands of Yuan Chonghuan. As before, this defeat was, in part, due to Ming's newly acquired Portuguese cannons.

To redress the technological and numerical disparity, Hong Taiji in 1634 created his own artillery corps, the ''ujen chooha'', [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{linktext|重|軍}} from among his existing Han troops who cast their own cannons in the European design with the help of captured Chinese metallurgists. In 1635, the Manchus' Mongol allies were fully incorporated into a separate Banner hierarchy under direct Manchu command. Hong Taiji then proceeded in 1636 to [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|invade Korea]] again.

This was followed by the creation of the first two Han Banners in 1637 (increasing to eight in 1642). Together these military reforms enabled Hong Taiji to resoundingly defeat Ming forces in a [[Battle of Songjin|series of battles]] from 1640 to 1642 for the territories of [[Songshan]] and [[Jingzhou]]. This final victory resulted in the surrender of many of the Ming Dynasty's most battle-hardened troops, the death of Yuan Chonghuan at the hands of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] (who thought Yuan had betrayed him), and the complete and permanent withdrawal of the remaining Ming forces north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]].

Meanwhile, Hong Taiji set up a rudimentary bureaucratic system based on the Ming model. He established six boards or executive level ministries in 1631 to oversee finance, personnel, rites, military, punishments, and public works. However, these administrative organs had very little role initially, and it was not until the eve of completing the conquest some ten years later that they filled out their government roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Gertraude Roth|title=State Building Before 1644|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=9–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Whereas under Nurhachi all captured Han Chinese were seen as potential [[fifth column]]ists for the Ming and treated as [[slavery in China|chattel]]{{spaced ndash}}including those who eventually held important government posts{{spaced ndash}}Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen &quot;nation&quot; as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China History » The early Qing dynasty » The rise of the Manchu]&lt;/ref&gt;

This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming Dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.

One of the defining events of Hong Taiji's reign was the official adoption of the name &quot;Manchu&quot; for the united Jurchen people in November, 1635. The next year, when he is said to be presented with the [[Imperial Seal of China|imperial seal]] of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] after the defeat of the last [[Khagan]] of the Mongols, Hong Taiji renamed his state from &quot;Great Jin&quot; to &quot;Great Qing&quot; and elevated his position from Khan to [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories.

=== Claiming the Mandate of Heaven ===

Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643 without a designated heir. As the Jurchens had traditionally &quot;elected&quot; their leader through a council of nobles, the Qing state did not have in place a clear succession system until the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]]. The leading contenders for power at this time were Hong Taiji's oldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]] and Hong Taiji's [[Sibling#half|agnate]] half brother [[Dorgon]]. In the ensuing political impasse between the two bitter political rivals, a compromise candidate in the person of Hong Taiji's five-year-old son Fulin, was installed as the [[Shunzhi Emperor]], with Dorgon as regent and ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the Manchu nation.

The Manchus' archenemy, the Ming Dynasty, was fighting for its own survival against a long [[Ming Dynasty#Rebellion.2C invasion.2C collapse|peasant rebellion]] and was unable to capitalise on the Qing court's political uncertainty over the succession dispute and installation of a minor as emperor. The Ming Dynasty's internal crisis came to a head in April 1644, when the capital at [[Beijing]] was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]], a former minor Ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt and established a short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]]. The last Ming ruler, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], committed suicide when the city fell, marking the official end of the dynasty.

After easily taking Beijing, Li Zicheng led a coalition of rebel forces numbering 200,000&lt;ref&gt;The exact figure of Li Zicheng's forces at the battle of [[Shanhai Pass]] is disputed. Some primary sources, such as the official Qing and Ming court histories ({{zh|t=《清世祖實錄》, 《明史》}}), cite 200,000. Modern historians{{Who|date=June 2009}} generally estimate Li Zicheng's army to be no larger than 100,000.&lt;/ref&gt; to confront [[Wu Sangui]], the general commanding the Ming garrison at [[Shanhai Pass]]. Shanhai Pass is a pivotal [[Mountain pass|pass]] of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], located fifty miles northeast of Beijing, and for years its defenses were what kept the Manchus from directly raiding the Ming capital. Wu Sangui, caught between a rebel army twice his size and a foreign enemy he had fought for years, decided to cast his lot with the Manchus with whom he was familiar, and made an alliance with Dorgon to fight the rebels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Some sources suggested that Wu Sangui's actions were influenced by news of mistreatment of his family and his concubine [[Chen Yuanyuan]] at the hands of the rebels when the capital fell. Regardless of the actual reasons for his decision, this awkward and some would say cynical alliance between Wu Sangui and his former sworn enemy was ironically made in the name of avenging the death of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]]. Together, the two former enemies met and defeated Li Zicheng's rebel forces in [[Battle of Shanhai Pass|battle on May 27, 1644]].

After routing Li Zicheng's forces, the Manchus captured [[Beijing]] on June 6, where the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was installed as the [[Chinese sovereign|&quot;Son of Heaven&quot;]] on October 30. The Manchus who had positioned themselves as political heir to the Ming emperor by defeating Li Zicheng, completed the symbolic act of transition by holding a formal funeral for the Chongzhen Emperor. However the process of conquering the rest of China took another seventeen years of battling Ming loyalists, [[pretender]]s and rebels.

It also involved huge loss of life, including the infamous [[Yangzhou massacre]] of 1645, when a ten-day rampage by troops in the city with the permission of [[Dodo (prince)|Prince Dodo]] resulted in an estimated 800,000 deaths. The last Ming pretender, [[Zhu Youlang, Prince of Gui|Prince Gui]], sought refuge with the King of [[Burma]], but was turned over to a Qing expeditionary army commanded by Wu Sangui, who had him brought back to [[Yunnan]] province and executed in early 1662.

[[File:Radpaddelsch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Chinese [[Paddle steamer|paddle-wheel]] driven ship from a Qing Dynasty [[encyclopedia]] published in 1726.]]
The first seven years of the Shunzhi Emperor's reign were dominated by the regent prince Dorgon, who, because of his own political insecurity within the Manchu power structure, followed Hong Taiji's example of centralizing power under his own control in the name of the emperor at the expense of other contending Manchu princes, many of whom eventually were demoted or imprisoned under one pretext or another. Although the period of his regency was relatively short, Dorgon cast a long shadow over the Qing Dynasty.

Firstly the Manchus were able to enter &quot;China proper&quot; only because of Dorgon's timely decision to act on Wu Sangui's appeal for military assistance. After capturing Beijing instead of sacking the city as the rebels had done before them, Dorgon insisted over the protests of other Manchu princes on making it Qing's capital and largely reappointed Ming officials to their posts. Setting the Qing capital in Beijing may seem a straightforward move in hindsight, but it was then an act of innovation because historically no major Chinese dynasty had ever directly taken over its immediate predecessor's capital. Keeping the Ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the country and greatly sped up the Manchu process of conquest. However, not all of Dorgon's policies were equally popular nor easily implemented.

One of Dorgon's most controversial decisions was his July 1645 edict (the &quot;haircutting order&quot;) that forced all adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]], on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman (1985), 646-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan of the order is: &quot;To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tong and Chan (2001), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values. The ''Classic of Filial Piety'' (''Xiaojing'' 孝經) states that &quot;a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged&quot; (身體髮膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷). Under the Ming Dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot.&lt;ref&gt;(Wakeman [1985], 648 n. 183)&lt;/ref&gt;  Before capturing Beijing, the Later Jin government implemented a mandatory shaving of the hair in [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]] in the early 1620s, which led to a rebellion of the Han Chinese of this area in 1622 and 1625, resulting in the death of more than 500,000 people and a stricter separation between Han Chinese and Manchus such as prohibition of intermarriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebrey&quot;&gt;Ebrey (1993). {{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1645 order was so deeply unpopular that it triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in [[Jiangnan]] until at least the late 1640s,&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman (1985), 651-80.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese in this area. One well documented massacre was the triple massacres at Jiading, in which Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who previously served the Ming Dynasty but later surrendered to the Qing,&lt;ref&gt;Faure (2007), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; ordered troops to carry out three separate massacres on the Jiading inhabitants within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly any living person left in this city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebrey&quot; /&gt;

On December 31, 1650, Dorgon suddenly died during a hunting expedition, marking the official start of the Shunzhi Emperor's personal rule. Because the emperor was only 12 years old at that time, most decisions were made on his behalf by his mother, the [[Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang]], who turned out to be a skilled political operator.

Although Dorgon's support had been essential to Shunzhi's ascent, Dorgon had through the years centralised so much power in his hands as to become a direct threat to the throne. So much so that upon his death he was extraordinarily bestowed the posthumous title of Emperor Yi ({{zh|t=義皇帝}}), the only instance in Qing history in which a Manchu &quot;[[Prince#Genealogical Princes.2C by birth or equivalent|prince of the blood]]&quot; ({{zh|t=親王}}) was so honored. Two months into Shunzhi's personal rule, Dorgon was not only stripped of his titles, but his corpse was disinterred and mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;This event was recorded by Italian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Martin Martinius in his account ''Bellum Tartaricum'' with original text in Latin, first published in Rome 1654. First English edition, London: John Crook, 1654.&lt;/ref&gt; to atone for multiple &quot;crimes&quot;, one of which was persecuting to death Shunzhi’s agnate eldest brother, [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]. More importantly, Dorgon's symbolic fall from grace also signalled a political purge of his family and associates at court, thus reverting power back to the person of the emperor. After a promising start, Shunzhi's reign was cut short by his early death in 1661 at the age of twenty-four from [[smallpox]]. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who reigned as the [[Kangxi Emperor]].

=== The Kangxi Emperor's reign and consolidation ===
[[File:Portrait of the Kangxi Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Kangxi Emperor]] (r. 1662–1722)]]
At sixty one years, the reign of [[Kangxi]] was the longest of any [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. But more importantly, apart from its length, Kangxi's reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era called &quot;Kang-Qian Golden Age&quot; ({{zh|c=康乾盛世}}), also known as &quot;High Qing&quot;, during which the Qing Dynasty reached the zenith of its social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of [[Dorgon]]'s dictatorial monopolizing of state power during the period of regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers — [[Sonin]], [[Ebilun]], [[Suksaha]], and [[Oboi]] — were chosen for their long service to the emperor, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most importantly, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However as time passed, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four ministers, was able to achieve political dominance to such an extent as to become a potential threat to the crown. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him to come into ever escalating conflict with the young Kangxi Emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi — a not insignificant victory for the fifteen-year-old emperor, as Oboi was not only a wily old politician but also an experienced military commander.

The Manchus found controlling the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot; a daunting task. The vastness of China's territory meant that there were only enough banner troops to garrison key cities forming the backbone of a defence network that relied heavily on surrendered Ming soldiers. In addition, three surrendered Ming generals were singled out for their contributions to the establishment of the Qing dynasty, ennobled as feudal princes (藩王), and given governorships over vast territories in Southern China. The chief of these was [[Wu Sangui]], who was given the provinces of [[Yunnan]] and [[Guizhou]], while generals [[Shang Kexi]] (尚可喜) and [[Geng Jingzhong]] (耿精忠) were given [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]] provinces respectively.

[[File:Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 041.jpg|left|thumb|Pilgrim flask, [[porcelain]] with underglaze blue and iron-red decoration. Qing Dynasty, Qianlong period in the 18th century.]]
As the years went by, the three feudal lords and their territories inevitably became increasingly autonomous. Finally, in 1673, Shang Kexi petitioned the Kangxi Emperor, stating his desire to retire to his hometown in [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]] province and nominating his son as his successor. The young emperor granted his retirement, but denied the heredity of his fief. In reaction, the two other generals decided to petition for their own retirements to test Kangxi's resolve, thinking that he would not risk offending them. The move backfired as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering all three fiefdoms to be reverted back to the crown.

Faced with the stripping of their powers, Wu Sangui felt he had no choice but to rise up in revolt. He was joined by Geng Zhongming and by Shang Kexi's son Shang Zhixin (尚之信). The ensuing rebellion lasted for eight years. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they managed to extend their control as far north as the [[Yangtze River]]. Ultimately, though, the Qing government was able to put down the rebellion and exert control over all of southern China. The rebellion would be known in Chinese history as the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]].

To consolidate the dynasty, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]], and later the [[Russian Empire]]. He arranged the marriage of his daughter to the Mongol leader [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan]] to avoid a military conflict. Galdan's military campaign against the Qing Empire failed, further strengthening the power of the dynasty. During Kangxi's reign, [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]] were invaded by the Dzungars and asked for help from China. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. [[Taiwan]] was also conquered by Qing forces in 1683 from [[Zheng Keshuang]], grandson of [[Koxinga]]. Koxinga had conquered Taiwan from the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonists to use it as a base against the Qing Dynasty. By the end of the 17th century, China was at its greatest height of power since the [[Ming Dynasty]].

The Kangxi Emperor also handled many [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries that came to China. A series of missionaries, including [[Thomas Pereira|Tomás Pereira]], [[Martino Martini]], [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]], [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] and [[Antoine Thomas]], also held significant positions as mathematicians, astronomers and advisers to the emperor.

=== Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors ===
[[File:Budala5.jpg|thumb|260px|right|The [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]] of [[Chengde]], built in the 18th century during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].]]

The reigns of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] (r. 1723–1735) and his son, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (r. 1735–1796), marked the height of the Qing Dynasty's power. During this period, the Qing Empire ruled over 13 million square kilometres of territory.

After the Kangxi Emperor's death in the winter of 1722, his fourth son, Prince Yong (雍親王), succeeded him as the Yongzheng Emperor. Yongzheng remained a controversial character because of rumours about him usurping the throne, and in the late years of Kangxi's reign, he was involved in great political struggles with his brothers. Yongzheng was a hardworking administrator who ruled with an iron hand. His first big step towards a stronger regime came when he brought the [[Imperial examination|State Examination System]] back to its original standards. In 1724, he cracked down on illegal exchange rates of coins, which was being manipulated by officials to fit their financial needs. Those who were found in violation of new laws on finances were removed from office, or in extreme cases, executed.

[[Image:The Reception.JPG|thumb|left|250px|&quot;The reception of the Diplomatique ([[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Macartney]]) and his suite, at the Court of Pekin&quot;. Drawn and engraved by [[James Gillray]], published in September 1792.]]
Yongzheng showed a great amount of trust in [[Han Chinese]] officials, and appointed many of his proteges to prestigious positions. [[Nian Gengyao]] was appointed to lead a military campaign in place of his brother [[Yunti|Yinti]] in [[Qinghai]].

More territory was incorporated in the northwest. Starting in 1727, Qing [[Amban|imperial residents]] were stationed in [[Lhasa]], and commanded over Qing garrisons in [[Tibet]]. A toughened stance was directed toward corrupt officials, and Yongzheng led the creation of a [[Grand Council (Qing Dynasty)|Grand Council]], which grew to become the de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty.

The Yongzheng Emperor died in 1735. This was followed by the succession of his son, Prince Bao (寶親王), as the Qianlong Emperor. Qianlong was known as an able general. Succeeding the throne at the age of 24, Qianlong personally led the military in campaigns near [[Xinjiang]] and [[Mongolia]]. Revolts and uprisings in [[Sichuan]] and parts of southern China were successfully put down, and the control over Tibet was strengthened.

The Qianlong Emperor also launched several ambitious cultural projects, such as the compilation of ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', or ''Complete Library in Four Branches of Literature''. With a total of over 3,400 books, 79,000 chapters, and 36,304 volumes, ''Siku Quanshu'' is the largest collection of books in Chinese history as well as the largest series of books ever edited by the feudal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Mastering Chinese Language and Culture: History of China (Part 2), p87&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Qianlong had used [[Literary Inquisition]] to silence opposition. The accusation of individuals began with the emperor's own interpretation of the true meaning of the corresponding words. If the emperor decided these were derogatory or cynical towards the dynasty, persecution would begin. Literary inquisition began with isolated cases in the times of Shunzhi and Kangxi, but had become a pattern during Qianlong's reign, during which there were 53 cases of literary persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://big5.china.com.cn/city/txt/2007-03/08/content_7927803.htm|title=In Chinese:康乾盛世&quot;的文化專制與文字獄|publisher=www.big5.china.com|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late years of Qianlong's reign, the Qing government saw a return of rampant corruption. [[Heshen]] was arguably one of the most corrupt officials in the entire history of the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Schoppa, R. Keith. ''Revolution and its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History''. Pearson Hall, 2010, pgs. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Heshen was eventually forced into committing suicide by Qianlong's son, the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] (r. 1796–1820).

In 1796 open rebellion by the [[White Lotus|White Lotus Society]] against the Qing government broke out. The [[White Lotus Rebellion]] continued for eight years, until 1804, and marked a turning point in the history of the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica, p357&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebellion, unrest and external pressure ===
[[File:China Qing Dynasty Flag 1862.png|thumb|left|[[Flag of the Qing Dynasty|Flag of Qing Dynasty]], 1862–1890]]
The Qing struggled with the concept of international and state to state relations. Prior to the 19th-century, the [[Late Imperial China|Chinese empire]] was generally the hegemonic power in East Asia. However, the 18th century saw the European empires gradually expand across the world, as European states developed stronger economies built on maritime trade. European colonies had been established in nearby [[India]] and on the islands that are now part of [[Indonesia]], whilst the [[Russian Empire]] advanced into the areas north of China. The Qing response was successful for a time in establishing the [[Canton System]], which restricted and controlled maritime trade and the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689), which stabilized relations with Czarist Russia.

In 1793, the British East India Company, with the support of the British government sent a delegation to China under Lord George Macartney in order to change the nature of trade between the two countries in a direction which they believed was more befitting for a country of Britain's status. Up to this point, all Western powers were forced to trade only at one port (at Canton) and traded very much on the Chinese system. This was formed around a fundamental disdain for both Western merchants and their goods. The government viewed trade as unimportant. For the British, however, maritime trade was the key to sustaining their economy.

The Qianlong Emperor reported to the British ambassador [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] that China had no use for European manufactured products.&lt;ref&gt;Têng Ssu-yü and John King Fairbank, eds., ''China's Response to the West: A Documentary Survey, 1839–1923'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, leading Chinese merchants only accepted bar silver as payment for their goods. The demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China. By the late 1830s, the governments of Great Britain and France were deeply concerned about their stockpiles of precious metals and sought alternate trading schemes with China — the foremost of which was meeting the growing Chinese demand for opium. When the Qing regime tried to ban the opium trade in 1838, Great Britain declared war on China in the following year.

[[File:China imperialism cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In this political cartoon, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] are dividing China]]
The [[First Opium War]] revealed the outdated state of the Chinese military. The Qing navy, composed entirely of wooden sailing [[Junk (ship)|junks]], was severely outclassed by the modern tactics and firepower of the British [[Royal Navy]]. British soldiers, using advanced muskets and artillery, easily outmaneuvered and outgunned Qing forces in ground battles. The Qing surrender in 1842 marked a decisive, humiliating blow to China. The [[Treaty of Nanking|Treaty of Nanjing]], which demanded [[war reparations|reparation]] payments, allowed unrestricted European access to Chinese ports, and ceded [[Hong Kong Island]] to Great Britain. It revealed many inadequacies in the Qing government and provoked widespread rebellions against the already hugely unpopular regime.

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] in the mid-19th century was the first major instance of [[Anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu sentiment]] threatening the stability of the dynasty. [[Hong Xiuquan]], a failed [[Imperial examination|civil service]] candidate, led the Taiping Rebellion, amid widespread social unrest and worsening famine. In 1851 Hong Xiuquan and others launched an uprising in [[Guizhou]] province, established the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] with Hong himself as king, claiming he often had visions of God and that he was the brother of Jesus Christ. Slavery, concubinage, arranged marriage, opium smoking, footbinding, judicial torture, and the worship of idols were all banned. However, success and subsequent authority and power led to internal feuds, defections and corruption. In addition, British and French troops, equipped with modern weapons, had come to the assistance of the Qing imperial army. It was not until 1864 that Qing armies under [[Zeng Guofan]] succeeded in crushing the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/modern2.html|title=The Taiping Rebellion, 1851-64|publisher=University of Maryland web site|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion not only posed the most serious threat towards Qing rulers; it was also &quot;the costliest (human life) civil war in history and second bloodiest war of any kind, being only exceeded in casualties by [[World War II]]. Between 20 and 30 million people died during its fourteen-year course from 1850 to 1864.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/manchu|title=Manchus|publisher=Answer.com|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of this rebellion, there were also revolts by the [[Hui people|Muslim]]s and [[Miao people]] of China against the Qing Dynasty, most notably in the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)]] in the northwest and the [[Panthay Rebellion]] (1856–1873) in [[Yunnan]].

[[File:Regaining the Provincial Capital of Ruizhou.jpg|thumb|280px|A scene of the Taiping Rebellion, 1850-1864]]

The Western powers, largely unsatisfied with the Treaty of Nanjing, gave grudging support to the Qing government during the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping]] and [[Nien Rebellion]]s. China's income fell sharply during the wars as vast areas of farmland were destroyed, millions of lives lost, and countless armies raised and equipped to fight the rebels. In 1854, Great Britain tried to re-negotiate the Treaty of Nanjing, inserting clauses allowing British commercial access to Chinese rivers and the creation of a permanent British embassy at Beijing. This last clause outraged the Qing regime, who refused to sign, provoking another war with Britain. The [[Second Opium War]] ended in another crushing Chinese defeat, whilst the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] contained clauses deeply insulting to the Chinese, such as a demand that all official Chinese documents be written in English and a proviso granting British warships unlimited access to all navigable Chinese rivers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Yet the dynasty rallied. Chinese generals and officials such as [[Zuo Zongtang]] had led the suppression of rebellions and stood behind the Manchus in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] Zeng Guofan, in alliance with [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] sponsored the rise of younger officials such as [[Li Hongzhang]] who put the dynasty back on its feet financially and instituted the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Wright ''The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism: The T'ung-chih Restoration'' (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt; The reformers then proceeded with institutional reforms, including the formation of modernized armies, such as the [[Beiyang Army]]. However, the fleets of &quot;Beiyang&quot; were annihilated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), which produced calls for greater and more extensive reform.

=== Rule of Empress Dowager Cixi ===
[[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Political map of Asia in 1890, showing late-Qing China (''centre, in light brown'').]]
The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (also spelled as T'su-hsi), [[Concubinage|concubine]] to the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] (r. 1850–1861) came to power in 1861 during the Xinyou Coup, when, with the help of [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]], she ousted eight regents (led by [[Sushun]]) whom the Xianfeng Emperor had appointed on his deathbed to rule for the child emperor [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]], Cixi's son. For 7 years in the Tongzhi era (1862–1874) and during the reign of her nephew, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875–1908), Cixi was the ''de facto'' ruler of China and the Qing Empire. She was known for &quot;ruling from behind the curtain&quot; ({{zh|t=垂簾聽政|s=垂帘听政|p=chuílián tīngzhèng}}).

From 1889 to 1898, the Empress Dowager lived in the [[Summer Palace]] in semi-retirement. After losing to Japan in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Guangxu Emperor initiated the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], in which new laws were put in place and some old rules were abolished. Newer, more progressive-minded thinkers like [[Kang Youwei]] were trusted and recognized conservative-minded people like [[Li Hongzhang]] were removed from high positions. The empress dowager then returned to the imperial court to call off the emperor's reform, and at the same time put him under house arrest and ordered eunuchs faithful to her to keep watch. Cixi continued to centralise her own power base. On her sixtieth birthday, she spent over 30 million taels of silver for the decorations &amp; events, funds that were originally planned to improve the weaponry of the [[Beiyang Fleet]].

In 1900, during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], following the murder of the German ambassador by the Righteous Harmony Society, the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] entered China as a united military force for the second time. Cixi reacted by declaring war on all eight nations, only to lose control of [[Beijing]] within a short period of time. Along with the Guangxu Emperor, she fled to [[Xi'an]]. As a military compensation, the alliance listed scores of demands on the Qing government, including an initial hit list, which had Cixi's name as the first on it. Li Hongzhang was sent to negotiate and the alliance backed down from several of the demands.

The Boxer Rebellion's initial objectives were to overthrow the Qing imperial court and expel all &quot;foreign devils&quot; from China. Empress Dowager Cixi had decided to remotely control and, at the same time, intensify the Boxer movement through her ministers. Not long after, the Boxers' banner had a new slogan: &quot;Support Qing; destroy the foreigners!&quot;. In early 1900 an imperial edict released by the empress dowager stated that &quot;secret societies were part of Chinese culture and were not criminal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historikorders.com/chinaboxer.htm &lt;!-- The new emperor, Kuang Hsu, was skinny, sickly, and terrified of the Empress Dowager --&gt;|title=BOXER REBELLION // CHINA 1900|publisher=HISTORIK ORDERS, LTD WEBSITE|accessdate=2008-10-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Eight-Nation Alliance's armies marched into Beijing, Cixi fled the capital only to accept peace terms by paying the foreign powers huge amounts of silver. Before her death, on November 15, 1908, she allegedly ordered her trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/8/11/3/n2317769.htm|title=科学报告：光绪皇帝死于砒霜中毒 Scientistific report:Guangxu died of arsenic poisoning|publisher=epochtimes.com|accessdate=2008-11-01}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fall of the dynasty ===
[[File:Yuan Shi-Kai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yuan Shikai]] was an adept politician and general.]]
By the early 20th century, mass civil disorder had begun and continuously grown. To overcome such problems, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] issued an imperial edict in 1901 calling for reform proposals from the governors-general and governors and initiated the era of the dynasty's &quot;New Policy&quot;, also known as the &quot;Late Qing Reform&quot;. The edict paved the way for the most far-reaching reforms in terms of their social consequences, including the creation of a national education system and the abolition of the [[imperial examination]]s in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Kaske, &quot;The politics of language in Chinese education, 1895–1919&quot;, p235&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cixi and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] both died in 1908, leaving a relatively powerless and unstable central authority. [[Puyi]], the oldest son of [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]], was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General [[Yuan Shikai]] from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet, in which there were two vice-premiers. Nevertheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as &quot;The Royal Cabinet&quot; because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or [[Aisin Gioro]] relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Chien-nung Li, Jiannong Li, Ssŭ-yü Têng, &quot;The political history of China, 1840–1928&quot;, p234&lt;/ref&gt; This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like [[Zhang Zhidong]].

The [[Wuchang Uprising]] succeeded on October 10, 1911, which led to the creation of the new central government, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], in [[Nanjing]] with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as its provisional head. Many provinces began &quot;separating&quot; from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought an unwilling Yuan Shikai back to military power, taking control of his [[Beiyang Army]], with the initial goal of crushing the revolutionaries. After taking the position of [[Chancellor (China)|Prime Minister]] and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency. This removal later proceeded with directions from [[Empress Dowager Longyu]].

With Zaifeng gone, Yuan Shikai and his Beiyang commanders effectively dominated Qing politics. He reasoned that going to war would be unreasonable and costly, especially when noting that the Qing government had a goal for constitutional monarchy. Similarly, Sun Yat-sen's government wanted a republican constitutional reform, both aiming for the benefit of China's economy and populace. With permission from Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai began negotiating with Sun Yat-sen, who decided that his goal had been achieved in forming a republic, and that therefore he could allow Yuan to step into the position of [[List of Presidents of the Republic of China|President of the Republic of China]].

On 12 February 1912, after rounds of negotiations, Longyu issued an imperial edict bringing about the abdication of the child emperor Puyi. This brought an end to over 2,000 years of imperial China and began an extended period of instability of [[Warlord era|warlord factionalism]]. The unorganized political and economic systems combined with a widespread criticism of Chinese culture led to questioning and doubt about the future. In the 1930s, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Manchuria]] and founded [[Manchukuo]] in 1934, with Puyi, as the nominal regent and emperor. After the invasion by the [[Soviet Union]], Manchukuo collapsed in 1945.

[[File:Qing Dynasty 1820.png|thumb|300px|Qing Dynasty in 1820, with provinces in yellow, military governorates and protectorates in light yellow, tributary states in orange.]]
Qing China reached its largest extent during the 18th century, when it ruled [[China proper]] as well as [[Manchuria]] ([[Northeast China]]), [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]], at approximately 13 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size. There were originally 18 provinces, all of which in China proper, but later this number was increased to 22, with Manchuria and Xinjiang being divided or turned into provinces. [[Taiwan]], originally part of [[Fujian]] province, became a province of its own in the 19th century, but was ceded to the [[Empire of Japan]] following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] by the end of the century. In addition, many surrounding countries, such as [[Korea]] ([[Joseon Dynasty]]), [[Vietnam]] and [[Nepal]], were [[tributary state]]s of China during much of this period.

=== Territory administrations ===
[[Image:China Proper.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Eighteen provinces (China proper) 1875]]
The original provinces of Qing China was based on the fifteen administrative units set up by the Ming Dynasty, though some minor reforms took place to become the eighteen provinces (for example, [[Huguang]] was split into Hubei and Hunan provinces). Adopted the model used by the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the Qing provincial bureaucracy also contained three commissions: one civil, one military, and one for surveillance. Each [[Province (China)|province]] was governed by a civil official called ''[[xunfu]]'' ({{linktext|巡撫}}) and a military official called ''[[tidu]]'' ({{linktext|提督}}). Below the level of the province were [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]] ({{linktext|府}}, ''fu'') operating under a prefect ({{linktext|知府}}, ''zhīfǔ''), followed by [[Zhou (country subdivision)|subprefectures]] under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]], overseen by a [[magistrate]]. These areas under the administration of the eighteen provinces are also known as &quot;China proper&quot;. The position of [[Viceroy (China)|viceroy]] or governor-general was the highest rank in the provincial administration. There were eight regional viceroys in China proper, each usually took charge of two or three provinces. The [[Viceroy of Zhili]], who was responsible for the area surrounding the capital [[Beijing]], is usually considered as the most honorable and powerful viceroy among the eight.

By the mid-18th century, the Qing had successfully put outer regions such as [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]] under its control. [[Amban|Imperial commissioners]] and garrisons were sent to Mongolia and Tibet to oversee their affairs. These territories were also under supervision of a central government institution called [[Lifan Yuan]]. [[Qinghai]] was also put under direct control of the Qing court. Xinjiang, also known as Chinese Turkestan, was subdivided into the regions north and south of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, also known today as [[Dzungaria]] and [[Tarim Basin]] respectively, but the post of Ili General was established in 1762 to exercise unified military and administrative jurisdiction over both regions. Likewise, [[Manchuria]] was also governed by military generals until its division into provinces, though some areas of Xinjiang and Manchuria were lost to the [[Russian Empire]] in the mid-19th century. Manchuria was originally separated from China proper by the Inner [[Willow Palisade]], a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han Chinese into Manchuria, as the area was off-limits to the Han Chinese until the Qing government started colonizing the area with them later on in the dynasty's rule, especially since the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (2000), 603-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Qing china.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Qing China in 1892]]
With respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and protector of [[Hui people|Muslim]]s. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During [[The Great Game]] era, taking advantage of the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] in northwest China, [[Yaqub Beg]] invaded Xinjiang from [[Central Asia]] with support from the Russian Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of [[Kashgar]]ia. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The [[Kumul Khanate]], which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the [[Xinhai Revolution]] up until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=maqsud+shah&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PUmpTKapGYK8lQeltoSODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=maqsud%20shah&amp;f=false|title=Eurasian crossroads: a history of Xinjiang|author=James A.

The Qing court responded by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B01E6DF1531E733A2575AC1A9679C946797D6CF The New York Times, Jan 19, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention signed between Britain and China. The British agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet, while China engaged not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty1906&quot;&gt;[[s:Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet|Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, similar to Xinjiang which was converted into a province earlier, the Qing government also turned Manchuria into three provinces in the early 20th century, officially known as the &quot;[[Northeast China|Three Northeast Provinces]]&quot;, and established the post of [[Viceroy of Three Northeast Provinces]] to oversee these provinces, making the total number of regional viceroys to nine.

=== Central government agencies ===
The Qing Dynasty inherited many important institutions from the preceding [[Ming Dynasty]]. The formal structure of the Qing government centered on the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] as the absolute ruler, who presided over six Boards (Ministries) ({{zh|c=六部|p=lìubù}}), each headed by two presidents ({{zh|t=尚書|s=尚书|p=shàngshū}}; [[Manchu language|Ma]]: [[File:aliha amban.svg|40px]] ''Aliha amban'') and assisted by four vice presidents ({{zh|p=shìláng|c=侍郎}}; Ma: [[File:ashan i amban.png|40px]] ''Ashan i amban''). In contrast to the Ming system, however, Qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examination|state examinations]]. The Grand Secretariat ({{zh|p=nèigé|t=內閣|s=内阁}}; Ma: [[File:dorgi yamun.png|40px]] ''Dorgi yamun''), which had been an important policy-making body under the Ming Dynasty, lost its importance during the Qing Dynasty and evolved into an imperial chancery. The institutions which had been inherited from the Ming Dynasty formed the core of the Qing &quot;outer court,&quot; which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the [[Forbidden City]].

In order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire, the Qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the &quot;Inner Court,&quot; which was dominated by the imperial family and Manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the Forbidden City. The core institution of the inner court was the [[Grand Council (Qing Dynasty)|Grand Council]] ({{zh|p=jūnjī chù|t=軍機處|s=军机处}}). It emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] as a body charged with handling Qing military campaigns against the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] [[Mongols]], but it soon took over other military and administrative duties and served to centralize authority under the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett (1991). {{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Councillors ({{zh|p=jūnjī dàchén|t=軍機大臣|s=军机大臣}}) served as a sort of [[privy council]] to the emperor.

The Six Ministries and their respective areas of responsibilities were as follows:

[[File:Qing Dynasty-2000 wen-1859.jpg|200px|thumb|left|2000-[[Chinese cash (currency)|cash]] banknote from 1859]]
*Board of Civil Appointments ({{zh|p=lìbù|c=吏部}}; Ma: [[File:hafan i jurgan.png|40px]] ''Hafan i jurgan'')
:The personnel administration of all civil officials - including evaluation, promotion, and dismissal. It was also in charge of the &quot;honours list&quot;.

*Board of Finance ({{zh|p=hùbù|c=户部}}; Ma: [[File:boigon i jurgan.png|40px]] ''Boigon i jurgan'')
:The literal translation of the Chinese word ''hu'' (户) is &quot;household&quot;. For much of the Qing Dynasty's history, the government's main source of revenue came from taxation on landownership supplemented by official monopolies on essential household items such as salt and tea. Thus, in the predominantly agrarian Qing Dynasty, the &quot;household&quot; was the basis of imperial finance. The department was charged with revenue collection and the financial management of the government.

*Board of Rites ({{zh|p=lǐbù|t=禮部|s=礼部}}; Ma: [[File:dorolon i jurgan.png|40px]] ''Dorolon i jurgan'')
:This board was responsible for all matters concerning court protocol. It organized the periodic worship of ancestors and various gods by the emperor, managed relations with [[List of tributaries of Imperial China#Qing Dynasty|tributary nations]], and oversaw the nationwide [[Imperial examination|civil examination system]].

*Board of War ({{zh|p=bīngbù|c=兵部}}; Ma: [[File:coohai jurgan.png|40px]] ''Coohai jurgan'')
:Unlike its Ming predecessor, which had full control over all military matters, the Qing Board of War had very limited powers. First, the [[Eight Banners]] were under the direct control of the emperor and hereditary Manchu and Mongol princes, leaving the ministry only with authority over the [[Green Standard Army]]. Furthermore, the ministry's functions were purely administrative campaigns and troop movements were monitored and directed by the emperor, first through the Manchu ruling council, and later through the Grand Council.

*Board of Punishments ({{zh|p=xíngbù|c=刑部}}; Ma: [[File:beidere jurgan.png|40px]] ''Beidere jurgan'')
:The Board of Punishments handled all legal matters, including the supervision of various law courts and prisons. The [[Great Qing Legal Code|Qing legal framework]] was relatively weak compared to modern day legal systems, as there was no separation of executive and legislative branches of government. The legal system could be inconsistent, and, at times, arbitrary, because the emperor ruled by decree and had final say on all judicial outcomes. Emperors could (and did) overturn judgements of lower courts from time to time. Fairness of treatment was also an issue under the apartheid system practised by the Manchu government over the Han Chinese majority. To counter these inadequacies and keep the population in line, the Qing government maintained a very harsh penal code towards the Han populace, but it was no more severe than previous Chinese dynasties.

[[File:Yantai (Chefoo), Qing Dynasty postage stamp.gif|thumb|A postage stamp from [[Yantai]] (Chefoo) in the Qing Dynasty]]

*Board of Works ({{zh|p=gōngbù|c=工部}}; Ma: [[File:weilere jurgan.png|40px]] ''Weilere jurgan'')
:The Board of Works handled all governmental building projects, including palaces, temples and the repairs of waterways and flood canals. It was also in charge of minting coinage.

From the early Qing Dynasty, the central government was characterized by a system of dual appointments by which each position in the central government had a Manchu and a Han Chinese assigned to it. The Han Chinese appointee was required to do the substantive work and the Manchu to ensure Han loyalty to Qing rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/imperial3.html#regain|title=The Rise of the Manchus|publisher=University of Maryland web site|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between Han Chinese and Manchus extended to their court costumes. During the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s reign, for example, members of his family were distinguished by garments with a small circular emblem on the back, whereas Han officials wore clothing with a square emblem.

In addition to the six boards, there was a [[Lifan Yuan]] unique to the Qing government. This institution was established to supervise the administration of Tibet and the Mongol lands. As the empire expanded, it took over administrative responsibility of all minority ethnic groups living in and around the empire, including early contacts with Russia — then seen as a tribute nation. The office had the status of a full ministry and was headed by officials of equal rank. However, appointees were at first restricted only to candidates of Manchu and Mongol ethnicity, until later open to Han Chinese as well.

Even though the Board of Rites and Lifan Yuan performed some duties of a foreign office, they fell short of developing into a professional foreign service. It was not until 1861 — a year after losing the [[Second Opium War]] to the Anglo-French coalition — that the Qing government bowed to foreign pressure and created a proper foreign affairs office known as the '''[[Zongli Yamen]]'''. The office was originally intended to be temporary and was staffed by officials seconded from the Grand Council. However, as dealings with foreigners became increasingly complicated and frequent, the office grew in size and importance, aided by revenue from customs duties which came under its direct jurisdiction.

There was also another government institution called [[Imperial Household Department]] which was unique to the Qing Dynasty. It was established before the fall of the Ming Dynasty, but it became mature only after 1661, following the death of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] and the accession of his son, the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawski (1998), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The department's primary purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the imperial family and the activities of the [[Forbidden City#Inner Court|inner palace]] (in which tasks it largely replaced [[Eunuch#China|eunuch]]s), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with [[History of Tibet#Khoshut, Zunghar Khanate, and Manchu|Tibet]] and [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Mongolia]], engaged in trading activities (jade, [[ginseng]], salt, furs, etc.), managed textile factories in the [[Jiangnan]] region, and even published books.&lt;ref&gt;Rawski (1998), 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt; The department was manned by ''[[Booi Aha|booi]]'' ({{zh|p=bāoyī|c=包衣}}), or &quot;bondservants,&quot; from the Upper Three [[Eight Banners|Banners]].&lt;ref&gt;Torbert (1977), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, it managed the activities of at least 56 subagencies.&lt;ref&gt;Rawski (1998), 179; Torbert (1977), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===

==== Beginnings and early development ====
[[File:The Qianlong Emperor’s Southern Inspection Tour.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Twelve: Return to the Palace (detail), 1764—1770, by Xu Yang]]
The development of the Qing military system can be divided into two broad periods separated by the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1864). The early Qing military was rooted in the [[Eight Banners]] first developed by [[Nurhachi]] as a way to organize [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] society beyond petty clan affiliations. There are eight banners in all, differentiated by colours. The banners in their order of precedence were as follows: yellow, bordered yellow (i.e. yellow banner with red border), white, red, bordered white, bordered red, blue, and bordered blue. The yellow, bordered yellow, and white banners were collectively known as the &quot;Upper Three Banners&quot; ({{zh|p=shàng sān qí|c=上三旗}}) and were under the direct command of the emperor. Only Manchus belonging to the Upper Three Banners, and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of martial exams were qualified to serve as the emperor's personal bodyguards. The remaining Banners were known as &quot;The Lower Five Banners&quot; ({{zh|p=xià wǔ qí|c=下五旗}}) and were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi's immediate family, known informally as the &quot;Iron Cap Princes&quot; ({{zh|p=tiě màozǐ wáng|t=鐵帽子王|s=铁帽子王}}). Together they formed the ruling council of the Manchu nation as well as high command of the army.

As Qing power expanded north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the last years of the [[Ming Dynasty]], the Banner system was expanded by Nurhachi's son and successor [[Hong Taiji]] to include mirrored Mongol and Han Banners. After capturing [[Beijing]] in 1644 and as the Manchu rapidly gained control of large tracts of former Ming territory, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by the [[Green Standard Army]], which eventually outnumbered Banner troops three to one. The Green Standard Army so-named after the colour of their battle standards was made up of those Ming troops who had surrendered to the Qing. They maintained their Ming era organization and were led by a mix of Banner and Green Standard officers. The Banners and Green Standard troops were standing armies, paid for by central government. In addition, regional governors from provincial down to village level maintained their own irregular local militias for police duties and disaster relief. These militias were usually granted small annual stipends from regional coffers for part-time service obligations. They received very limited military drills if at all and were not considered combat troops.

==== Peace and stagnation ====
[[File:FFM-QingRotlackDose.JPG|thumb|right|A red [[lacquer]] box from the Qing Dynasty.]]
[[Eight Banners|Banner]] Armies were broadly divided along ethnic lines, namely Manchu and Mongol. Although it must be pointed out that the ethnic composition of Manchu Banners was far from homogeneous as they included non-Manchu bondservants registered under the household of their Manchu masters. As the war with [[Ming Dynasty]] progressed and the [[Han Chinese]] population under Manchu rule increased, [[Hong Taiji]] created a separate branch of Han Banners to draw on this new source of manpower. However these Han bannermen were never regarded by the government as equal to the other two branches due to their relatively late addition to the Manchu cause as well as their Han Chinese ancestry. The nature of their service—mainly as infantry, artillery and sappers, was also alien to the Manchu nomadic traditions of fighting as cavalry. Furthermore, after the conquest the military roles played by Han bannermen were quickly subsumed by the Green Standard Army. The Han Banners ceased to exist altogether after the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s banner registration reforms aimed at cutting down imperial expenditures.

The socio-military origins of the Banner system meant that population within each branch and their sub-divisions were hereditary and rigid. Only under special circumstances sanctioned by imperial edict were social movements between banners permitted. In contrast, the Green Standard Army was originally intended to be a professional force.

After defeating the remnants of the Ming forces, the Manchu Banner Army of approximately 200,000 strong at the time was evenly divided; half was designated the Forbidden Eight Banner Army ({{zh|c=禁旅八旗|p=jìnlǚ bāqí}}) and was stationed in Beijing. It served both as the capital's garrison and Qing government's main strike force. The remainder of the Banner troops was distributed to guard key cities in China. These were known as the Territorial Eight Banner Army ({{zh|t=駐防八旗|s=驻防八旗|p=zhùfáng bāqí}}). The Manchu court keenly aware its own minority status reinforced a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Mongols from Han Chinese for fear of being sinicized by the latter. This policy applied directly to the Banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities they were stationed in. In cities where there were limitation of space such as in Qingzhou (青州), a new fortified town would be purposely erected to house the Banner garrison and their families. Beijing being the imperial seat, the regent [[Dorgon]] had the entire Chinese population forcibly relocated to the southern suburbs which became known as the &quot;Outer Citadel&quot; ({{zh|c=外城|p=wàichéng}}). The northern walled city called &quot;Inner Citadel&quot; ({{zh|c=內城|p=nèichéng}}) was portioned out to the remaining Manchu Eight Banners, each responsibled for guarding a section of the Inner Citadel surrounding the [[Forbidden City]] palace complex ({{zh|t=紫禁城|p=zǐjìnchéng}}; [[Manchu language|Ma]]: [[File:Dabkūri1.png|40px]] ''Dabkūri dorgi hoton'').

The policy of posting Banner troops as territorial garrison was not to protect but to inspire awe in the subjugated populace at the expense of their expertise as cavalry. As a result, after a century of peace and lack of field training the Manchu Banner troops had deteriorated greatly in their combat worthiness. Secondly, before the conquest the Manchu banner was a &quot;citizen&quot; army, and its members were Manchu farmers and herders obligated to provide military service to the state at times of war. The Qing government's decision to turn the banner troops into a professional force whose every welfare and need was met by state coffers brought wealth, and with it corruption, to the rank and file of the Manchu Banners and hastened its decline as a fighting force. This was mirrored by a similar decline in the Green Standard Army. During peace time, soldiering became merely a source of supplementary income. Soldiers and commanders alike neglected training in pursuit of their own economic gains. Corruption was rampant as regional unit commanders submitted pay and supply requisitions based on exaggerated head counts to the quartermaster department and pocketed the difference. When the [[Taiping Rebellion]] broke out in 1850s, the Qing court found out belatedly that the Banner and Green Standards troops could neither put down internal rebellions nor keep foreign invaders at bay.

==== Transition and modernization ====
[[File:Zeng Guofan.png|150px|thumb|right|General [[Zeng Guofan]]]] Early during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], Qing forces suffered a series of disastrous defeats culminating in the loss of the regional capital city of [[Nanjing]] in 1853. The rebels massacred the entire Manchu garrison and their families in the city and made it their capital. Shortly thereafter a [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of [[Tianjin]] in what was considered imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese mandarin, [[Zeng Guofan]], to organize regional ({{zh|p=tuányǒng|t=團勇|s=团勇}}) and village ({{zh|p=xiāngyǒng|t=鄉勇|s=乡勇}}) [[militia]]s into a standing army called [[tuanlian]] to contain the rebellion. Zeng Guofan's strategy was to rely on local gentries to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the [[Xiang Army]], named after the [[Hunan]] region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders — mostly members of the Chinese gentry — could muster. The Xiang Army and its successor, the [[Huai Army]] (淮軍), created by Zeng Guofan's colleague and student [[Li Hongzhang]], were collectively called the &quot;Yongying&quot; ({{zh|t=勇營|s=勇营|p=Yǒngyíng|l=Brave Camp}}).

Prior to forming and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng Guofan had no military experience. Being a classically educated Mandarin his blueprint for the Xiang Army was taken from a historical source — the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]] who, because of the weakness of regular Ming troops, had decided to form his own &quot;private&quot; army to repel raiding [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] in the mid-16th century. Qi Jiguang's doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised. This initially gave the troops an excellent ''[[esprit de corps]]''. Qi Jiguang's army was an ad hoc solution to the specific problem of combating pirates, as was Zeng Guofan's original intention for the Xiang Army, which was raise to eradicate the Taiping rebels. However, circumstances led to the Yongying system becoming a permanent institution within the Qing military, which in the long run created problems of its own for the beleaguered central government.
[[File:Great Rear Attack by Our Second Army at Weihaiwei.jpg|thumb|left|In 1894–1895, fighting over influence in Korea, Japanese troops defeated Qing forces.]]
Firstly, the Yongying system signalled the end of Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as parasites depleting resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing government's de facto first-line troops. Secondly the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders. This devolution of power weakened the central government's grip on the whole country, a weakness further aggravated by foreign powers vying to carve up autonomous colonial territories in different parts of the Qing Empire in the later half of the 19th century. Despite these serious negative effects the measure was deemed necessary as tax revenue from provinces occupied and threatened by rebels had ceased to reach the cash-strapped central government. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and cronyism amongst its commanders whom as they ascended the bureaucratic ranks laid the seeds to Qing's eventual demise and the outbreak of regional warlordism in China during the first half of the 20th century.

[[File:Beiyang Army.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Beiyang Army]] in training]] By the late 19th century, China was fast descending into a semi-colonial state. Even the most conservative elements within the Qing court could no longer ignore China's military weakness in contrast to the foreign &quot;barbarians&quot; literally beating down its gates. In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], the capital Beijing was captured and the Summer Palace sacked by a relatively small Anglo-French coalition force numbering 25,000. Although the Chinese invented gunpowder, and firearms had been in continual use in Chinese warfare since as far back as the [[Song Dynasty]], the advent of modern weaponry resulting from the European [[Industrial Revolution]] had rendered China's traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete. The government attempts to modernize during the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] were in the view of most historians with hindsight piecemeal and yielded little lasting results. Various reasons for the apparent failure of late-Qing modernization attempts have been advanced including the lack of funds, lack of political will, and unwillingness to depart from tradition. These reasons remain disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman (1985). {{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Naval battle.ogg|thumb|left|Footage of a naval battle during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894).]]

Losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–1895 was a watershed for the Qing government. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], a country long regarded by the Chinese as little more than an upstart nation of pirates, had convincingly beaten its larger neighbour and in the process annihilated the Qing government's pride and joy — its modernized [[Beiyang Fleet]] then deemed to be the strongest naval force in Asia. In doing so, Japan became the first Asian country to join the previously exclusively western ranks of colonial powers. The defeat was a rude awakening to the Qing court especially when set in the context that it occurred a mere three decades after the [[Meiji Restoration]] set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements. Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took some concrete steps to reform military institutions and to re-train selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry. These units were collectively called the [[New Army]]. The most successful of these was the [[Beiyang Army]] under the overall supervision and control of a former Huai Army commander, General [[Yuan Shikai]], who exploited his position to eventually become [[President of the Republic of China]], dictator and finally abortive emperor of China.

==Society==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
The most significant fact of early and mid-Qing social history is population growth. The population doubled during the 18th century. People in this period were also remarkably on the move. There is evidence suggesting that the empire's rapidly expanding population was geographically mobile on a scale which, in term of its volume and its protracted and routinized nature, was unprecedented in Chinese history. Indeed, the Qing government did far more to encourage mobility than to discourage it. Migration took several different forms, though might be divided in two varieties: permanent migration for resettlement, and relocation conceived by the party (in theory at least) as a temporary sojourn. Parties to the latter would include the empire's increasingly large and mobile manual workforce, as well as its densely overlapping internal [[diaspora]] of local-origin-based merchant groups. It would also included the patterned movement of Qing subjects overseas, largely to [[Southeastern Asia]], in search of trade and other economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, vol 9, pg 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statute, Qing society was divided into relatively closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively miniscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding [[Scholar-official|literati]], there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, vol 9, pg 485&lt;/ref&gt; They were divided into two categories: one of them, the good &quot;commoner&quot; people, the other &quot;mean&quot; people. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as ''liangmin'', a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to ''jianmin'' meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional [[four occupations|four occupational groups]] of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were &quot;good&quot;, or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), and those low-level employees of government officials were the &quot;mean people&quot;. Mean people were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, forbidden to take the [[Imperial Examination|imperial examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |coauthors=Susan Naquin, Evelyn Sakakida Rawski |title=Chinese Society in the Eighteenth Century |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA117 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-10-31 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1989 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-300-04602-2 |page=117 |pages= |at= |chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
{{See also|Economic history of China until 1912}}
By the end of the 17th century, the Chinese economy had recovered from the devastation caused by the wars in which the [[Ming Dynasty]] were overthrown, and the resulting breakdown of order.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), pp. 564, 566.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century, markets continued to expand as in the late Ming period, but with more trade between regions, a greater dependence on overseas markets and a greatly increased population.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-opening of the southeast coast, which had been closed in the late 17th century, foreign trade was quickly re-established, and was expanding at 4% per annum throughout the latter part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; China continued to export tea, silk and manufactures, creating a large, favorable [[Balance of trade|trade balance]] with the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphey&quot;&gt;Murphey (2007), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting inflow of silver expanded the money supply, facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), pp. 587, 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Qing-dynasty-vases.jpg|thumb|280px|Qing Dynasty vases, in the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian|Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]], [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].]]
The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; To give people more incentives to participate in the market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the [[corvée]] system with a head tax used to hire labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), pp. 593, 595.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), pp. 572–573, 599–600.&lt;/ref&gt; Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licences and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Wang (2003), pp. 606, 609.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century the population had risen to 300 million from approximately 150 million during the late Ming Dynasty. The drastic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the [[Americas]], including peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize. New species of rice from [[Southeast Asia]] led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronized literature, theater and the arts. Cloth and handicraft production boomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphey&quot;/&gt;

==Arts and Culture==
Under the Qing, traditional forms of art flourished and innovations were made at many levels and in many types. High levels of literacy, prosperous cities, successful publishing industry, and the Confucian emphasis on cultivation all fed a lively and creative set of cultural fields.

The Manchu emperors were generally deft at poetry and often skilled in painting, and offered their patronage to Confucian culture. The Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors, for instance, embraced Chinese traditions both to control them and to proclaim their own legitimacy. The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'', a rime dictionary published in 1711, and the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference. The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' completed in 1782. Court painters made new versions of the Song Dynasty masterpiece, [[Zhang Zeduan]]'s ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' whose depiction of a prosperous and happy realm demonstrated the beneficence of the emperor. The emperors undertook tours of the south and commissioned monumental scrolls to depict the grandeur of the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;“Recording the Grandeur of the Qing.” [[Chinese painting]] [http://www.learn.columbia.edu/nanxuntu/start.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial patronage also encouraged the industrial production of [[Chinese ceramics|ceramics]] and  [[Chinese export porcelain]].

Yet the most impressive work aesthetically was done among the scholars and urban elite. [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsmia.org/art-of-asia/history/dynasty-ching.cfm Minneapolis Institute of Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  remained a central interest to both court painters and [[Scholar-officials|scholar-gentry]] who considered the [[Four Arts]] part of their cultural identity and social standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/qing_1/hd_qing_1.htm “Qing Dynasty, Painting,” Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting of the [[Chinese art#Early Qing painting|early years of the dynasty]] included such painters as the orthodox [[Four Wangs]] and the individualists [[Bada Shanren]] (1626-1705) and [[Shitao]] (1641-1707). The nineteenth century saw such innovations as the [[Shanghai school]] and the Lingnan School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingnanart.com/home.htm &quot;The Lingnan School of Painting,&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; which used the technical skills of tradition to set the stage for modern painting.

[[Chinese literature|Literature]] grew to new heights in the Qing period. [[Qing poetry|Poetry]] continued as a mark of the cultivated gentleman, but women wrote in larger and larger numbers and [[:Category:Qing Dynasty poets|poets]] came from all walks of life. [[Pu Songling]] brought the short story form to a new level in his ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', published in the mid-18th century, and [[Shen Fu]] demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in ''[[Six Records of a Floating Life|Six Chapters of a Floating Life]]'', written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in [[Cao Xueqin]]'s ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as [[Wu Jingzi]]'s ''[[The Scholars (novel)|The Scholars]]'' (1750) and [[Li Ruzhen]]'s  ''[[Flowers in the Mirror]]'' (1827).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/assets_news/china/berkshire_mingdynastysample.pdf &quot;Ming and Qing Novels,&quot; ''Berkshire Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In drama, [[Kong Shangren]]'s [[Kunqu]] (southern) opera ''[[The Peach Blossom Fan]]'', completed in 1699, portrayed the tragic downfall of the Ming dynasty in romantic terms. The most prestigious form became the so-called [[Peking Opera]], though local and folk opera were also widely popular.

The gentleman gourmet, such as [[Yuan Mei#Yuan as a gastronome|Yuan Mei]], applied aesthetic standards to the art of cooking, eating, and appreciation of [[Chinese tea culture|tea]] at a time when [[Columbian Exchange|New World crops and products]] entered everyday life. The [[Manchu Han Imperial Feast]], although probably never common, reflected the appreciation by Han Chinese for Manchu culinary customs.

By the end of the nineteenth century, all elements of artistic and cultural life had recognized and begun to come to terms with world culture as found in the West and Japan. Classically trained Confucian scholars such as [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Wang Guowei]] broke the ground later cultivated in the [[New Culture Movement]].
