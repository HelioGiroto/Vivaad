{{History of war}}
'''Industrial warfare'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nLM1Kolw_vMC&amp;pg=PA410&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;dq=Industrial+warfare&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GIj3EJYEPR&amp;sig=GgDJjZlo0-96NLFWnHzP7Y2i1Us&amp;hl=en#PPA409,M1 p.410, Christon I. Archer, World History of Warfare]&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of warfare]] ranging roughly from the early nineteenth century and the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], which saw the rise of [[nation-state]]s, capable of creating and equipping large armies and navies through the process of [[industrialization]].  

The era featured [[Levée en masse|mass-conscripted]] armies, rapid transportation (first on [[Rail transport|railroads]], then by [[sealift|sea]] and [[airlift|air]]), [[telegraph]] and [[wireless]] communications, and the concept of [[total war]]. In terms of technology, this era saw the rise of [[rifled]] [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] infantry weapons capable of [[Repeating rifle|high rates of fire]], high-velocity [[breech-loading]] artillery, [[chemical weapons]], [[armoured warfare]], [[Ironclad warship|metal]] warships, [[submarine]]s, and [[aircraft]].

==Total war==
{{main|Total war}}

One of the main features of Industrial warfare is the concept of &quot;total war&quot;.  The term was coined during [[World War I]] by [[Erich Ludendorff]] (and again in his 1935 book &quot;Total War&quot;), which called for the complete mobilization and subordination of all resources, including policy and social systems, to the German [[war effort]].  It has also come to mean waging warfare with absolute ruthlessness, and its most identifiable legacy today has been the reintroduction of [[civilian]]s and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying a country's ability to engage in war.

There are several reasons for the rise of total warfare in the nineteenth century.  The main one is industrialization.  As countries' capital and natural resources grew, it became clear that some forms of warfare demanded more resources than others.  Consequently, the greater cost of warfare became evident.  An industrialized nation could distinguish and then choose the intensity of warfare that it wished to engage in.  

Additionally, warfare was becoming more [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and required greater [[infrastructure]].  Soldiers could no longer live off the land, but required an extensive support network of people behind the lines to keep them fed and armed.  This required the mobilization of the [[home front]].  Modern concepts like [[propaganda]] were first used in order to boost production and maintain [[morale]], while [[rationing]] took place to provide more war material.

The earliest modern example of total war was the [[American Civil War]].  [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] were convinced that, if the North was to be victorious, the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage war had to be definitively crushed.  They, therefore, believed that to break the backbone of the South, the North had to employ [[scorched earth]] tactics, or as Sherman called it, &quot;Hard War&quot;.  Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey,Thomas and David Kennedy: &quot;The American Pageant&quot;, page 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in contrast to later conflicts, the damage done by Sherman was almost entirely limited to property destruction.  In Georgia alone, Sherman claimed he and his men had caused $100,000,000 in damages{{cn|date=August 2012}}.

==Conscription==
[[Image:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|right|thumb| Soldiers engaged in trench warfare during the American Civil War.]]
{{main|Conscription}}

Conscription is the compulsory enrollment of civilians into military service. Conscription allowed the [[French Republic]] to form ''[[La Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called &quot;the nation in arms&quot;, which successfully battled European professional armies.

Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.  For instance, during [[World War I]], bitter political disputes broke out in [[Canada]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]), [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]],  [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (See [[Compulsory Military Training (in New Zealand)|Compulsory Military Training]]) over conscription. Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during [[World War II]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]). Both South Africa and Australia put limits on where conscripts could fight in WWII. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future. 

[[Russia]], as well as many smaller nations such as [[Switzerland]], retain mainly conscript armies.

==Transportation==
[[Image:Railroad Cannon.jpg|right|thumb|The advent of railroads (such as this one during the American Civil War) allowed armies to cover larger distances in shorter times while suffering minimal fatigue.]]

===Land===
{{main|Motorised infantry}}
Prior to the invention of the motorized transport, troops were transported from place to place by wagons, horses and their own two feet.  With the advent of locomotives, large groups of soldiers, supplies and equipment were able to be transported faster and in numbers far too large for the old methods.  To counter this, an opposing army would destroy rail tracks to hinder their [[Enemy (military)|enemies]]' movements.  The army of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] during the [[American Civil War]], for example, would tear up tracks, heat them up and [[Sherman's neckties|wrap them around trees]].

The mass transportation of soldiers was further revolutionized with the advent of the [[internal combustion engine]] and the [[automobile]].  Combined with the widespread use of the machine gun, the horse, after millennia of use, was finally supplanted in its war time role. During both the First and Second World Wars, trucks were used to carry soldiers and materials, while cars and jeeps were used to scout enemy positions.

{{main|Mechanized infantry}}
The mechanization of infantry occurred during the second world war.  The [[tank]], a product of [[World War I]] invented by the British to break through trenches while withstanding machine gun fire, while discounted by many early on as not being an important factor in warfare, came into its own.  Tanks evolved from thin-skinned, lumbering vehicles into fast, powerful war machines of [[Tank classification|various types]] that dominated the battlefield and allowed the [[Nazi Germany|German]]s to conquer most of Europe.  As a result of the tank's evolution, a number of armored transport vehicles appeared, such as [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[amphibious vehicles]].

After the war ended, armored transports continued to evolve.  The armored car and train largely declined and faded in use, largely becoming relegated to military and civilian use as transportation for [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]]s.  [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s rose to prominence with the creation of the [[Red Army|Soviet]] [[BMP-1]].  IFVs are a more combat capable version of the APC, with heavier armaments (such as [[autocannon]]s), while still retaining the ability to transport soldiers into and out of battles.

===Sea===
{{main|Sealift}}
Sealift is a [[military logistics]] term referring to the use of [[cargo ship]]s for the [[Military deployment|deployment]] of military assets, such as [[weapon]]ry, military personnel, and [[materiel]] supplies. It complements other means of transport, such as [[strategic airlift]]ers, in order to enhance a [[Sovereign state|state]]'s ability to [[power projection|project power]]. A state's sealift capabilities may include civilian-operated ships that normally operate by contract, but which can be chartered or commandeered during times of military necessity to supplement government-owned [[naval fleet]]s.  

During World War I, the [[United States]] bought, borrowed or commandeered vessels of various types, ranging from pleasure craft to ocean liners to transport the [[American Expeditionary Force]] to Europe.  Many of these ships were scrapped, sold or returned to their owners after the war ended.

===Air===
{{main|Airlift (military)}}

There are two different kinds of airlifts in warfare, a strategic airlift and a [[tactical airlift]].  A strategic airlift is the use transporting of weapons, supplies and personnel over long distances (from a base in one country to another base in another country for example) using large [[cargo aircraft]].  This contrasts with tactical airlifts, which involves transporting the same above items within a [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]].  This usually involves cargo planes with shorter ranges and slower speeds, but higher maneuverability.

==Land warfare==
{{main|Land warfare}}
[[Image:Sherman-korea.jpg|thumb|right|An American [[M4 Sherman]] in action during the [[Korean War]].]]

Land warfare, as the name implies, takes place on land. The most common type of warfare, it can encompass several modes and locales, including [[Urban warfare|urban]], [[Arctic warfare|arctic]] and [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] warfare. 

The early part of the nineteenth century from 1815 to 1848 saw a long period of peace in Europe, accompanied by extraordinary industrial expansion. The industrial age brought about various technological advancements, each with their own implication. Land warfare moved from visual-range and semi person-to-person combat of the previous era, to indiscriminate and impersonal, &quot;beyond visual range&quot; warfare. The [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856) saw the introduction of trench warfare, long-range artillery, railroads, the telegraph and the rifle. The mechanized mass-destruction of enemy combatants grew ever more deadly: in World War I (1914-1918) machine-guns, barbed wire, chemical weapons and land-mines entered the battlefield. The deadly stalemated [[trench warfare | trench-warfare]] stage was finally passed with the advent of the modern armored tank late in the First World War. 

One major trend involved the transition away from massed infantry fire and [[human waves]] to more refined tactics. This became possible with the superseding of earlier weapons like the highly inaccurate [[musket]].

===Technological advances===
{{main|Rifling|Artillery|Machine gun}}
{{See also|Field artillery in the American Civil War}}
[[Image:60 pounder Cape Helles June 1915.jpg|right|thumb|A British [[artillery|artillery piece]] in action during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], 1915.]]

''Rifling'' refers to the act of adding spiral grooves to the inside the barrel of a firearm.  The grooves would cause a projectile to spin as it traveled down the barrel, giving it added range and accuracy.  Once rifling became easier and practical, a new type of firearm was introduced, the [[rifle]]. It gave soldiers the ability to specifically target an enemy soldier, rather than have large numbers of troops fire in a general direction. It effectively broke up groups of soldiers into smaller more maneuverable units.

''Artillery'' are large guns designed to fire large projectiles a great distance. Early artillery pieces were large and cumbersome with very slow rates of fire. This reduced their use to that in sieges, by both defenders and attackers. However, with the advent of the industrial age and various technological advancements, lighter, yet powerful and accurate artillery pieces could be produced. This gave rise to [[field artillery]] which were used on a tactical level to support troops.

''Machine guns'' are fully automatic guns. In this era of warfare they only existed as mounted support weapons, automatic firearms had yet to be developed. Early machine guns as invented by Gatling, were hand cranked but evolved into truly automatic machine guns by Maxim at the end of the era. Machine guns were valued for their ability to smash infantry formations, especially attacking enemy formations when they were dense. This, along with effective field artillery changed tactics drastically.

===Static defense===
Static defenses evolved from the use of permanent fortifications that were direct descendants of medieval castles. As artillery improved in destructive power and penetrative ability, more modern fortifications were developed, using first thicker layers of stone, then concrete and steel. After naval artillery developed the turret - a moving cannon platform - land fortifications started to use this method as well. Between the World Wars, France built an &quot;impregnable&quot; underground steel and concrete fortification that ran the full length of the German-French border. This [[Maginot Line]]  failed to stop the German tanks in 1940: they bypassed the fortifications by invading through neighboring Belgium. 

Temporary fortifications. {{details|Trench warfare}} As artillery and rifles allowed the killing of enemy personnel at a longer effective range, soldiers started to dig into temporary fortifications. These included massive trenches as used in World War I, and individual soldier-sized &quot;fox holes&quot; which became more common in World War II.

===Maneuver warfare===
[[Image:UH-1D helicopters in Vietnam 1966.jpg|right|thumb| Starting in 1965, commanders could insert large forces behind enemy lines, first by plane and later by helicopter.]]
{{main|Maneuver warfare}}

Maneuver had existed throughout military history - from soldiers marching on the field to using horses in cavalry formations. It was not until the advent of mechanized transport over unprepared terrain, such as fields and deserts, using tanks and armored vehicles, that &quot;maneuver warfare&quot; became feasible. First used by the German army in Poland and France in the Second World War,  [[Blitzkrieg]] or &quot;lightning war&quot; saw whole armies moved rapidly on tracked and armored fighting vehicles. During the war airborne movement was used, with soldiers dropped to the battlefield by parachute by both the Germans and the Allies. After the war{{when|date=February 2012}} developments in helicopters brought a more practical way to transport troops by air.

==Naval warfare==
{{main|Naval warfare}}
[[Image:Cumberland rammed by Merrimac.png|right|thumb|The sinking of the ''[[USS Cumberland (1842)|Cumberland]]'' by the Confederate [[ironclad]] ''[[CSS Virginia|Virginia]]'' in 1862 marked the beginning of the end for wooden warships.]]

===Ironclads and Dreadnoughts===
The period after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] was one of intensive experimentation with new technology; [[steam power]] for ships appeared in the 1810s, improved [[metallurgy]] and machining technique produced larger and deadlier guns, and the development of explosive shells, capable of demolishing a wooden ship at a single blow, in turn required the addition of iron armor, which led to [[ironclads]].  

The famous [[Battle of Hampton Roads|battle of the ''CSS Virginia'' and ''USS Monitor'']] in the [[American Civil War]] was the duel of ironclads that symbolized the changing times.  Although the battle was inconclusive, nations around the world subsequently raced to convert their fleets to iron, as ironclads had shown themselves to be clearly superior to wooden ships in their ability to withstand enemy fire.

In the late nineteenth century, naval warfare was revolutionized by [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s book ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]''.  Mahan argued that in the Anglo-French wars of the 18th century and 19th centuries, domination of the sea was the deciding factor in the outcome, and therefore control of seaborne commerce was critical to military victory.  Mahan argued that the best way to achieve naval domination was through large fleets of concentrated [[capital ships]], as opposed to [[commerce raiders]].  His books were closely studied in all the Great Powers, influencing their naval [[arms race]] in the years prior to World War I.

[[Image:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H63596.jpg|thumb|right|In 1906 the British warship ''[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS Dreadnought]]'' became the first warship to have both a uniform main battery and steam turbine engines, creating a standard for warships that lasted until the 1940s.]]

As the century came to a close, the familiar modern battleship began to emerge; a [[steel]]-armored ship, entirely dependent on steam, and sporting a number of large shell guns mounted in turrets arranged along the centerline of the main deck. The ultimate design was reached in 1906 with ''[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS Dreadnought]]'' which entirely dispensed with smaller guns, her main guns being sufficient to sink any existing ship of the time.  

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] and particularly the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905 was the first test of the new concepts, resulting a stunning Japanese victory and the destruction of dozens of Russian ships.  [[World War I]] pitted the old Royal Navy against the new navy of [[Imperial Germany]], culminating in the 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]].  Following the war, many nations agreed to limit the size of their fleets in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers.  

Growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ship than before: the Japanese battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'', launched in 1941, displaced 72,000 tons and mounted {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} guns.  However, this marked the climax of &quot;big gun&quot; warfare, as aircraft would gradually play a larger role in warfare.  By the 1960s, battleships had all-but vanished from the fleets of the world.

===Aircraft carriers===
[[Image:VT-6TBDs.jpg|right|thumb|In the 1940s aircraft carriers supplanted battleships as the centerpiece of the fleet.  Here, American [[torpedo bombers]] prepare to take off during the [[Battle of Midway]] in 1942.]]

Between the two world wars, the first [[aircraft carrier]]s appeared, initially as a way to circumvent the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty (many of the first carriers were converted battlecruisers).  Though several ships had previously been designed to launch and in some cases, the first true &quot;flat-top&quot; carrier was ''[[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS Argus]]'', launched in December 1917.  

By the start of the Second World War, aircraft carriers typically carried three types of aircraft: [[torpedo bombers]], which could also be also used for conventional horizontal bombing and reconnaissance; [[dive bombers]], also used for reconnaissance; and fighters for fleet defence and bomber escort duties.  Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, these aircraft were almost always small, single-engined warplanes.  The first true demonstration of naval air power was the victory of the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of Taranto]] in 1940, which set the stage for Japan's much larger and more famous [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the following year.  

Two days after Pearl Harbor, the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''HMS Prince of Wales'' and ''HMS Repulse'']], marked the beginning of the end for the battleship era.  Following World War II, aircraft carriers continued to remain key to navies throughout the latter 20th century, moving in the 1950s to jets launched from [[Supercarrier]]s, behemoths which could displace as much as 100,000 tons.

===Submarines===
&lt;!-- hiding deleted image [[Image:I-400.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Japan|Japanese]]  [[submarine]] in 1945.  Starting in World War I, submarines began to play a significant role in naval warfare, first as submersible [[torpedo boats]] and later as commerce raiders.]]
 --&gt;
Just as important was the development of [[submarines]] to travel underneath the sea, at first for short dives, then later to be able to spend weeks or months underwater powered by a [[nuclear reactor]].  The first successful submarine attack in wartime was in 1864 by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] submarine ''[[H.L. Hunley]]'' which sank the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Housatonic (1861)|USS Housatonic]]''.  

In both World Wars, submarines primarily exerted their power by sinking [[merchant ships]] using [[torpedoes]], as well as other warships.  All nations practiced [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in which submarines sank merchant ships without warning, but the only successful campaign during this period was America's submarine war against Japan during the [[Pacific War]].  In the 1950s the [[Cold War]] inspired the development of ballistic missile submarines, each one loaded with dozens of nuclear-armed missiles and with orders to launch them from sea should the other nation attack.

==Aerial warfare==
{{main|Aerial warfare}}
[[File:B-17Gs 381st BG en route to target c1944.jpg|right|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers flying in a large attack formation]]
The first use of airplanes in war was the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911, when the Italians carried out several [[reconnaissance]] and [[bombing]] missions.  During World War I both sides made use of [[balloons]] and airplanes for reconnaissance and directing artillery fire.  To prevent enemy reconnaissance, some airplane pilots began attacking other airplanes and balloons, first with small arms carried in the cockpit, and later with machine guns mounted on the aircraft.  Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing and dropping of propaganda leaflets. 

The German air force carried out the first [[terror bombing]] raids, using [[Zeppelins]] to drop bombs on Britain.  By the end of the war airplanes had become specialised into [[bombers]], [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and [[surveillance aircraft]].  Most of these airplanes were [[biplanes]] with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and [[air-cooled]] engines.  

Between 1918 and 1939 aircraft technology developed very rapidly.  By 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed [[monoplanes]], often with stressed skins and liquid cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled (and [[oxygen masks]] become commonplace); ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.  

Some theorists, most famously [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] and [[Giulio Douhet]], believed that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future, and argued that future wars would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air.  This concept was called [[strategic bombing]].  Douhet also argued in ''[[The Command of the Air]]'' (1921) that future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I-style trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy's forces directly at their vulnerable civilian population, which Douhet believed would cause these populations to rise up in revolt to stop the bombing.  

Others, such as [[Billy Mitchell]], saw the potential of air power to neutralize the striking power of naval surface fleets.  Mitchell himself proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was finally in 1921 when he commanded a squadron of bombers that sank the ex-German battleship [[SMS Ostfriesland|SMS ''Ostfriesland'']] with aerial bombs.  (See [[Industrial warfare#Naval warfare]])

During the Second World War, there was a debate between [[strategic bombing]] and [[tactical bombing]].  Strategic bombing missions focused on targets such as [[factory|factories]], railroads, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[city|cities]], and required [[Strategic bomber|heavy four-engine bombers]] carrying large payloads flying deep into enemy territory.  Tactical bombing focused on troop concentrations, command and control facilities, airfields, and ammunition dumps, and required [[dive bombers]] and [[fighter bombers]], small aircraft that could fly low over the battlefield.  

In the early years of World War II, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' focused on [[tactical bombing]], using large numbers of [[Junkers Ju-87|Ju-87 Stukas]] as &quot;flying artillery&quot; for land offensives.  Artillery was slow and required time to set up a firing position, whereas aircraft were better able keep up with the fast advances of the German panzer columns.  Close air support greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the [[Battle of France]].  It was also important in [[amphibious warfare]], where aircraft carriers could provide support for soldiers landing on the beaches.

[[File:Boeing-Whichata B-29 Assembly Line - 1944.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers under construction on an assembly line]]
[[Strategic bombing]], by contrast, was unlike anything the world has seen before or since.  In 1940, the Germans attempted to force Britain to surrender through attacks on its airfields and factories, and then on its cities in [[The Blitz]] in what became the [[Battle of Britain]], the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air.  The campaigns conducted by the Allies in Europe and the Pacific could involve thousands of aircraft dropping tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions over a single city.

Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the [[Cold War]]. The postwar years saw a rapid conversion to [[Jet engine|jet]] power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft. Until the advent of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly-developed nuclear deterrent; each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high-altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union.

==The end of industrial warfare==
{{main|Modern warfare}}

===Nuclear warfare===
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}
[[Image:Bumper8 launch-GPN-2000-000613.jpg|thumb|right|US test launch of a German [[V-2]] [[ballistic missile]].]]

The use of nuclear weapons first came into being during the last months of World War II, with the dropping of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].  This was the only use of nuclear weapons in combat.  For a decade after [[World War II]], the [[United States]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] (and to a lesser extent the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]) developed and maintained a strategic force of bombers that would be able to attack any potential aggressor from bases inside their countries.  

Before the development of a capable strategic missile force in the Soviet Union, much of the war-fighting doctrine held by western nations revolved around the use of a large number of smaller nuclear weapons used in a tactical role. It is arguable if such use could be considered &quot;limited&quot; however, because it was believed that the US would use their own strategic weapons (mainly bombers at the time) should the USSR deploy any kind of nuclear weapon against civilian targets.

A new revolution in thinking occurred with the introduction of the [[ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), which the Soviet Union first successfully tested in the late 1950s. To deliver a warhead to a target, a missile was far less expensive than a bomber that could do the same job. Moreover, at the time it was impossible to intercept ICBMs due to their high altitude and speed. 

In the 1960s, another major shift in nuclear doctrine occurred with the development of the [[SLBM|submarine-based nuclear missile]] (SLBM). It was hailed by military theorists as a weapon that would assure a surprise attack would not destroy the capability to retaliate, and therefore would make nuclear war less likely.

===The Cold War===
{{main|The Cold War}}
Since the end of World War II, no industrial nations have fought such a large, decisive war, due to the availability of weapons that are so destructive that their use would offset the advantages of victory. The fighting of a total war where nuclear weapons are used is something that instead of taking years and the full mobilisation of a country's resources such as in World War II, would take tens of minutes. Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peace time defence budgets.

By the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the Cold War between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] involved thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed at each side by the other. Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as [[Mutually assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), the idea that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other. This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], &quot;The living will envy the dead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/1257.html Attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, speaking of nuclear war] [http://www.bartleby.com/ www.bartleby.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the [[superpower]]s sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in [[proxy wars]], military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs.

In the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].
