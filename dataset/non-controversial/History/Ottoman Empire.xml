The empire reached its peak at 1590, covering parts of Asia, Europe and Africa. The reign of the long-lived [[Ottoman dynasty]] lasted for 623 years, from 27 July 1299&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/grammarofturkish00davirich#page/xxvi/mode/2up |title=A grammar of the Turkish language |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=dn&gt;According to the British historian [[Edward Gibbon]], &quot;It was on the twenty seventh of July in the year twelve hundred and ninety nine of the Christian era that Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia…&quot; ({{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=yy4MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA185}}), hence the date is considered the founding day of the Ottoman state.&lt;/ref&gt; to 1 November 1922, when the monarchy in [[Turkey]] was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;''Temel Britannica'', Ana Yayıncılık-Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1992, Cilt 18, Sh. 41–96; Türkiye.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Ottoman Empire was one of the most powerful states in the world – a multinational, multilingual empire that stretched from the southern borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the outskirts of [[Vienna]], [[Royal Hungary]] (modern [[Slovakia]]) and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the north to [[Yemen]] and [[Eritrea]] in the south; from [[Algeria]] in the west to [[Azerbaijan]] in the east;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Turnbull, The Ottoman Empire 1326–1699, Essential histories, vol. 62, Essential histories, 2003.

With [[İstanbul|Constantinople]] as its capital and vast control of lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean basin]], the empire was at the center of interactions between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world]]s for over six centuries.

After the international recognition of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|new Turkish parliament]] headquartered in [[Ankara]], by means of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] signed on 24 July 1923, the Turkish parliament proclaimed on 29 October 1923 the establishment of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] as the new Turkish State that succeeded and formally ended the defunct Ottoman Empire, in line with the treaty.&lt;ref group=dn&gt;The Sultanate was [[Abolishment of the Ottoman Sultanate|abolished]] on 1 November 1922. [[Mehmed VI]], the last Ottoman Sultan, departed from Istanbul on 17 November 1922, which does not mean that the Ottoman Empire ended completely and stopped all its functions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne |title=Full text of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) |publisher=Wwi.lib.byu.edu |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Caliphate]] was abolished on 3 March 1924; the [[Caliphate]]'s authority and properties were transferred to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].

==Name==
{{Main|Names of the Ottoman Empire}}
In [[Ottoman Turkish]] the Empire was referred to as ''Devlet-i ʿAliyye-yi ʿO&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;mâniyye'' (دَوْلَتِ عَلِيّهٔ عُثمَانِیّه),&lt;ref name=&quot;twareekh.com&quot;/&gt; or alternatively ''Osmanlı Devleti'' (عثمانلى دولتى).&lt;ref group=dn&gt;Starting from the 19th century, the name ''Osmanlı Devleti'' (Ottoman State) became popular among the Ottoman citizens and officials. Before the 1800s, the name ''Osmanlı Devleti'' wasn't officially used, but there are records showing that this name was used informally by Ottoman citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]] it is known as ''Osmanlı Devleti'' or ''Osmanlı İmparatorluğu''. In older English usage, mostly the 19th century and earlier, it was usually referred to as the ''Turkish Empire'' or ''Turkey''.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_London_Gazzette_(Thursday,_9_January_1672).jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further2|[[Ottoman Dynasty]]|[[Kayı tribe]]}}
[[File:Battle of Nicopolis, 1396, Facsimile of a Miniature Conserved in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul-.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Nicopolis]], 1396]]
With the demise of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] (c. 1300), [[Anatolia]] was divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called [[Anatolian Beyliks|Ghazi emirates]]. By 1300, a weakened [[Byzantine Empire]] had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to ten Ghazi principalities. One of the Ghazi emirates was led by [[Osman I]] (1258&lt;ref name=&quot;Osmanli700&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sultans: Osman Gazi |url=http://www.theottomans.org/english/family/osman.asp |publisher=TheOttomans.org |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 1326), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of [[Ertuğrul]], around [[Eskişehir]] in western Anatolia. Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In this period, a formal [[Ruling institution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] was created whose institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire, but that would prove vital to the Ottoman Empire's rapid expansion. The government used the socio-political institution known as the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system, under which religious and ethnic minorities were allowed to manage their own affairs with substantial independence from central control. Such religious tolerance resulted in limited opposition when conquering other territories and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theotheristanbul.com/who-are-the-ottomans/&lt;/ref&gt; Osman I openly welcomed any and all fighting men dedicated to the advancement of his cause.

In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[History of the Balkans|Balkans]]. Osman's son, [[Orhan]], captured the city of [[Bursa]] in 1324 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern Anatolia. The important city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1387. The Ottoman victory at [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo in 1389]] effectively marked [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|the end of Serbian power]] in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale [[Crusades|crusade]] of the [[Middle Ages]], failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks.

With the extension of Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic [[Sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|conquest of Constantinople]] became a crucial objective. The Empire controlled nearly all former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine lands]] surrounding the city, but the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] were temporarily relieved when [[Timur]] invaded Anatolia in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402. He took Sultan [[Bayezid I]] as a prisoner. The capture of Bayezid I threw the Turks into disorder. The state fell into a civil war that lasted from 1402 to 1413, as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when [[Mehmed I]] emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the [[Ottoman Interregnum|Interregnum]], also known as the ''Fetret Devri'' in [[Ottoman Turkish]].

Part of the Ottoman territories in the Balkans (such as Thessaloniki, Macedonia and Kosovo) were temporarily lost after 1402, but were later recovered by [[Murad II]] between the 1430s and 1450s. On 10 November 1444, Murad II defeated the [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Wallachia]]n armies under [[Władysław III of Poland]] (also King of Hungary) and [[John Hunyadi|János Hunyadi]] at the [[Battle of Varna]], which was the final battle of the [[Crusade of Varna]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodnar, Edward W. ''Ciriaco d'Ancona e la crociata di Varna, nuove prospettive''. ''Il Veltro'' 27, nos. 1–2 (1983): 235–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halecki, Oscar, ''The Crusade of Varna''. New York, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, János Hunyadi prepared another army (of Hungarian and Wallachian forces) to attack the Turks, but was again defeated by Murad II at the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] in 1448.

====Expansion and apogee (1453–1566)====
[[File:Moldovita murals 2010 41.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Army before Constantinople in 1453, [[Moldovița Monastery]]]]
The son of Murad II, [[Mehmed II]], reorganized the state and the military, and captured [[fall of Constantinople|Constantinople]] on 29 May 1453. Mehmed allowed the [[Orthodox Church]] to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting Ottoman authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Stone, Norman &quot;Turkey in the Russian Mirror&quot; pages 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark &amp; Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: London, 2004 page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Because of bad relations between the latter Byzantine Empire and the states of western Europe, the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire entered a [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|period of expansion]]. The Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]]. It also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Karpat, Kemal H. |title=The Ottoman state and its place in world history |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=111 |isbn=90-04-03945-7 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=dn&gt;A lock-hold on trade between western Europe and Asia is often cited as a primary motivation for [[Isabella I of Castile]] to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s westward journey to find a sailing route to Asia and, more generally, for European seafaring nations to explore alternative trade routes (e.g. K. D. Madan, ''Life and travels of Vasco Da Gama'' (1998), 9; I. Stavans, ''Imagining Columbus: the literary voyage'' (2001), 5; W.B. Wheeler and S. Becker, ''Discovering the American Past. A Look at the Evidence: to 1877'' (2006), 105). This traditional viewpoint has been attacked as unfounded in an influential article by A.H. Lybyer (&quot;The Ottoman Turks and the Routes of Oriental Trade”, ''English Historical Review'', 120 (1915), 577–588), who sees the rise of Ottoman power and the beginnings of Portuguese and Spanish explorations as unrelated events. His view has not been universally accepted (cf. K.M. Setton, ''The Papacy and the Levant (1204–1571), Vol. 2: The Fifteenth Century (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 127)'' (1978), 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east, the Ottoman Turks took [[Baghdad]] from the [[Persia]]ns in 1535, gaining control of [[Mesopotamia]] and naval access to the [[Persian Gulf]].

[[Early Modern France|France]] and the Ottoman Empire, united by mutual opposition to [[Habsburg]] rule, became strong allies. The French conquests of [[Siege of Nice|Nice (1543)]] and [[Invasion of Corsica (1553)|Corsica (1553)]] occurred as a joint venture between the forces of the French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and Suleiman, and were commanded by the Ottoman admirals [[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]] and [[Turgut Reis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Imber|first=Colin|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300–1650: The Structure of Power|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0-333-61386-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month prior to the siege of Nice, France supported the Ottomans with an artillery unit during the Ottoman [[siege of Esztergom (1543)|conquest of Esztergom]] in 1543. After further advances by the Turks in 1543, the Habsburg ruler [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] officially recognized Ottoman ascendancy in Hungary in 1547. 

By the end of Suleiman's reign, the Empire's population totaled about 15,000,000 people.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=206}} The Empire became a dominant naval force, controlling much of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 61&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a significant and accepted part of the European political sphere.

====Revolts and revival (1566–1683)====

[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|left|Ottoman Empire, 1481-1683]]
The effective military and bureaucratic structures of the previous century came under strain during a protracted period of misrule by weak Sultans. The Ottomans gradually fell behind the Europeans in military technology as the innovation that fed the Empire's forceful expansion became stifled by growing religious and intellectual conservatism.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=96}} But in spite of these difficulties, the Empire remained a major expansionist power until the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, which marked the end of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman expansion into Europe]].

The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488 initiated [[Indian Ocean campaigns|a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars]] in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. Economically, the [[Spanish treasure fleet|huge influx]] of [[Spanish dollar|Spanish silver]] from the [[New World]] caused a sharp devaluation of the Ottoman currency and rampant inflation.

Under [[Ivan IV]] (1533–1584), the [[Tsardom of Russia]] expanded into the Volga and Caspian region at the expense of the Tatar khanates. In 1571, the Crimean khan [[Devlet I Giray]], supported by the Ottomans, [[Russo-Crimean War (1571)|burned Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007).

Eizo Matsuki, ''Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern Europe, a Catholic coalition led by [[Philip II of Spain]] won a victory over the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]]. It was a startling, if mostly symbolic,{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=272}} blow to the image of Ottoman invincibility. The battle was far more damaging to the Ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships, which were rapidly replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Kunt &amp; Woodhead (Ed.) &quot;Suleyman The Magnificent and his Age, The Ottoman Empire in the Early Modern World&quot;, Longman 1995, ISBD 0-582-03827-8, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman navy recovered quickly, persuading Venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, allowing the Ottomans to expand and consolidate their position in North Africa.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=67}}

[[Image:Vienna Battle 1683.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Vienna|Second Siege of Vienna]] in 1683.]]
By contrast, the [[Habsburg]] frontier had settled somewhat, a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=71}} The [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] against [[Habsburg]] Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which was never fully solved.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|pp=90-92}} Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited, and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the [[Jelali revolts]] (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Inalcik, Halil. ''An Economic And Social History Of The Ottoman Empire, Vol 1 1300–1600''. Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-57455-2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Empire's population reaching 30,000,000 people by 1600, shortage of land placed further pressure on the government.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=281}}

[[Murad IV]] (1612–1640) recaptured [[Yerevan]] (1635) and Baghdad (1639) from the [[Safavids]] and reasserted central authority, albeit during a brief majority reign.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=73}} The [[Sultanate of women]] (1648–1656) was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. The most prominent women of this period were [[Kösem Sultan]] and her daughter-in-law [[Turhan Hatice]], whose political rivalry culminated in Kösem's murder in 1651.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|pp=74-75}} During the [[Köprülü Era]] (1656–1703), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of [[Grand Vizier]]s from the Köprülü family. The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in [[Transylvania]], the conquest of [[Crete]] completed in 1669 and expansion into Polish southern [[Ukraine]], with the strongholds of [[Khotyn]] and [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] and the territory of [[Podolia]] ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|pp=80-81}}

This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end when Grand Vizier [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]] in May 1683 led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of [[Vienna]] in the [[Great Turkish War]] of 1683–1687. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king [[John III Sobieski|Jan]]{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|pp=81-82}} at the [[Battle of Vienna]]. The alliance of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna, culminating in the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=357}} The Ottomans surrendered control of significant territories, many permanently.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=84}} [[Mustafa II]] (1695–1703) led the counterattack of 1695–96 against the Habsburgs in Hungary, but was undone at the disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Zenta|Zenta]] (11 September 1697).{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|pp=83-84}}

===Stagnation and reform (1683–1827)===
{{main|Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Ottoman Sultan selim III 1789.jpg|thumb|[[Selim III]] receiving dignitaries during an audience at the Gate of Felicity, [[Topkapı Palace]].]]
During this period Russian expansion presented a large and growing threat.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=371}} Accordingly, King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 (part of the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700–1721.){{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=371}} Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan [[Ahmed III]] to declare war on Russia, which resulted in the Ottoman victory at the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710–1711.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=372}} The subsequent [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] signed on 21 July 1718, brought a period of peace between wars.  However, the Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=376}}

Together with Austria, Russia, under Catherine I, engaged in the [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–1739)]]. The [[Treaty of Belgrade]] signed on 18 September 1739, ended this war and resulted in the loss of Serbia and &quot;Little Walachia&quot; to Austria and the port of Azov to the Russians. However following the Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of the Prussians under King Frederick the Great.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=392}} In this long period of Ottoman peace there were [[Science and Technology in the Ottoman Empire#Education|educational and technological reforms]], including the establishment of higher education institutions such as the [[Istanbul Technical University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/?about/history |title=History of the Istanbul Technical University |publisher=Itu.edu.tr |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1734, when an artillery school was established with French teachers in order to impart Western-style artillery methods, the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Stone, Norman &quot;Turkey in the Russian Mirror&quot; pages 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark &amp; Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: London, 2004 page 97&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1754 was the artillery school reopened on a semi-secret basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; In 1726, [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] convinced the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha]], the [[Grand Mufti]], and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press, and later submitted a request to Sultan Ahmed III, who granted Muteferrika the permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] and religious leaders.)&lt;ref name=&quot;katip celebi&quot;&gt;[http://vitrine.library.uu.nl/wwwroot/en/texts/Rarqu54.htm Presentation of Katip Çelebi, ''Kitâb-i Cihân-nümâ li-Kâtib Çelebi'']{{dead link|date=November 2011}}, at the [[Utrecht University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; Muteferrika's press published its first book in 1729, and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes (each having between 500 and 1,000 copies.)&lt;ref name=&quot;katip celebi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;William J.

Under the pretext of pursuing fugitive Polish revolutionaries, Russian troops entered [[Balta, Ukraine|Balta]] an Ottoman-controlled city on the border of Bessarabia and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=396}} This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the First Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774.  The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] of 1774 ended the First Russo-Turkish War and allowed that the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled Rumanian provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia would be allowed freedom to worship.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=405}}

[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour Prozession des Sultans in Istanbul.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of the Sultan in Istanbul, by [[Jean-Baptiste van Mour]]]]
A series of [[History of Russo-Turkish wars|wars]] were fought between the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Ottoman empires from the 18th to the 19th century. By the late 18th century, a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of &quot;Deli Petro&quot; (''Peter the Mad'', as [[Peter the Great]] was known in Turkey) had given the Russians an edge, and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

[[Ottoman military reform efforts]] begin with [[Selim III]] (1789–1807) who made the first major attempts to modernize the army along European lines. These efforts, however, were hampered by reactionary movements, partly from the religious leadership, but primarily from the Janissary corps, who had become anarchic and ineffectual. Jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change, they created a [[Janissary revolts|Janissary revolt]]. Selim's efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic [[Mahmud II]], who eliminated the [[Janissary]] corps in 1826.

The [[Serbian revolution]] (1804–1815) marked the beginning of an era of [[Romantic nationalism|national awakening]] in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Eastern Question]]. [[Suzerainty]] of Serbia as a hereditary monarchy under its own [[Karadjordjevic dynasty|dynasty]] was acknowledged ''de jure'' in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njegos.org/past/liunion.htm |title=Liberation, Independence and Union |publisher=Njegos.org |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berend, Tibor Iván, ''History derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the long nineteenth century'', ([[University of California Press]] Ltd, 2003), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, the [[Ottoman Greece|Greeks]] [[Greek War of Independence|declared war]] on the Sultan. A rebellion that originated in Moldavia as a diversion was followed by the main revolution in the [[Peloponnese]], which, along with the northern part of the [[Gulf of Corinth]], became the first parts of the Ottoman empire to achieve independence (in 1829). By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the [[Sick man of Europe|&quot;sick man&quot;]] by Europeans. The [[suzerainty|suzerain states]] – the [[Principality of Serbia]], Wallachia, [[Moldavia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] – moved towards ''de jure'' independence during the 1860s and 1870s.

===Decline and modernisation (1828–1908)===
{{main|Decline of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[Image:Sultan Mahmud II.jpg|thumb|[[Mahmud II]] started the modernisation of [[Turkey]] by paving the way for the Edict of [[Tanzimat]] in 1839.]]
During the [[Tanzimat]] period (1839–1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law&lt;ref&gt;http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[guild]]s with modern factories. The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul on 23 October 1840.&lt;ref name=PTT&gt;[http://www.ptt.gov.tr/tr/kurumsal/tarihce.html PTT Chronology]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PTT2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptt.gov.tr/index.snet?wapp=histor_en&amp;open=1 |title=History of the Turkish Postal Service |publisher=Ptt.gov.tr |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Morse]] received his first ever patent for the [[telegraphy|telegraph]] in 1847, which was issued by Sultan [[Abdülmecid I|Abdülmecid]] who personally tested the new invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbulcityguide.com/history/body_mansions_palaces.htm Istanbul City Guide: Beylerbeyi Palace]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this successful test, installation works of the first telegraph line (Istanbul-[[Adrianople]]-[[Şumnu]])&lt;ref name=NTVtarih2&gt;[http://www.ntvtarih.com.tr/ NTV Tarih] history magazine, issue of July 2011.

The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the ''[[Kanûn-u Esâsî]]''. The empire's [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional era]], was short-lived. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. The Christian population of the empire, owing to their higher educational levels, started to pull ahead of the Muslim majority, leading to much resentment on the part of the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Turkish_troops_storming_Fort_Shefketil (cropped).jpg|thumb|Turkish troops storming Fort Shefketil during the [[Crimean War]]]]
The [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|declining Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottoman Empire took its [[Ottoman public debt|first foreign loans]] on 4 August 1854,&lt;ref name=Ottomandebthistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gberis.e-monsite.com/categorie,osmanli-borclanma-tarihi-ottoman-debt-history,3219214.html |title=History of the Ottoman public debt |publisher=Gberis.e-monsite.com |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after the beginning of the Crimean War.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Arthur Howard: &quot;The History of Turkey&quot;, page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The war caused an exodus of the [[Crimean Tatars]], about 200,000 Crimean Tatars moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monderusse.revues.org/docannexe1800.html &quot;''Hijra'' and Forced Migration from Nineteenth-Century Russia to the Ottoman Empire&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}, by [[Bryan Glynn Williams]], ''Cahiers du Monde russe'', 41/1, 2000, pp. 79–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the [[Caucasian Wars]], 90% of the [[Circassians]] were exiled from their homelands in the [[Caucasus]] and settled in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Miliutin, &quot;the plan of action decided upon for 1860 was to cleanse [ochistit'] the mountain zone of its indigenous population&quot;, per Richmond, W. &lt;u&gt;The Northwest Caucasus: Past, Present and Future&lt;/u&gt;.

The [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]] swept through many countries during the 19th century, and it affected territories within the Ottoman Empire. A burgeoning [[Nationalism|national consciousness]], together with a growing sense of [[ethnic nationalism]], made nationalistic thought one of the most significant Western ideas imported to the Ottoman Empire. It was forced to deal with nationalism both within and beyond its borders. The number of revolutionary [[List of parties in Ottoman Empire|political parties]] rose dramatically. Uprisings in Ottoman territory had many far-reaching consequences during the 19th century and determined much of Ottoman policy during the early 20th century.

[[File:Opening ceremony of the First Ottoman Parliament at the Dolmabahce Palace in 1876.jpg|thumb|left|Opening ceremony of the First [[Ottoman Parliament]] at the [[Dolmabahce Palace]] in 1876]]
The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] ended with a decisive victory for Russia. As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, [[Romania]] achieved full independence. [[History of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories. In 1878, [[Austria-Hungary]] unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]], but the Ottoman government contested this move and maintained its troops in both provinces.

In return for [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s advocacy for restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the Congress of Berlin, Britain assumed the administration of [[Cyprus]] in 1878&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 228–54&lt;/ref&gt; and later sent troops to [[Egypt]] in 1882 with the pretext of helping the Ottoman government to put down the [[Urabi Revolt]]; effectively gaining control in both territories.

From 1894–96, between 100,000 to 300,000 Armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Taner Akcam|Akcam, Taner]]. ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility''. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006, p. 42. ISBN 0-8050-7932-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the empire's remaining territory in Balkans or to the heartland in Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael (2005), ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', Cambridge University Press, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todorova, Maria (2009), ''Imagining the Balkans'', Oxford University Press, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; By 1923, only Anatolia and eastern [[Thrace]] remained as the Muslim land.&lt;ref&gt;editors: Matthew J.

{{Main|Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire}}
The Ottoman Empire had long been the &quot;[[sick man of Europe]]&quot; and after a series of Balkan wars by 1914 had been driven out of nearly all of Europe and North Africa.  It still controlled 28 million people, of whom 17 million were in modern-day Turkey, 3 million in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and 2.5 million in Iraq. Another 5.5 million people were under nominal Ottoman rule in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Şevket Pamuk, &quot;The Ottoman Economy in World War I&quot; in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) pp 112–36, esp. p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] began after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] (3 July 1908) with the sultan's announcement of the restoration of the [[:s:tr:Kanun-u Esasi|1876 constitution]] and the reconvening of the Ottoman Parliament. It marked the beginning of the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]]. This era is dominated by the politics of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], and the movement that would become known as the [[Young Turks]].

Profiting from the civil strife, [[Austria-Hungary]] officially annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, but pulled its troops out of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], another contested region between the Austrians and Ottomans, to avoid a war.  During the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911–12) in which the Ottoman Empire lost [[Libya]], the [[Balkan League]] declared war against the Ottoman Empire. The Empire lost the  [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13). It lost its [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] territories except [[East Thrace]] and the historic Ottoman capital city of [[Adrianople]] during the war. Some 400,000 Muslims, out of fear of Greek, Serbian or Bulgarian atrocities, left with the retreating Ottoman army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | place = NL | format = PDF | url = http://tulp.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/wap/ejz18.pdf | title = Greek and Turkish refugees and deportees 1912–1924 | publisher = [[Universiteit Leiden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baghdad Railway]] under German control was a proposal to build rail lines into Iraq. The railway was not actually built at this time but its prospect worried the British until that issue was resolved in 1914. The railway did not play a role in the origins of World War I.

In August 1914, the Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], in which it took part in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]]. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] and the [[Siege of Kut]], but there were setbacks as well, such as the disastrous [[Caucasus Campaign]] against the Russians. The United States never declared war against the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker, ed. ''Encyclopedia of World War I'' (2005) p 1080&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab Revolt]] which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans at the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war.

The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed on 30 October 1918, ended the hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre, and was followed with [[occupation of Constantinople]] and subsequent [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was solidified.

===Fall of the Empire===
{{Main|Fall of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[Image:Sultanvahideddin.jpg|thumb|Departure of [[Mehmed VI]], last Sultan of the Ottoman State, 1922.]]
The [[occupation of Constantinople]] along with the [[occupation of İzmir]] mobilized the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]], which won the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–22) under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Kemal Pasha's speech on his arrival in Ankara in November 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sultanate]] was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, [[Mehmed VI|Mehmed VI Vahdettin]] (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The new independent [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (GNA) was internationally recognized with the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923. The GNA officially declared the [[Republic of Turkey#Republic era|Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. The [[Caliphate]] was constitutionally abolished several months later, on 3 March 1924. The Sultan and his family were declared [[150 personae non gratae of Turkey|personae non gratae of Turkey]] and exiled.

In many ways, the circumstances surrounding the Ottoman Empire's fall were a result of tensions between the Empire's different ethnic groups and the various governments' inability to deal with these tensions. The introduction of increased [[cultural rights]], [[civil liberties]] and a [[parliamentary system]] during the [[Tanzimat]] proved too late to reverse the [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|nationalistic]] and [[secession]]ist trends that had already been set in motion since the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date = September 2011}}

==Government==
{{Main|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[Image:Pera Museum 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Ambassadors at [[Topkapı Palace]]]]
The [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]] was a very simple system that had two main dimensions: the military administration and the civil administration.
The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The Ottomans practiced a system in which the state (as in the Byzantine Empire) had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p=38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders within the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapucu&quot;&gt;Naim Kapucu,Hamit Palabıyık ''Turkish public administration: from tradition to the modern age&quot;, p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Ottoman dynasty]]&quot; or, as an institution, &quot;[[House of Osman]]&quot; was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Black, ''ibid'', page 197&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Osmanlı dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapucu&quot;/&gt;

The highest position in Islam, ''[[caliphate]]'', was claimed by the sultan, which was established as [[Ottoman Caliphate]]. The Ottoman sultan, ''[[Padishah|pâdişâh]]'' or &quot;lord of kings&quot;, served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The [[Imperial Harem]] was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the [[Valide Sultan]]. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the &quot;[[Sultanate of the women|Sultanate of Women]]&quot;. New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the [[palace school]] was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the [[Madrasa]] ({{lang-ota|''Medrese''}}) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Istanbul and the civilization of the Ottoman Empire'', p151&lt;/ref&gt; The second track was a free [[boarding school]] for the Christians, the ''[[Enderûn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/471488/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh |title=Enderun and Matraki }}&lt;/ref&gt; which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in [[Rumelia]] and/or the Balkans, a process known as [[Devshirme in the Ottoman Palace School|Devshirme]] (''{{lang|ota|Devşirme}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H Karpat, ''Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis'', p204&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Thomas allom, c1840, The Enterance to Divan.png|thumb|left|''Bâb-ı Âlî'', the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]]]]
Though the sultan was the supreme monarch, the sultan's political and executive authority was delegated. The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]] (after the 17th century it was renamed the &quot;[[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]&quot;). The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''Beylik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a [[Grand Vizier]] was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black p199&quot;/&gt; [[Image:Tughra Suleiman.jpg|thumb|Tughra of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520)]] Throughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces. The representatives formed the [[Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire]].

The rapidly expanding empire used loyal, skilled subjects to manage the Empire, whether [[Albanians]], [[Phanariotes|Phanariot Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Serbs]], [[Hungarians]] or others. The incorporation of Greeks (and other Christians), Muslims, and Jews revolutionized its administrative system.&lt;ref&gt;[[The History of Turkish-Jewish Relations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the Empire, which was initially undertaken in the [[Greek language]] to the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald&quot;&gt;Donald Quataert, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tughra]] were calligraphic monograms, or signatures, of the Ottoman Sultans, of which there were 35. Carved on the Sultan's seal, they bore the names of the Sultan and his father. The statement and prayer, “ever victorious,” was also present in most. The earliest belonged to Orhan Gazi. The ornately stylized ''Tughra'' spawned a branch of Ottoman-Turkish [[calligraphy]].

===Law===
{{further2|[[Mecelle]]}}
[[Image:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|An Ottoman trial, 1877 (see [[:Image:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|image detail]] for explanation)]]
[[File:Tott-33-Cadi leskier.jpg|thumb|140px|left|A [[kazasker]] or chief judge, 18th century]]
The Ottoman legal system accepted the [[religious law]] over its subjects. The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local [[jurisprudence]]. Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 109-110&quot;&gt;Lauren A. Benton, ''Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400–1900&quot;, pp 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority develop the needs of the local [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 109-110&quot;/&gt; The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 109-110&quot;/&gt; The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the &quot;trade court&quot;. The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Kanun'', i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''Yasa'' and ''Töre'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era. The ''kanun'' law system, on the other hand, was the secular law of the sultan, and dealt with issues not clearly addressed by the ''sharia'' system.

These court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the Islamic courts—which were the Empire's primary courts—could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Hadīth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijmā']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs. Both systems were taught at the Empire's law schools, which were in [[Istanbul]] and [[Bursa]].

Tanzimat reforms drastically affected the law system. In 1877, the [[Private law|civil law]] (except family law) was codified in the [[Mecelle]] code. Later codifications covered commercial law, penal law and civil procedure.

===Military===
{{Main|Military of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[Image:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Chamberlain of Sultan Murad IV with [[janissaries]].]]
[[Image:Ottoman Navy at the Golden Horn.jpg|thumb|A German postcard depicting the [[Ottoman Navy]], led by ''Yavuz'' (ex-''Goeben''). At top left is a portrait of Sultan Mehmed V.]]
The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by [[Osman I]] from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included [[Janissary]], [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Akıncı]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehterân]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)]]. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast [[Turkoman horse|Turkoman]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] horses (progenitors of the [[Thoroughbred#Foundation stallions|Thoroughbred]] racing horse),&lt;ref&gt;Milner ''The Godolphin Arabian'' pp. 3–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall ''Famous Running Horses'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and often applied tactics similar to those of the [[Mongol Empire]], such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The decline in the army's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War. The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice, but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land.

The modernization of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century started with the military. In 1826 Sultan [[Mahmud II]] abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-ı Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the [[Young Turks]] movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.

[[Image:BALKANHARBINDEHARLANTAYYAREMIZ-1912.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Air Force|Ottoman pilots]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913.]]
The [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and [[Egypt]] to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of Algeria (1830) and [[Greece]] (1821), Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (reigned 1861–1876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France. The shipyard at Barrow, England, built its first [[submarine]] in 1886 for the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;first submarine at shipyard&quot;&gt;[http://www.ellesmereportstandard.co.uk/latest-north-west-news/Petition-created-for-submarine-name.4001190.jp Ellesmerereportstandard.co.uk]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}, The standard – Petition created for submarine name&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the collapsing Ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet's strength for too long. Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]], and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]]. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years. Following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] sought to develop a strong Ottoman naval force. The ''Ottoman Navy Foundation'' was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations.

The history of [[Ottoman Air Force|Ottoman military aviation]] dates back to 1909 between June 1909 and July 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkeyswar.com/aviation/aviation.htm |title=Story of Turkish Aviation in 'Turkey in the First World War' website |publisher=Turkeyswar.com |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hv.

The founding of the Aviation School quickened advancement in the military aviation program, increased the number of enlisted persons within it, and gave the new pilots an active role in the [[Ottoman Army]] and [[Ottoman Navy|Navy]]. In May 1913 the world's first specialized Reconnaissance Training Program was started by the Aviation School and the first separate reconnaissance division was established{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. In June 1914 a new military academy, the Naval Aviation School (''Bahriye Tayyare Mektebi'') was founded. With the outbreak of World War I, the modernization process stopped abruptly. The [[Aviation Squadrons (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman aviation squadrons]] fought on many fronts during World War I, from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the west to the [[Caucasus]] in the east and [[Yemen]] in the south.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire}}
The Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire were [[administrative division]]s of the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]]. Outside this system were various types of [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal and tributary states]].

{{Main|Economic history of the Ottoman Empire}}
Ottoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Adrianople and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centres, considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis.&lt;ref name=inalcikstudies209&gt;Halil İnalcık, Studies in the economic history of the Middle East : from the rise of Islam to the present day / edited by M. A. Cook.
London University Press, Oxford U. P. 1970, p. 209 ISBN 0-19-713561-7&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Mehmed and his successor Bayezid, also encouraged and welcomed migration of the Jews from different parts of Europe, who were settled in Istanbul and other port cities like Salonica. In many places in Europe, Jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their Christian counterparts. The tolerance displayed by the Turks was welcomed by the immigrants.

The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.&lt;ref name=inalcikstudies217&gt;Halil İnalcık, Studies in the economic history of the Middle East : from the rise of Islam to the present day / edited by M. A. Cook.
London University Press, Oxford U. P. 1970, p. 217 ISBN 0-19-713561-7&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.

The organization of the treasury and chancery were developed under the Ottoman Empire more than any other Islamic government and, until the 17th century, they were the leading organization among all their contemporaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black p199&quot;&gt;Antony Black (2001), &quot;The state of the House of Osman (devlet-ı al-ı Osman)&quot; in ''The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present'', p.&amp;nbsp;199&lt;/ref&gt; This organization developed a scribal bureaucracy (known as &quot;men of the pen&quot;) as a distinct group, partly highly trained [[ulama]], which developed into a professional body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black p199&quot;/&gt; The effectiveness of this professional financial body stands behind the success of many great Ottoman statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=İnalcık|first1=Halil|last2=Quataert|first2=Donald|title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914|year=1971|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic structure of the Empire was defined by its geopolitical structure. The Ottoman Empire stood between the West and the East, thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire controlled the spice route that [[Marco Polo]] once used. When [[Vasco da Gama]] bypassed Ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with India in 1498, and [[Christopher Columbus]] first journeyed to the Bahamas in 1492, the Ottoman Empire was at its zenith, an economic power that extended over three continents.

Modern Ottoman studies think that the change in relations between the Ottoman Turks and central Europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes. It is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the East as Western Europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the Middle East and Mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the Ottoman Empire itself. The [[Anglo-Ottoman Treaty]], also known as the [[Treaty of Balta Liman]] that opened the Ottoman markets directly to English and French competitors, would be seen as one of the staging posts along this development.

By developing commercial centres and routes, encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions, the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire. But in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant. Within the social and political system they were living in Ottoman administrators could not have comprehended or seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=inalcikstudies218&gt;Halil inalcik, Studies in the economic history of the Middle East : from the rise of Islam to the present day / edited by M.

Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population. For example, the 1831 census only counted men and did not cover the whole empire.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p=281}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Kabadayı&quot;&gt;M. Kabadayı, [http://www.iisg.nl/research/labourcollab/turkey.pdf Inventory for the Ottoman Empire / Turkish Republic 1500–2000]&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier periods estimates of size and distribution of the population are based on observed demographic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;The Ottomans developed an efficient system for counting the empire’s population in 1826, a quarter of a century after such methods were introduced in Britain, France and America – Shaw, S J, “The Ottoman Census System and Population, 1831-1914”, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is unclear why the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Erder and Suraiya Faroqhi, Population Rise and Fall in Anatolia 1550-1620, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Oct., 1979), pp. 322-345&lt;/ref&gt; However, it began to rise to reach 25-32 million by 1800, with around 10 million in the European provinces (primarily the [[Balkans]]), 11 million in the Asiatic provinces and around 3 million in the African provinces. Population densities were higher in the European provinces, double those in Anatolia, which in turn were triple the population densities of Iraq and [[Syria]] and five times the population density of Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Quataert, D, 2000, op cit, pp. 110-11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, the Ottoman population was 18.5 million, similar to that of 1800. Over this time the empire's size was reduced from over 3 million square kilometres to around 1 million square kilometres. This means there was a doubling of population, increasing population densities in the empire. 

Towards the end of the empire's existence [[life expectancy]] was 49 years, compared to the mid-twenties in Serbia at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemic diseases and famine caused major disruption and demographic changes. In 1785 around one sixth of the [[Egypt]]ian population died from plague and Aleppo saw its population reduced by twenty percent in the 18th century. Six famines hit Egypt alone between 1687 and 1731 and the last famine to hit Anatolia was four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought under control in the 19th century with improvements in sanitation, healthcare and transportation of foodstuffs.

The rise of port cities saw the clustering of populations caused by the development of steamships and railroads. Urbanization increased from 1700–1922, with towns and cities growing. Improvements in health and sanitation made them more attractive to live and work in. Port cities like Salonica, in Greece, saw its population rise from 55,000 in 1800 to 160,000 in 1912 and Izmir which had a population of 150,000 in 1800 grew to 300,000 by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 114; Pamuk, S, “The Ottoman Empire and the World Economy: The Nineteenth Century”, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 23, No. 3, Aug. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions conversely had population falls - Belgrade saw its population drop from 25,000 to 8,000 mainly due to political strife.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Population statistics thus mask varying experiences in different regions.

Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire. For example the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees – 200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1783 and 1913, approximately 5-7 million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire, at least 3.8 million of whom were Russians. Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire (e.g. Turkey and Bulgaria) whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories, simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations. Economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans, merchants, manufacturers and agriculturists.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, the exodus to present-day Turkey by the large portion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans.

===Language===
{{main|Languages of the Ottoman Empire}}
Ottoman Turkish was the official language of the Empire. It was a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] highly influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] and Arabic. The Ottomans had three influential languages: Turkish, spoken by the majority of the people in [[Anatolia]] and by the majority of Muslims of the Balkans except in [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia]]; [[Persian language|Persian]], only spoken by the educated;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertold Spuler page 69&quot;&gt;Persian historiography and geography, Bertold Spuler,M. Ismail Marcinkowski, page 69, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and Arabic, spoken mainly in [[Arabia]], North Africa, [[Iraq]], Kuwait and the [[Levant]]. In the last two centuries, usage of these became limited, though, and specific: Persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertold Spuler page 69&quot;/&gt; while [[Arabic]] was used for religious rites.

Because of a low literacy rate among the public (about 2–3% until the early 19th century and just about 15% at the end of 19th century),{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} ordinary people had to hire special &quot;request-writers&quot; (''arzuhâlci''s) to be able to communicate with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=082osLxyBDgC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=arzuhalci#v=onepage&amp;q=arzuhalci&amp;f=false|title=Studies on Ottoman social and political history: selected articles and essays|author=Kemal H. Karpat|publisher=Brill|year=2002|isbn=90-04-12101-3|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic groups continued to speak within their families and neighborhoods ([[mahalle]]s) with their own languages (e.g., Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc.). In villages where two or more populations lived together, the inhabitants would often speak each other's language. In cosmopolitan cities, people often spoke their family languages, many non ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] spoke Turkish as a second language.

====Islam====
{{main|Islam in the Ottoman Empire}}

[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|160px|An unhappy wife is complaining to the [[Qadi]] about her husband's impotence, 18th century.]]
Before adopting Islam (a process that was greatly facilitated by the [[Abbasid]] victory at the 751 [[Battle of Talas]], which ensured Abbasid influence in Central Asia) the Turkic peoples practiced a variety of [[shamanism]]. After this battle, many of the various Turkic tribes—including the [[Oghuz Turks]], who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam, and brought the religion with them to Anatolia beginning in the 11th century.

In 1514, Sultan [[Selim I]], nicknamed “the Grim” because of his cruelty,  ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian [[Shi'ism|Shi'ites]], whom he considered heretics,&lt;ref&gt;George C. Kohn (2007.) ''Dictionary of Wars''. Infobase Publishing. p. 385. ISBN 0-8160-6577-2&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly proclaiming that &quot;the killing of one Shiite had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jalāl Āl Aḥmad, ''Plagued by the West'' (''[[Gharbzadegi]]''), translated by Paul Sprachman. Delmor, NY: Center for Iranian Studies, [[Columbia University]], 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and Judaism====
{{main|Christianity and Judaism in the Ottoman Empire}}
In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim ''[[dhimmi]]'' system, Christians were guaranteed limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were treated as [[second-class citizen]]s. Christians and Jews were not considered equals to Muslims: testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses, their houses could not overlook those of Muslims, and their religious practices would have to defer to those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taner Akcam|Akcam, Taner]]. ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility''. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006 p. 24 ISBN 0-8050-7932-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
The system commonly known as [[devşirme]] (&quot;blood tax&quot;) was effectively used in the Ottoman Empire for centuries: in this system a certain number Christian boys, mainly from the Balkans and Anatolia, were periodically conscripted before they reached adolescence and were brought up as Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw and Shaw. ''History of the Ottoman Empire'', pp. 112–129.&lt;/ref&gt; These selected boys were trained either in the arts of statecraft or in the military to form the ruling class and the elite fighting force, [[Janissaries]], of the empire.
 
The Ottoman Empire was, in principle, tolerant towards Christians and Jews (the &quot;Ahl Al-Kitab&quot;, or &quot;People of the Book&quot;, according to the [[Qur'an]]) but not towards the [[polytheism|polytheists]], according to the [[Sharia law]]. Such tolerance was subject to a non-Muslim tax, the [[Jizya]].

Under the ''millet'' system, non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire, but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law. The Orthodox ''millet'', for instance, was still officially legally subject to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]], which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years. Also, as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects (or ''[[Dhimmi|zimmi]]'') of the Islamic Ottoman state, the Orthodox ''millet'' was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce, and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Krummerich.htm The Divinely-Protected, Well-Flourishing Domain: The Establishment of the Ottoman System in the Balkan Peninsula]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&quot;, Sean Krummerich, [[Loyola University New Orleans]], ''The Student Historical Journal'', volume 30 (1998–99)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/ottoman/turkish.html Turkish Toleration], [[The American Forum for Global Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II allowed the local Christians to stay in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] after conquering the city in 1453, and to retain their institutions such as the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]].

In 1461 Sultan Mehmed II established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Previously, the Byzantines considered the Armenian Church as heretical and thus did not allow them to build churches inside the [[walls of Constantinople]]. In 1492, when the Muslims and [[Sephardic Jews]] were expelled from Spain during the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid II]] sent his fleet under [[Kemal Reis]] to save them and granted the refugees the right to settle in the Ottoman Empire.

The state's relationship with the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] was largely peaceful, and recurrent oppressive measures taken against the Greek church were a deviation from generally established practice. The church's structure was kept intact and largely left alone but under close control and scrutiny until the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1821–1829 and, later in the 19th century, the rise of the Ottoman [[constitutional monarchy]], which was driven to some extent by nationalistic currents, tried to be balanced with [[Ottomanism]]. Other Orthodox churches, like the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], were dissolved and placed under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, until Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] established the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] in 1870 and reinstated the autonomy of the Bulgarian Church.

Similar ''millet''s were established for the Ottoman Jewish community, who were under the authority of the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Haham Başı]]'' or Ottoman [[Chief rabbi|Chief Rabbi]]; the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] community, who were under the authority of a head bishop; and a number of other religious communities as well.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Yeni Cami and Eminönü bazaar, Constantinople, Turkey, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|[[Yeni Cami]] and [[Eminönü]] bazaar, Constantinople, circa 1895]]
The Ottoman Empire had filled roughly the territories around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] while adopting the traditions, art and institutions of cultures in these regions and adding new dimensions to them. As the Ottomans moved further west, the Ottoman leaders absorbed some of the culture of the conquered regions. Intercultural marriages also played their part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture. When compared to the Turkish folk culture, the influence of these new cultures in creating the culture of the Ottoman elite was clear. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of this previous empire (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who elaborated them into new forms and blended them with the characteristics of the ethnic and religious groups living within the Ottoman territories, which resulted in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity.

===Literature===
{{main|Ottoman literature}}
[[File:Nedim (divan edb.şairi).JPG|160px|thumbnail|left|[[Ahmet Nedîm Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]
The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and [[prose]]. Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of [[fiction]]: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[short story]], or [[novel]]. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].

Ottoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير ''mura'ât-i nazîr'' / تناسب ''tenâsüb'') and opposition (تضاد ''tezâd'') were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either ''gazel''s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or ''kasîde''s. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the ''mesnevî'', a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the ''[[Leyli and Majnun]]'' of [[Fuzûlî]] and the ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (حسن و عشق; &quot;Beauty and Love&quot;) of [[Şeyh Gâlib]].

[[File:Evliya Celebi.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Evliya Celebi]], 17th century gentleman adventurer and travel writer]]
Until the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of ''sec''' (سجع, also transliterated as ''seci''), or [[rhymed prose]],&lt;ref&gt;Belge, 389&lt;/ref&gt; a type of writing descended from the Arabic ''[[saj']]'' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was ''Muhayyelât'' (مخيّلات &quot;''Fancies''&quot;) by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867.

Due to historically close ties with [[France]], [[French literature]] came to constitute the major Western influence on Ottoman literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.

Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (انتباه; &quot;Awakening&quot;), while the [[journalist]] [[İbrahim Şinasi]] (1826–1871) is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy &quot;''Şair Evlenmesi''&quot; (شاعر اولنمسى; &quot;The Poet's Marriage&quot;). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled &quot;''Vakâyi`-i `Acibe ve Havâdis-i Garibe-yi Kefşger Ahmed''&quot; (وقایع عجیبه و هوادث غریبۀ کفشگر احمد; &quot;The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed&quot;), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] (1844–1912) wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (حسن ملاح ياخود سر ايچيكده اسرار ''Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr'', 1873; &quot;''Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery''&quot;), Realism (هﻨﻮز اون يدى يشکده ''Henüz On Yedi Yaşında'', 1881; &quot;''Just Seventeen Years Old''&quot;), and Naturalism (مشاهدات ''Müşâhedât'', 1891; &quot;''Observations''&quot;). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{main|Ottoman architecture}}
[[File:Visegrad Drina Bridge 1.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture.]]
[[Image:Safranbolu traditional houses.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Safranbolu]] was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1994 due to its well-preserved Ottoman residential architecture.]]
[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]], [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures.  During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] the early or first Ottoman architecture period, Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire become the classical period of architecture, when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.

During the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture mainly circle the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]] and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s and tombs.

Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul and [[Edirne]], can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences: such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=Eli Shah. The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorative arts===
[[File:Levni 16 Young Woman, Sleeping Beauty.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Abdulcelil Levni]], early 18th century]]
The tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted toto illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'' was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.

[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In [[Topkapi Palace]], these manuscripts were created by the artists working in [[Nakkashane]], the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.

The art of [[carpet]] [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.&lt;ref name=foroqhi&gt;Foroqhi, S. ''Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire'', I. B. Tauris, 2005, ISBN 1-85043-760-2, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The weaving of such carpets originated in the [[nomad]]ic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily-transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.&lt;ref name=foroqhip153&gt;Foroqhi, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance arts===
[[File:Karagoz figures.jpg|thumb|left|The shadow play [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire]]
[[File:Surname 171b.jpg|thumb|160px|Miniature from &quot;Surname-i Vehbi&quot; showing the [[Mehteran]], the music band of the Janissaries.]]
[[Ottoman classical music]] was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite, a number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.

The [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|bağlama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanún|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and—later in the tradition—Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music, and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian Türküs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) Türküs, Aegean Türküs, Central Anatolian Türküs, Eastern Anatolian Türküs, and Caucasian Türküs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].

The traditional shadow play called [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |title=Allaboutturkey |publisher=Allaboutturkey |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emin Şenyer: [http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm Karagoz Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by tambourine (''def''). Its origins are obscure, deriving perhaps from an older [[Egypt]]ian tradition, or possibly from an Asian source.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Ottoman cuisine}}
[[File:PZ 6763 Cook in the rue de Stamboul, Constantinople, Turkey, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Cook on a street in Istanbul, 1890s]]
[[Ottoman cuisine]] refers to the cuisine of the capital—[[Istanbul]], and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that all the populations enjoyed. This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yalı]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population. Today, Ottoman cuisine lives in the Balkans, [[Anatolia]] and the Middle East, &quot;common heirs to what was once the Ottoman life-style, and their cuisines offer treacherous circumstantial evidence of this fact&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fragner&gt;Bert Fragner, &quot;From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure&quot;, in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London and New York, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical of any great cuisine in the world to be based on local varieties and on mutual exchange and enrichment among them, but at the same time to be homogenized and harmonized by a metropolitan tradition of refined taste.&lt;ref name=Fragner/&gt;

===Society===
[[Image:Meddah story teller.png|thumb|180px|Story teller at a [[coffeehouse]]]]
The [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]] were the major religious groups that were allowed to retain their own religious laws, traditions, and language under the general protection of the sultan. As early as the reign of Mehmed II, extensive rights were granted to [[Phanariotes|Phanariot Greeks]], and [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Jews]] were invited to settle in Ottoman territory. This non-assimilative policy became a weakness after the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]].

The [[lifestyle of the Ottoman Empire]] was fragmented, as the millet concept enabled many to coexist in a [[mosaic]] of cultures. The culture that evolved around the Ottoman court was known as the [[Ottoman Way]], which was epitomized with the Topkapı Palace. There were also large metropolitan centers where the Ottoman influence expressed itself with a diversity similar to metropolises of today: [[Sarajevo]], [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Dimashq]], Baghdad, [[Beirut]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Makkah]] and [[Algiers]] with their own small versions of Ottoman Provincial Administration replicating the culture of the Ottoman court locally.

[[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|Slavery]] was a part of Ottoman society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=Supply of Slaves |publisher=Coursesa.matrix.msu.edu |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1908 women slaves were still sold in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml |title=Islam and slavery: Sexual slavery |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the [[slave trade]] but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, 37 larger and smaller plague epidemics were recorded in Istanbul, and 31 between 1751 and 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Université de Strasbourg.

==Science and technology==
{{main|Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}
The Ottomans managed to build a very large collection of libraries. Sultan [[Mehmet II]] ordered [[Georgios Amirutzes]], a Greek scholar from [[Trabzon]], to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of [[Ptolemy]]. One of the oldest sources on the history and philosophy of Christianity was also developed for the palace school: the ''İ'tikad nâme'', a work on Christian beliefs by [[Patriarch Gennadious]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Another example is mathematician [[Ali Qushji]] from [[Samarkand]], who wrote twelve volumes on mathematics.

[[Ali Kuşçu]] (1403–1474) found empirical evidence for the [[Earth's rotation]] through his observation on [[comet]]s and concluded, on the basis of [[empiricism]] rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory.&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;{{Harv|Ragep|2001a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

Kuşçu also improved on [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]]'s planetary model and presented an alternative planetary model for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]], &quot;Arabic planetary theories after the eleventh century AD&quot;, in Rushdī Rāshid and Régis Morelon (1996), ''Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science'', p. 58-127 [123-124], [[Routledge]], ISBN 0415124107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taqi al-Din]] later built the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] in 1577, where he carried out astronomical observations until 1580. He calculated the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the Sun's orbit and the annual motion of the [[apogee]].&lt;ref name=Tekeli&gt;Sevim Tekeli, &quot;Taqi al-Din&quot;, in Helaine Selin (1997), ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], ISBN 0792340663.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu]] was the author of the first surgical atlas and the last major [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medical encyclopedia from the Islamic world]]. Though his work was largely based on [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]]'s ''[[Al-Tasrif]]'', Sabuncuoğlu introduced many innovations of his own. Female surgeons were also illustrated for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bademci (2006), &quot;First illustrations of female Neurosurgeons in the fifteenth century by Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu&quot;, ''Neurocirugía'' '''17''': 162-5&lt;/ref&gt;
