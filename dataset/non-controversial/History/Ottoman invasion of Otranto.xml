In 1480 and 1481 the '''city and fort of [[Otranto]]''', in [[Apulia]], southern [[Italy]], were held by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops.

==Attack==
On July 28, 1480, an Ottoman fleet of 128 ships of which 28 were [[galley]]s arrived near the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] city of Otranto in the region [[Apulia]].  Possibly these troops came from the [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|siege of Rhodes]]. On July 29 the [[garrison]] and the citizens retreated to the [[citadel]], the Castle of Otranto.  On 11 August this was taken by the invaders.

According to Christian historiography a [[Raid (military)|raid]] was held to round up all male citizens. [[Archbishop]] Stefano Agricoli and others were killed in the cathedral, while Bishop Stephen Pendinelli and the garrison commander, count Francesco Zurlo, were sawed in two alive. On August 12, 800 citizens who refused to convert to [[Islam]] were taken to the Hill of the Minerva and beheaded.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web

The cathedral is said to have been used as a stable after that.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--The Ottomans usually didn't do this, considering their rule in other Christian areas, such as Greece--&gt;

This version has come under severe criticism. From the Turkish side it is disputed that large-scale executions took place; the bones to be found in the Cathedral of Otranto are claimed to be actually those of fighters killed during the Turkish invasion. Italian researchers, on the other hand, conclude that some acts of terror were committed by the Turkish invaders to create panic among the Italians around Otranto.

In August, 70 ships of the fleet attacked [[Vieste]]. On September 12, the Monastero di San Nicholas di Casole, which accommodated one of the richer libraries of Europe, was destroyed. In October 1480, the coastal cities of [[Lecce]], [[Taranto]] and [[Brindisi]] were attacked.

Because of lack of food [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] returned with most of his troops to [[Albania]], leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto. It was assumed he would return after the winter.

==Response==
Since it was only 28 years after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall of Constantinople]], there was some fear that [[Rome]] would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] repeated his 1471 call for a [[crusade]]. Several Italian city-states, Hungary and France responded positively to this. The [[Republic of Venice]] did not, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.

In 1481 an army was raised by king [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] to be led by his son [[Alphonso II of Naples]]. A contingent of troops was provided by king [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]].

==Counterattack==
The city was besieged starting May 1, 1481. On May 3 the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Mehmed II]], died, with ensuing quarrels about his succession. This possibly prevented the sending of Ottoman reinforcements to Otranto. So in the end the Turkish occupation of Otranto ended by negotiation with the Christian forces, permitting the Turks to withdraw to Albania. However, quite a few of them were still taken captives when the Christian troops occupied Otranto again.

==Aftermath==
The number of citizens, said to have been about 20,000 (a figure very much disputed by recent research), had decreased to 8,000{{Citation needed|extent needed=1. sources for &quot;said to&quot; and 2. sources for &quot;disputed by recent research&quot;|date=October 2011}}. Out of fear of another attack, many of these left the city.
