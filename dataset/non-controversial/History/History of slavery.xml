{{Slavery}}

The '''history of slavery''' covers slave systems in historical perspective in which one human being is legally the property of another, can be bought or sold, is not allowed to escape and must work for the owner without any choice involved. As Drescher (2009) argues, &quot;The most crucial and frequently utilized aspect of the condition is a communally recognized right by some individuals to possess, buy, sell, discipline, transport, liberate, or otherwise dispose of the bodies and behavior of other individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (2009) pp 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; An integral element is that children of a [[slave]] mother automatically become slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman, &quot;Laws&quot; in Finkelman and Miller, eds, ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'' (1998) 2:477-8&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include historical [[penal labor|forced labor by prisoners]], [[labor camps]], or other forms of [[unfree labor]] in which laborers are not considered property.

Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1760&amp;nbsp;BC), which refers to it as an established institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title= Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|quote=e.g. Prologue, &quot;the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves&quot;
Code of Laws No. 7, &quot;If any one buy from the son or the slave of another man&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery is rare among [[hunter-gatherer]] populations as slavery depends on a system of [[social stratification]]. Slavery typically also requires a shortage of labor and a surplus of land to be viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Britannica|title=Slavery|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; David P.

==Origins==
{{Main|Slavery in antiquity}}
[[File:Slave treaty tablet.jpg|thumb|200px|C. 1480 BC, fugitive slave treaty between Idrimi of Alakakh (now [[Tell Atchana]]) and Pillia of [[Kizzuwatna]] (now Cilicia).]]
Evidence of slavery predates written records, and has existed in many cultures.&lt;ref name=Slavery&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies]&quot;. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery is rare among [[hunter–gatherer]] populations, as slavery is a system of social stratification. Mass slavery also requires economic surpluses and a high population density to be viable. Due to these factors, the practice of slavery would have only proliferated after the invention of agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt;

Slavery was known in civilizations as old as [[Sumer]], as well as almost every other ancient civilization, including [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient China]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyria]], [[Bronze Age India|Ancient India]], [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], the Islamic [[Caliphate]], and the [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian civilizations]] of the Americas.&lt;ref name=Slavery/&gt; Such institutions were a mixture of [[debt bondage|debt-slavery]], punishment for crime, the enslavement of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], [[child abandonment]], and the birth of slave children to slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Demography, Geography and the Sources of Roman Slaves, by W. V. Harris: The Journal of Roman Studies, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient times===
The earliest records of slavery can be traced to the  oldest known records, which treat it as an established institution, not one newly instituted.  The Sumerian [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (c. 2100 BC – 2050 BC), the oldest known tablet containing a law code surviving to today, contains laws regarding to slaves. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1760 BC), for example, stated that death was prescribed for anyone who helped a slave to escape, as well as for anyone who sheltered a fugitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title= Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|quote=e.g. Prologue, &quot;the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves&quot;. Code of Laws No. 7, &quot;If any one buy from the son or the slave of another man&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bible refers to slavery as an established institution.&lt;ref name=Slavery/&gt; [[Hittites|Hittite]] texts from Anatolia include laws regulating the institution of slavery.

In Egypt, private ownership of slaves, captured in war and given by the king to their captor, certainly occurred at the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (1550 – 1295 BC). Sales of slaves occurred in the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] (732 – 656 BC), and contracts of servitude survive from the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] (c. 672 – 525 BC) and from the reign of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]: apparently such a contract then required the consent of the slave.

The medieval scholar and traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] states several times that he was given or purchased slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab slave trade]] is thought to have originated with trans-Saharan slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.edu/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Twelve.html Battuta's Trip: Journey to West Africa (1351–1353)] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphmag.org/BU/slavery.html |title=Slavery in the Sahara |publisher=Ralphmag.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab, Indian, Somali and Asian traders were involved in the capture and transport of slaves northward across the [[Sahara]] desert and the Indian Ocean region into [[Arabia]] and the Middle East, [[Persia]], [[Somalia]], Central Asia and the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A6645-2004Jan10&amp;notFound=true |title=A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight |work=The Washington Post  |date=11 January 2004 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Arab Slave Trade&quot;/&gt; The slave trade from East Africa to [[Arabia]] was dominated by Arab and Somali traders in the coastal cities of [[Zanzibar]], [[Dar Es Salaam]] and [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arab Slave Trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabslavetrade.com|publisher=&quot;[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]]&quot;|title=Slavery in Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flh.tmu.ac.ir/hoseini/safavid/articles-1/49.pdf Slaves And Slave Trading In Shi’i Iran, AD 1500-1900] by Thomas Ricks, Center for Arab and Islamic Studies, Villanova University.&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of black [[Zanj]] slaves were imported to lower [[Iraq]], where they may have, according to Richard Hellie, constituted at least a half of the total population there in the 9th and 10th centuries.

In 1400 [[Timur|Tamerlane]] [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|invaded]] the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and its fief [[Armenia]]. More than 60,000 [[Peoples of the Caucasus|people from the Caucasus]] were captured as slaves, and many districts of Armenia were depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |title=The Turco-Mongol Invasions |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1569 the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] suffered a series of [[Tatar invasions]], the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture slaves into ''[[jasyr]]''. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly [[Ukrainians]] but also [[Circassians]], [[Russians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Poles]] and Jews were captured and enslaved during the time of the [[Crimean Khanate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldier Khan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2005/04/the_living_legacy_of_jihad_sla.html |title=The living legacy of jihad slavery |publisher=Americanthinker.com |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian conquest of the Crimea led to the abolition of slavery by the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e91230n234h41020/ Slave trade in the early modern Crimea from the perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was an important part of Ottoman society.&lt;ref&gt;Ehud R. Toledano, ''As If Silent and Absent: Bonds of Enslavement around the Islamic Middle East'' (Yale University Press, 2007) ISBN 978-0-300-12618-1&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Constantinople]] (today [[Istanbul]]), about 1/5 of the population consisted of slaves.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica-24157&quot;/&gt; As late as 1908 women slaves were still sold in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml |title=Islam and slavery: Sexual slavery |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 14th century, [[Murad I]] built his own personal slave army called the ''Kapıkulu''. The new force was based on the sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to Islam and trained in the sultan's personal service. In the ''[[devşirme]]'' (Turkish for 'gathering'), young Christian boys from the [[Balkans]] were taken away from their homes and families, converted to Islam and enlisted into special soldier classes of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] or the civil service. These soldier classes were named [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the most famous branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. The Janissaries eventually became a decisive factor in the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasions of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=266205 |title=Janissary |publisher=Everything2.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators and ''de facto'' rulers of the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |title=Lewis.

The increased numbers of janissaries came from Muslim peasants who were now allowed into service as a result of increased military demands of 17th-century warfare.

The [[Mamluks]] were [[slave]] soldiers who converted to Islam and served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]], and on more than one occasion they seized power for themselves, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] in the years 1250–1517. From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] Turk origin. [[White people|White]] slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corps of troops eventually revolting in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. Mamluks were mainly responsible for the expulsion of the [[Crusade]]rs from [[Palestine]] and preventing the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |publisher=Sunnahonline.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1.25 million [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] were captured by [[Barbary pirates]] and sold as slaves in North Africa and [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://krypta.i24.cc/saint.php?dir=slavesI&amp;rtn=saint.php?dir=unknown The Crypt: Slaves in the Islamic world]&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal villages and towns of Italy, Portugal, Spain and [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] were frequently attacked by them and long stretches of the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants; after 1600 Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic and [[Turkish Abductions|struck as far north]] as [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2a1_1187537365 |title=White slaves.

In Portugal for instance, the coastal city of [[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]] was raided several times during until the 16th century when the local fortress was built (according to Pedro Penteado and his book based in the historical ecclesiastic diaries of Nazaré). The city of Lisbon built the [[Torre de Belém]] to defend the capital against these pirates.

Between 1609 and 1616 England alone had a staggering 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates. 160 English ships were captured by Algerians between 1677 and 1680.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Slaves on the Barbary Coast&quot;&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml British Slaves on the Barbary Coast], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Slave-taking persisted into the 19th century when Barbary pirates would capture ships and enslave the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Hitchens |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007 |publisher=City-journal.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the United States was not immune.

Among the most important slave markets where [[Pirate]]s operated in [[Mediterranean Europe]] were the ports of [[Majorca]], [[Toulon]], [[Marseille]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Livorno]] and [[Malta]].

Slavery in India is evidenced since ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein&quot;&gt;B. Stein, D. Arnold. ''A History of India'', page 212 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0K3GZfqCabsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burton+Stein%27s+History+of+India#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery&amp;f=false]. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, 444 pages. ISBN 1-4051-9509-6&lt;/ref&gt; Manu the Lawgiver, in his ''Manu Smriti'' lists seven different kinds of slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein&quot;/&gt; The nature of slavery in India was extremely complex and cut across boundaries of caste, gender, kin, religion, and role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein&quot;/&gt;

The early [[Muslim conquests|Arab invaders of Sind]] in the 8th century, the armies of the Umayyad commander [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], are reported to have enslaved tens of thousands of Indian prisoners, including both soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, tr., The Chachnamah, an Ancient History of Sind, 1900, reprint (Delhi, 1979), pp. 154, 163. This thirteenth-century source claims to be a Persian translation of an (apparently lost) eighth-century Arabic manuscript detailing the Islamic conquests of Sind.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, Seventh to Eleventh Centuries (Leiden, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 11th century Tarikh al-Yamini, the Arab historian Al-Utbi recorded that in 1001 the armies of [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] conquered [[Peshawar]] and [[Waihand]] (capital of Gandhara) after [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Battle of Peshawar]] (1001), &quot;in the midst of the land of [[Hindustan]]&quot;, and captured some 100,000 youths.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Qasim Firishta, Tarikh-i-Firishta (Lucknow, 1864).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 2, The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest, 11th–13th centuries (Leiden, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following his twelfth expedition into India in 1018–19, Mahmud is reported to have returned with such a large number of slaves that their value was reduced to only two to ten dirhams each. This unusually low price made, according to Al-Utbi, &quot;merchants [come] from distant cities to purchase them, so that the countries of Central Asia, Iraq and Khurasan were swelled with them, and the fair and the dark, the rich and the poor, mingled in one common slavery&quot;. Elliot and Dowson refers to &quot;five hundred thousand slaves, beautiful men and women.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Utbi, Tarikh al-Yamini (Delhi, 1847), tr. by James Reynolds, The Kitab-i-Yamini (London, 1858),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wink, Al-Hind, II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry M. Elliot and John Dowson, History of India as told by its own Historians, 8 vols (London, 1867–77), II,&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] period (1206–1555), references to the abundant availability of low-priced Indian slaves abound. Levi attributes this primarily to the vast human resources of India, compared to its neighbours to the north and west (Mughal Indian population being approximately 12 to 20 times that of Turan and Iran at the end of the 16th century) .&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Indian Merchants,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab slave trade]]rs also brought slaves as early as the 1st century AD from Africa. Most of the African slaves were brought, however, in the 17th century and were taken into Western India. The [[Siddi]] people are of mainly East African descent.

Much of the northern and central parts of the subcontinent was ruled by the so-called [[Slave Dynasty]] of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin from 1206 to 1290: [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]], a slave of [[Muhammad Ghori]] rose to power following his master's death. For almost a century, his descendants ruled presiding over the introduction of Tankas and building of [[Qutub Minar]].

According to Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 slaves in India in 1841. In [[Malabar District|Malabar]], about 15% of the population were slaves. Slavery was officially abolished in India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843. Provisions of the [[Indian Penal Code]] of 1861 effectively abolished slavery in India by making the enslavement of human beings a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-24160 |title=Slavery :: Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/english/pubs/pdf/occpaper/OCP-07.pdf Islamic Law and the Colonial Encounter in dumb ass British India] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=40A67F228E2C056228208BC3FD05D1C0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=126588 |title=Hindus Beyond the fucking Hindu Kush: Indians in the Central Asian Slave Trade |doi=10.1017/S1356186302000329 |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
:&quot;The country generally between Caubul ([[Kabul]]) and the [[Oxus]] appears to be in a very lawless state; slavery is as rife as ever, and extends through [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], [[Badakshan]], [[Wakhan]], [[Sirikul]], Kunjūt ([[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]]), &amp;c. A slave, if a strong man likely to stand work well, is, in Upper Badakshan, considered to be of the same value as one of the large dogs of the country, or of a horse, being about the equivalent of Rs 80. A slave girl is valued at from four horses or more, according to her looks &amp;c.; men are, however, almost always exchanged for dogs. When I was in Little Tibet ([[Ladakh]]), a returned slave who had been in the [[Kashmir]] army took refuge in my camp; he said he was well enough treated as to food &amp;c., but he could never get over having been exchanged for a dog, and constantly harped on the subject, the man who sold him evidently thinking the dog the better animal of the two. In Lower Badakshan, and more distant places, the price of slaves is much enhanced, and payment is made in coin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Report of &quot;The Mary's&quot; Exploration from Caubul to Kashgar.&quot; T.

In response to the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] uprising of 1892, the Afghan Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] declared a &quot;[[Jihad]]&quot; against the Shiites. His large army defeated the rebellion at its center, in [[Oruzgan]], by 1892 and the local population was being massacred. According to S. A. Mousavi, ''&quot;thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir&quot;''.

===China===
{{Main|Slavery in China}}
Slavery throughout pre-modern Chinese history has repeatedly come in and out of favor. Due to the enormous population and relatively high development of the region throughout most of its history, China has always had a large workforce.

Historically, Chinese families customarily had an average of four children or more. This custom was well suited to the [[agrarian]] societies of the period. In times of hardship such as widespread famine or severe financial difficulty, parents of poor families sold some of their children to wealthy homes, to be treated as future brides, servants or slaves. This depended on the compassion and good grace of the master. However, more often it was teenagers or young adults who turned themselves in to become servants. They were not technically slaves since they received periodic payments, which they usually sent home to their families.

====Qing Dynasty====
{{Main|Booi Aha}}
In the 17th century [[Qing Dynasty]], there was a hereditarily servile people called ''Booi Aha'' (Manchu:booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: 包衣阿哈), which is a Manchu word literally translated as &quot;household person&quot; and sometimes rendered as &quot;[[nucai]]&quot; or &quot;slaves&quot;.

In his book ''China Marches West'', Peter C. Perdue stated:&quot;In 1624(After [[Nurhachi]]'s invasion of [[Liaodong]]) &quot;Chinese households....while those with less were made into slaves.&quot; The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhachi said:&quot; The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Chinese Civilization&lt;/ref&gt; Perdue further pointed out that booi aha &quot;did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of &quot;bondservant-slave&quot; (Chinese:奴僕); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate &quot;booi&quot; as &quot;bondservant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Perdue|first= Peter |title=China Marches West |publisher=# Publisher: Triliteral |date= Pub.

# ''booi niru'' a Manchu word (Chinese:包衣佐領), meaning Neiwufu Upper Three Banner's platoon leader of about 300 men .
# ''Booi guanlin'' a Manchu word (Chinese:包衣管領), meaning the manager of ''booi'' doing all the domestic duties of Neiwufu.
# ''Booi amban'' is also a Manchu word, meaning high official, (Chinese:包衣大臣).
# ''Estate bannerman'' (Chinese:庄头旗人) are those renegade Chinese who joined the Jurchen, or original civilians-soldiers working in the fields. These people were all turned into ''booi aha'', or field slaves.

Here are two accounts of slavery given by two Westerners in the late 19th century and early 20th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;In the houses of wealthy citizens, it is not unusual to find twenty to thirty slaves attending upon a family. Even citizens in the humbler walks of life deem it necessary to have each a slave or two. The price of a slave varies, of course, according to age, health, strength, and general appearance. The average price is from fifty to one hundred dollars, but in time of war, or revolution, poor parents, on the verge of starvation, offer their sons and daughters for sale at remarkably low prices. I remember instances of parents, rendered destitute by the marauding bands who invested the two southern ''Kwangs'' in 1854–55, offering to sell their daughters in Canton for five dollars apiece. . . .

The slavery to which these unfortunate persons are subject, is perpetual and hereditary, and they have no parental authority over their offspring. The great-grandsons of slaves, however, can, if they have sufficient means, purchase their freedom. . . .

Masters seem to have the same uncontrolled power over their slaves that parents have over their children. Thus a master is not called to account for the death of a slave, although it is the result of punishment inflicted by him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John Henry. (1878). ''China: A History of the Laws, Manners and Customs of the People'', pp. 241–243. Reprint: Dover Publications, Mineola, New York. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;In former times slaves were slain and offered in sacrifice to the spirit of the owner when dead, or by him to his ancestors: sometimes given as a substitute to suffer the death penalty incurred by his owner or in fulfilment of a vow. It used to be customary in Kuei-chou (and Szü-chuan too, I believe) to inter living slaves with their dead owners; the slaves were to keep a lamp burning in the tomb....

&quot;Slavery exists in China, especially in Canton and Peking.... It is a common thing for well-to-do people to present a couple of slave girls to a daughter as part of her marriage dowery [sic]. Nearly all prostitutes are slaves. It is, however, customary with respectable people to release their slave girls when marriageable. Some people sell their slave girls to men wanting a wife for themselves or for a son of theirs.

&quot;I have bought three different girls: two in Szü-chuan for a few taels each, less than fifteen dollars. One I released in Tientsin, another died in Hongkong; the other I gave in marriage to a faithful servant of mine. Some are worth much money at Shanghai.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mesny]]. (13 May 1905). ''Mesny's Miscellany'', Vol IV, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern times====
All forms of slavery have been illegal in China since 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Commemoration of the Abolition of Slavery Project&lt;/ref&gt; although the practice still exists through illegal trafficking in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese Police Find Child Slaves.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{Main|Slavery in Japan}}

Slavery in Japan was, for most of its history, indigenous, since the export and import of slaves was restricted by Japan being a group of islands. However, Koreans were shipped to Japan as slaves during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henny Savenije |url=http://www.cartography.henny-savenije.pe.kr/ |title=Korea through western cartographic eyes |publisher=Cartography.henny-savenije.pe.kr |date=14 August 2002 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samurai-archives.com/hak.html |title=Hideyoshi and Korea |publisher=Samurai-archives.com |date=25 April 2003 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The export of a slave from Japan is recorded in a 3rd-century Chinese document, although the system involved is unclear. These people were called {{Nihongo|''seiko''|生口}}, lit. &quot;living mouth&quot;. &quot;Seiko&quot; from historical theories are thought to be as prisoner, slave, a person who has technical skill and also students studying abroad to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wikipedia |url=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/生口 |title=生口}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 8th century, a slave was called {{Nihongo|''nuhi''|奴婢}} and a series of laws on slavery was issued. In an area of present-day [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], out of a population of 190,000, around 2,000 were slaves; the proportion is believed to have been even higher in western Japan.

Slavery persisted into the [[Sengoku period]] (1467–1615), but the attitude that slavery was anachronistic had become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nelson, &quot;Slavery in Medieval Japan,&quot; ''Monumenta Nipponica'' 2004 59(4): 463–492&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oda Nobunaga]] is said to have had an African slave or former-slave in his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, Gary P.

In late-16th-century Japan, slavery was officially banned; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor. Somewhat later, the Edo period penal laws prescribed &quot;non-free labor&quot; for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003).

====World War II====
As the [[Empire of Japan]] annexed Asian countries, from the late 19th century onwards, archaic institutions including slavery were abolished in those countries. However, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese military used millions of civilians and [[prisoners of war]] as forced labor, on projects such as the [[Burma Railway]].

According to a joint study by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo and [[Mark Peattie]], more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the ''[[East Asia Development Board|Kōa-in]]'' (Japanese Asia Development Board) for forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/minutes_2002.htm |title=Japan's Atrocities of Conscripting and Abusing North China Draftees after the Outbreak of the Pacific War |author=Ju Zhifen |year=2002 |work=Joint study of the Sino-Japanese war }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Japanese military's own record, nearly 25% of 140,000 Allied [[POWs]] died while interned in Japanese prison camps where they were forced to work (U.S. POWs died at a rate of 37%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/jp/book/115 How Japanese companies built fortunes on American POWs] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_atrocities.html |title=Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines |publisher=Pbs.org |date=14 December 1944 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the [[Death Railway|Burma-Siam Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/links.html |title=Links for research, Allied POWs under the Japanese |publisher=Mansell.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in [[Java (island)|Java]], between 4 and 10 million ''[[romusha]]'' (Japanese: &quot;manual laborer&quot;), were forced to work by the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, &quot;Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45&quot;] Access date: 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%.

Approximately 5,400,000 [[Koreans]] were conscripted from 1939 to 1945. About 670,000 of them were taken to Japan, where about 60,000 died between 1939 and 1945 due mostly to exhaustion or poor working conditions. Many of those taken to [[Karafuto Prefecture]] (modern-day [[Sakhalin]]) were trapped there at the end of the war, stripped of their nationality and denied repatriation by Japan; they became known as the [[Sakhalin Koreans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lankov&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|publisher=The Korea Times|date=5 January 2006|accessdate=26 November 2006|title=Stateless in Sakhalin|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200601/kt2006010516434554130.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total deaths of Korean forced laborers in Korea and [[Manchuria]] for those years is estimated to be between 270,000 and 810,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=R.

===Korea===
Indigenous slaves existed in [[Korea]]. Slavery was officially abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894 but remained extant in reality until 1930. During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910), Korea was a hierarchical society, and slaves accounted for 30 to 40 percent of society as well as half of the population in the capital. The lowest classes in Korea were the [[Cheonmin]], which included slaves called [[Nobi]]. Low status was hereditary, but members of higher classes could be reduced to Cheonmin as a form of legal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/03.22/35-mm.html Edward Willett Wagner – The Harvard University Gazette]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During poor harvests and [[famine]], many peasants would voluntarily sell themselves into slavery in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-693609/history-of-Korea |title=Korea, history pre-1945: slavery – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Young-hoon Rhee &amp; Donghyu Yang |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/snu/ioerwp/no26.html |title=Korean Nobi |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muninn.net/blog/2005/04/nobi-rescuing-the-nation-from-slavery.html |title=Nobi: Rescuing the Nation from Slavery |publisher=Muninn.net |date=7 April 2005 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cheonmin were looked down upon in Korean society; however, they could have private property, while slaves could not own private property. Unless freed by their masters, slaves were never able to move into a higher class.

There was a large slave class in [[Khmer Empire]] who built the enduring monuments in [[Angkor Wat]] and did most of the heavy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.mongabay.com/cambodia/angkorwat.htm |title=Cambodia Angkor Wat |publisher=Travel.mongabay.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves had been taken captive from the mountain tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.msu.edu/seasia/Cambodia/history.html Windows on Asia] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; People unable to pay back a [[debt bondage|debt]] to the upper ruling class could be sentenced to work as a slave too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambodia-travel.com/khmer/society.htm |title=Khmer Society – Angkor Wat |publisher=Cambodia-travel.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 17th and the early 20th centuries one-quarter to one-third of the population of some areas of [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Slavery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Siam]] (Thailand), the [[POW|war captives]] became the property of the king. During the reign of [[Rama III]] (1824–1851), there were an estimated 46,000 war slaves. Slaves from independent hill populations were ''&quot;hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese, the Anamites, and the Cambodians&quot;'' (Colquhoun 1885:53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery4.htm |title=Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Northern Thailand |publisher=Kyotoreviewsea.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not abolished in Siam until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=213 |title=The Kingdom of Ayutthaya |publisher=Thailandsworld.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yi people]] in Yunnan practiced a complicated form of slavery. People were split into the Black Yi (nobles, 7% of the population), White Yi (commoners), Ajia (33% of the Yi population) and the Xiaxi (10%). Ajia and Xiaxi were slave castes. The White Yi were not slaves but had no freedom of movement. The Black Yi were famous for their slave-raids on [[Han Chinese]] communities. After 1959 some 700,000 slaves were freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istp.murdoch.edu.au/ISTP/casestudies/Case_Studies_Asia/tour_yi/tour_yi.html |title=The Yi Nationality |publisher=Istp.murdoch.edu.au |date=3 October 1999 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yi.peoples.org/learn/profiles/general.htm General Profile of the Yi] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-yi.htm |title=The Yi ethnic minority |publisher=China.org.cn |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves in [[Toraja]] society in [[Indonesia]] were family property. Sometimes Torajans decided to become slaves when they incurred a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Torajan slaves were sold and shipped out to [[Java]] and [[Siam]]. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime [[capital punishment|punishable by death]]. Slavery was [[abolitionism|abolished]] in 1863 in all Dutch colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stampslandia.webng.com/gallery2/niz/niz_old.htm |title=Stamps |publisher=Stamslandia.webng.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/East-Southeast-Asia/Toraja-History-and-Cultural-Relations.html |title=Toraja History and Cultural Relations |publisher=Everyculture.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimean Khanate===

In the time of the [[Crimean Khanate]], Crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the [[Danubian principalities]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], and [[Muscovy]]. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savğa) of 10% or 20%. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into &quot;sefers&quot;, officially declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and ''çapuls'', raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers). For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive [[Slave Trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. [[Caffa]] was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Historical survey &gt; Slave societies]&lt;/ref&gt; Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved more than 1 million Eastern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Galina I.

===Ancient Greece===
{{See also|Slavery in ancient Greece}}
Records of [[slavery in Ancient Greece]] go as far back as [[Mycenaean Greece]]. The origins are not known, but it appears that slavery became an important part of the economy and society only after the establishment of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Cuffel, &quot;The Classical Greek Concept of Slavery,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul. – Sep. 1966), pp.&amp;nbsp;323–342 {{jstor|2708589}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] was common practice and an integral component of [[ancient Greece]] throughout its rich history, as it was in other societies of the time including ancient Israel and early Christian societies.&lt;ref&gt;John Byron, ''Slavery Metaphors in Early Judaism and Pauline Christianity: A Traditio-historical and Exegetical Examination'', Mohr Siebeck, 2003, ISBN 3-16-148079-1, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland De Vaux, John McHugh, ''Ancient Israel: Its Life and Institutions'', Wm.

Eerdmans Publishing, 1997, ISBN 0-8028-4278-X, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;J.M.Roberts, ''The New Penguin History of the World'', p.176–177, 223&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in [[Athens]], the majority of [[polis|citizens]] owned at least one slave. Most ancient writers considered slavery not only natural but necessary, but some isolated debate began to appear, notably in [[Socratic dialogues]] while the Stoics produced the first condemnation of slavery recorded in history.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

During the 8th and the 7th centuries BC, in the course of the two [[Messenian Wars]] the [[Sparta]]ns reduced an entire population to a pseudo-slavery called ''[[helots|helotry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/sparta/a/spartamilitstat.htm |title=Sparta – A Military City-State |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodotus]] (IX, 28–29), helots were seven times as numerous as Spartans. Following several helot revolts around the year 600 BC, the Spartans restructured their city-state along authoritarian lines, for the leaders decided that only by turning their society into an armed camp could they hope to maintain control over the numerically dominant helot population.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Martin, ''Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times'' (Yale UP, 2000) pp. 66, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Ancient Greek]] city states about 30% of the population consisted of slaves, but paid and slave labor seem to have been equally important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ancient Greece|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1741501460_4/Ancient_Greece.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqwnRA9|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans inherited the institution of slavery from the [[Greeks]] and the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Slavery&quot; ''The Encyclopedia Americana'', 1981, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Roman Republic]] expanded outward, entire populations were enslaved, thus creating an ample supply to work in [[Farming in Ancient Rome|Rome's farms]] and households. The people subjected to [[Roman slavery]] came from all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Such oppression by an elite minority eventually led to [[slave revolts]]; the [[Third Servile War]] led by [[Spartacus]] was the most famous and severe. Greeks, [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Germanic peoples|Germans]], [[Brython|Britons]], [[Slavs]], [[Thracians]], [[Gauls]] (or [[Celts]]), Jews, [[Arabs]], and many more were slaves used not only for labor, but also for amusement (e.g. [[gladiator]]s and [[sex slave]]s). If a slave ran away, he was liable to be [[crucified]]. By the late Republican era, slavery had become a vital economic pillar in the wealth of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dl.ket.org/latinlit/mores/slaves/ |title=Slavery |publisher= |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire]], probably over 25% of the empire's population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://abacus.bates.edu/~mimber/Rciv/slavery.htm Roman Slavery]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 to 40% of the population of Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/slavery_01.shtml |title=BBC – History – Resisting Slavery in Ancient Rome |publisher=BBC  |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was enslaved.

In the [[Viking]] era beginning circa 793, the [[Norsemen|Norse]] raiders often captured and enslaved militarily weaker peoples they encountered. In the [[Nordic countries]] the slaves were called ''[[thrall]]s'' ([[Old Norse]]: ''Þræll'').&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/thralls.shtml Slavery and Thralldom: The Unfree in Viking Scandinavia]&lt;/ref&gt; The thralls were mostly from Western Europe, among them many [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Celts]]. Many Irish slaves participated in the colonization of [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/iceland/history.html Iceland History]&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of German, Baltic, Slavic and Latin slaves as well. The slave trade was one of the pillars of Norse commerce during the 6th through 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://web.archive.org/web/20091028035150/http://www.geocities.com/klevius/vikings.html?1147920871406 Origin of Vikings: Algeidjuborg trafficking of &quot;valkyries&quot; to Islam]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian traveller [[Ibn Rustah]] described how Swedish Vikings, the [[Varangians]] or [[Rus' Khaganate|Rus]], terrorized and enslaved the [[East Slavs|Slavs]].

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Slavery in medieval Europe}}

Chaos and invasion made the taking of slaves habitual throughout Europe in the [[early Middle Ages]]. [[St. Patrick]], himself captured and sold as a slave, protested against an attack that enslaved newly baptized Christians in his [[q:Saint Patrick#Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus (c.450?)|Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus]].
[[File:360Niklas Stör Entführung in die Sklaverei.jpg|thumb|Ottoman advances resulted in many captive Christians being carried deep into Muslim territory.]]

Slavery during the [[Early Middle Ages]] had several distinct sources. The [[Vikings]] raided across Europe, though their slave raids were the most destructive in the British Isles and Eastern Europe. While the Vikings kept some slaves for themselves as servants, known as [[thralls]], most people captured by the Vikings would be sold on the [[Byzantine]] or Islamic markets. In the West the targets of Viking slavery were primarily English, Irish, and Scottish, while in the East they were mainly [[Slavs]]. The Viking slave trade slowly ended in the 11th century, as the Vikings settled in the European territories they once raided, [[Christianized]] serfdom, and merged with the local populace. The Normans made slaves of the English gentry after invasion in 1066 and deported them to Spain. They continued taking Welsh Slaves during the Medieval period who were traded in London.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Islamic World]] was also a main factor in [[Medieval]] European slavery. Although slavery had different implications for slaves: (i) If they converted to Islam their master had the obligation to free them and if they did not they have to teach them. (ii) Slaves could rise socially by marriage and attain high office. (iii) The principal requirement was for military service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
The conquest by Tariq took place in 711&amp;nbsp;AD to liberate the population from Visigoth persecution [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] (in his speech to his troops though, Ibn Ziyad spoke more of women they would capture more than liberating the people of Iberia). Raiding often involved taking slaves and involved Viking assistance. In the 16th and 17th [[centuries]] during the Protestant Catholic Wars, the [[North Africans]] intensified the white slave trade with European collaboration, although slavery was practised in Christian states as well until the end of [[serfdom]] (a practice that could be more brutal than slavery).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The Muslim powers of Iberia both raided for slaves and purchased slaves from European merchants, often the Jewish [[Radhanites]], one of the few groups that could easily move between the Christian and Islamic worlds. As the Muslims failed to conquer Europe in the 8th century, they made an alliance with the Vikings who raided the shores of Spain, southern Portugal and France, and Italy, that would last roughly from the 9th century until the 12th century, when the Italian city-states of [[Genoa]], Venice, and [[Pisa]], along with the Spanish kingdoms of [[Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], as well as the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Normans]], began to dominate the [[Mediterranean]] trade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The [[Middle Ages]] from 1100 to 1500 saw a continuation of the European slave trade, though with a shift from the Western Mediterranean Islamic nations to the Eastern, as Venice and Genoa, in firm control of the Eastern Mediterranean from the 12th century and the [[Black Sea]] from the 13th century sold both [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Balts|Baltic]] slaves, as well as [[Georgians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and other ethnic groups of the Black Sea and [[Caucasus]], to the Muslim nations of the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The sale of European slaves by Europeans slowly ended as the Slavic and Baltic ethnic groups [[Christianized]] by the [[Late Middle Ages]]. European slaves in the Islamic World would, however, continue into the Modern time period as Muslim pirates, primarily [[Algeria]]ns, with the support of the [[Ottoman Empire]], raided European coasts and shipping from the 16th to the 19th centuries, ending their attacks with the naval decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th and 17th [[centuries]], as well as the European conquest of North Africa throughout the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[File:Giovanni Maria Morandi - Religieux.jpg|thumb|240px|The ransoming of Christians slaves held in Turkish hands, 17th century]]
Slave commerce during the [[Late Middle Ages]] was mainly in the hands of [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchants and cartels, who were involved in the slave trade with the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan [[Tokhtamysh]] sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves. Between 1414 and 1423, some 10,000 eastern European slaves were sold in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxie.org/books/shoulders/ch02-labor.html How To Reboot Reality—Chapter 2, Labor] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genoese merchants organized the slave trade from the [[Crimea]] to [[Mamluk#Mamluk power in Egypt|Mamluk Egypt]].

slaves and to plunder towns.

In 1441, [[Haci I Giray]] declared independence from the Golden Horde and established the [[Crimean Khanate]]. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Middle East. In a process called the &quot;harvesting of the [[steppe]]&quot;, they enslaved many Slavic peasants. About 30 major Tatar raids were recorded into [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovite]] territories between 1558 and 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=Supply of Slaves |publisher=Coursesa.matrix.msu.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin and taking thousands of captives as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/cities/printStory.cfm?obj_id=9141603&amp;city_id=MCW Moscow – Historical background] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Crimea]], about 75% of the population consisted of slaves.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica-24157&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Historical survey &gt; Slave societies |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval Spain]] and [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] were the scene of almost constant [[warfare]] between Muslims and Christians. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from [[Al-Andalus]] to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. In a raid against [[Lisbon]], Portugal in 1189, for example, the [[Almohad]] caliph [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] took 3,000 female and child captives, while his governor of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], in a subsequent attack upon [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], Portugal in 1191, took 3,000 Christian slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James William Brodman |url=http://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm |title=Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain: The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier |publisher=Libro.uca.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th-century [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] exploration of the African coast is commonly regarded as the harbinger of European colonialism. In 1452, [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[papal bull]] [[Dum Diversas]], granting [[Afonso V of Portugal]] the right to reduce any &quot;Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers&quot; to hereditary slavery which legitimized slave trade under Catholic beliefs of that time. This approval of slavery was reaffirmed and extended in his [[Romanus Pontifex]] bull of 1455. These papal bulls came to serve as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European [[colonialism]]. Although for a short period as in 1462, Pius II declared slavery to be &quot;a great crime&quot;.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Allard | first = Paul | title = Slavery and Christianity | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = XIV | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York | year = 1912 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14036a.htm | accessdate =4 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of the church of England and Protestants did not use the papal bull as a justification. The position of the church was to condemn the slavery of Christians, but slavery was regarded as an old established and necessary institution which supplied Europe with the necessary workforce. In the 16th century African slaves had substituted almost all other ethnicities and religious enslaved groups in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Klein, Herbert. ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Portuguese territory of Brazil, and even beyond its original borders, the enslavement of native Americans was carried out by the [[Bandeirantes]].

Spain had to fight against relatively powerful civilizations of the [[New World]]. However, the Spanish conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas was also facilitated by the spread of diseases (e.g. [[smallpox]]) due to lack of biological immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9968/9968.ch01.html |title=David A.

Although the natives were used as forced labor (the Spanish employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm |title=U.S. Library of Congress |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the spread of disease caused a shortage of labor, and so the Spanish colonists gradually became involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html Health in slavery] {{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1517, the natives had been &quot;virtually annihilated&quot; by the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2028.html?countryName=Haiti&amp;countryCode=ha&amp;regionCode=ca&amp;#ha |title=CIA Factbook: Haiti |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
Although slavery was illegal inside the [[History of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] it flourished in the Dutch Empire, and helped support the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Postma, ''The Dutch in the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600–1815'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1650 the Dutch had the pre-eminent slave trade in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Emmer, Chris Emery, &quot;The Dutch Slave Trade, 1500–1850&quot; (2006) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; They were overtaken by Britain around 1700. Historians agree that in all the Dutch shipped about 550,000 African slaves across the Atlantic, about 75,000 of whom died on board before reaching their destinations. From 1596 to 1829, the Dutch traders sold 250,000 slaves in the Dutch Guianas, 142,000 in the Dutch Caribbean islands, and 28,000 in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Rik Van Welie, &quot;Slave Trading and Slavery in the Dutch Colonial Empire: A Global Comparison,&quot; ''NWIG: New West Indian Guide / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids,'' 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 1/2, pp 47–96 [http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/view/3580/4340 tables 2 and 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, tens of thousands of slaves, mostly from India and some from Africa, were carried to the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Vink Markus, &quot;'The World's Oldest Trade': Dutch Slavery and Slave Trade in the Indian Ocean in the Seventeenth Century,&quot; ''Journal of World History'' June 2003 [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/14.2/vink.html 24 Dec 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain and Ireland===
{{Main|Slavery in Britain and Ireland|Slavery in the colonial United States}}
Slavery was practised by the Romans, but when they left in the 5th century they took their slaves with them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Anglo-Saxon Germanic settlers brought in slaves. Capture in war, voluntary servitude and debt slavery became common, and slaves were routinely bought and sold, but running away was common and slavery was never a major economic factor. Ireland and Denmark were markets for captured Anglo Saxon and Celtic slaves. Pope Gregory I reputedly made the pun, ''Non Angli, sed Angeli'' (&quot;Not Angles, but Angels&quot;), after a response to his query regarding the identity of a group of fair-haired [[Anglian|Angles]] slave children whom he had observed in the marketplace. After 1100 slavery faded away as uneconomical.&lt;ref&gt;Allen J. Frantzen and Douglas Moffat, eds. ''The work of work: servitude, slavery, and labor in Medieval England'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barbary Corsairs====
From the 16th to 19th century, [[Barbary Corsairs]] raided the coasts of Europe and attacked lone ships at sea. From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates. 160 English ships were captured by Algerians between 1677 and 1680.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Slaves on the Barbary Coast&quot;/&gt; Many of the captured sailors were made into slaves and held for ransom. The corsairs were no strangers to the South West of England where raids were known in a number of coastal communities. In 1627 [[Barbary Pirates]] under command of the Dutch renegade [[Jan Janszoon]] operating from the Moroccan port of [[Salé]] occupied the island of [[Lundy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Piracy: the complete history | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&amp;pg=PA91 | accessdate=15 April 2011 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | isbn=978-1-84603-240-0 | last=Konstam |first=Angus | year=2008 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time there were reports of captured slaves being sent to Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Pirates who got away with it | work=Study of sails on pirate ships | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article1449736.ece | accessdate=25 November 2007 | location=London | date=28 February 2007 | first=Simon | last=de Bruxelles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Europe: a History | work=Norman Davis | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA561&amp;lpg=PA561&amp;dq=barbary+lundy | accessdate=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland, despite its northern position, was not immune from attacks by the corsairs. In June 1631 [[Murat Reis the Younger|Murat Reis]], with pirates from [[Algiers]] and armed troops of the [[Ottoman Empire]], stormed ashore at the little harbor village of [[Baltimore, County Cork]]. They [[Sack of Baltimore|captured almost all the villagers]] and took them away to a life of slavery in North Africa.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{1911|article=Barbary Pirates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates—some lived out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves, while others would spend long years in the scented seclusion of the harem or within the walls of the sultan's palace. Only two of them ever saw Ireland again.

====Atlantic slave trade====
{{main |Atlantic slave trade}}

Britain played a prominent role in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], especially after 1600. Slavery was a legal institution in all of the 13 [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and Canada (acquired by Britain in 1763). The profits of the slave trade and of [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations amounted to 5% of the [[Economic history of Britain|British economy]] at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Somersett's case]] in 1772 was generally taken at the time to have decided that the condition of slavery did not exist under [[English law]] in England. In 1785, English poet [[William Cowper]] wrote: &quot;We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air, that moment they are free. They touch our country, and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Nick (2003). William Cowper: Selected Poems. p.84. Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, following many years of lobbying by the [[abolitionism|Abolitionist movement]], the [[British Parliament]] voted to make the slave trade illegal anywhere in the Empire with the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. Thereafter Britain took a prominent role in combating the trade, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. Between 1808 and 1860, the [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore] BBC&lt;/ref&gt; Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against &quot;the usurping King of [[Lagos]]&quot;, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS |title=The West African Squadron and slave trade |publisher=Pdavis.nl |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, [[Anti-Slavery International]], was formed in Britain by [[Joseph Sturge]], which worked to outlaw slavery in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Anti-Slavery International] UNESCO. Retrieved 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, [[Arthur William Hodge]] was the first slave owner executed for the murder of a slave in the [[British West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN073881931X&amp;id=t2Tu-PJxhb0C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22hanging+of+arthur+hodge%22 The Hanging of Arthur Hodge]''[http://www2.xlibris.com/bookstore/bookdisplay.asp?bookid=970 The Hanging of Arthur Hodge], [[Xlibris]], 2000, ISBN 978-0-7388-1930-3. The assertion is probably correct; there appear to be no other records of any British slave owners being executed for holding slaves, and, given the excitement which the Hodge trial excited, it seems improbable that another execution could have occurred without attracting attention. Slavery itself as an institution in the British West Indies only continued for another 23 years after Hodge's death.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not, however, as some have claimed, the first [[white people|white person]] to have been [[capital punishment|lawfully executed]] for the [[Murder|killing]] of a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', ISBN 978-0-934139-05-2, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Records indicate at least two earlier incidents. On 23 November 1739, in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], Virginia, two white men, Charles Quin and David White, were hanged for the murder of another white man's black slave; and on 21 April 1775, the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] newspaper, the ''[[Virginia Gazette]]'' reported that a white man William Pitman had been hanged for the murder of his own black slave. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN078640339X&amp;id=quwi6J7GZ6wC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22murder+of+a+negro#PPA101,M1 Blacks in Colonial America]'', p101, Oscar Reiss, McFarland &amp; Company, 1997; ''[http://departments.umw.edu/hipr/www/Fredericksburg/newspapers/vagaz/12may75s_1_3.htm Virginia Gazette'', 21 April 1775], [[University of Mary Washington]] Department of Historic Preservation archives {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-industrial Europe===
It became the custom among the [[Mediterranean]] powers to sentence condemned criminals to row in the war-[[galley]]s of the state (initially only in time of war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi303.htm |title=The Last Galleys |publisher=Uh.edu |date=1 August 2004 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[Huguenots]] filled the galleys after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 and [[Camisard|Camisard rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manakin.addr.com/galleys.html |title=Huguenots and the Galleys |publisher=Manakin.addr.com |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galley-slaves]] lived in unsavoury conditions, so even though some sentences prescribed a restricted number of years, most rowers would eventually die, even if they survived [[shipwreck]] and [[murder|slaughter]] or torture at the hands of enemies or of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milism.net/galere.htm |title=French galley slaves of the ancien régime |publisher=Milism.net |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naval warfare|Naval forces]] often turned 'infidel' [[prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] into galley-slaves. Several well-known historical figures served time as galley slaves after being captured by the enemy—the Ottoman corsair and admiral [[Turgut Reis]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] Grand Master [[Jean Parisot de la Valette]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanandrea.edu.mt/Senior/CyberFair/knights/5a.html |title=The Great Siege of 1565 |publisher=Sanandrea.edu.mt |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1440s into the 18th century hundreds of thousands of [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainians]] were sold into slavery to the Turks. In 1575, the [[Tatars]] captured over 35,000 Ukrainians; a 1676 raid took almost 40,000. About 60,000 Ukrainians were captured in 1688; some were ransomed, but most were sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Junius A.

[[Denmark-Norway]] was the first European country to ban the slave trade. This happened with a decree issued by the [[Christian VII of Denmark|king]] in 1792, to become fully effective by 1803. Slavery itself was not banned until 1848. At this time [[Iceland]] was a part of [[Denmark-Norway]] but slave trading had been abolished in Iceland in 1117 and had never been reestablished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=abolish+slavery+iceland#v=onepage&amp;q=abolish%20slavery%20iceland&amp;f=false |title=The Historical encyclopedia of world slavery, Volume 1 By Junius P.

Slavery in the [[French Republic]] was abolished on 4 February 1794 however it was re-established by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1804. Slavery would be permanently abolished in the French empire during the French Revolution of 1848. The [[Haitian Revolution]] established [[Haiti]] as a free republic ruled by blacks, the first of its kind.&lt;ref name=Haiti/&gt; At the time of the revolution, Haiti was known as [[Saint-Domingue]] and was a colony of France.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Popkin, ''You Are All Free: The Haitian Revolution and the Abolition of Slavery''(Cambridge University Press; 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Europe===
During [[The Holocaust]], the [[Germans]] used slave labor from across occupied Europe to support their war effort, and numbering perhaps 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/chap_10.asp Yale Law School Avalon Project] retrieved 8 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/germancos.html |title=German Firms That Used Slave or Forced Labor During the Nazi Era |date=27 January 2000 |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005180 United States Holocaust Museum] retrieved 8 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The communist Soviet Union had 10–20 million people working in [[Gulags]] during its existence. This camp system was also used to colonize Siberia.

==Africa==
{{Main|African slave trade|Slavery in modern Africa}}
[[File:ManillaOkhapos.JPG|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Two slightly differing [[Manillas|Okpoho manillas]] as used to purchase slaves&lt;center&gt;]]

In most African societies, there was very little difference between the free peasants and the feudal vassal peasants. Vassals of the [[Songhai people|Songhay]] Muslim Empire were used primarily in agriculture; they paid tribute to their masters in crop and service but they were slightly restricted in custom and convenience. These people were more an occupational caste, as their bondage was relative.
In the Kanem Bornu Empire, vassals were three classes beneath the nobles. Marriage between captor and captive was far from rare, blurring the anticipated roles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabslavetrade.com|publisher=&quot;[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]]&quot;|title=Slavery In Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] noted that slavery was endemic in Africa and part of the structure of everyday life. &quot;Slavery came in different disguises in different societies: there were court slaves, slaves incorporated into princely armies, domestic and household slaves, slaves working on the land, in industry, as couriers and intermediaries, even as traders&quot; (Braudel 1984 p.&amp;nbsp;435). During the 16th century, Europe began to outpace the [[Arab world]] in the export traffic, with its slave traffic from Africa to the Americas. The Dutch imported slaves from Asia into their colony in South Africa. In 1807 Britain, which held extensive, although mainly coastal colonial territories on the African continent (including southern Africa), [[Slave Trade Act 1807|made the ''international'' slave trade illegal]], as did the United States in 1808.  The end of the slave trade and the decline of slavery was imposed upon Africa by outside powers.

The nature of the slave societies differed greatly across the continent. There were large plantations worked by slaves in [[Egypt]], the [[Sudan]] and [[Zanzibar]], but this was not a typical use of slaves in Africa as a whole. In most African slave societies, slaves were protected and incorporated into the slave-owning family.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]], between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was enslaved. In early Islamic states of the western Sudan, including [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]] (750–1076), [[Mali Empire|Mali]] (1235–1645), [[Bamana Empire|Segou]] (1712–1861), and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] (1275–1591), about a third of the population were slaves. In [[Sierra Leone]] in the 19th century about half of the population consisted of slaves. In the 19th century at least half the population was enslaved among the [[Duala people|Duala]] of the [[Cameroon]], the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and other peoples of the lower [[Niger river|Niger]], the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and the Kasanje kingdom and [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] of [[Angola]]. Among the [[The Ashanti|Ashanti]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] a third of the population consisted of slaves. The population of the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] was about a third-slave. It was perhaps 40% in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] (1396–1893). Between 1750 and 1900 from one- to two-thirds of the entire population of the [[Fulani jihad]] states consisted of slaves. The population of the [[Sokoto]] caliphate formed by [[Hausa people|Hausas]] in the northern [[Nigeria]] and Cameroon was half-slave in the 19th century. It is estimated that up to 90% of the population of [[Arab]]-[[Swahili people|Swahili]] [[Zanzibar]] was enslaved. Roughly half the population of [[Madagascar]] was enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521374693 Slow Death for Slavery – Cambridge University Press] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slav_fact.cfm |title=Digital History Slavery Fact Sheets |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-TanzaniaZanzibar.htm Tanzania – Stone Town of Zanzibar] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bartelby.com/67/871.html |title=18th and Early 19th centuries.

[[David Livingstone]] wrote of the slave trades:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility.... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead.... We came upon a man dead from starvation....

Prior to the 16th century, the bulk of slaves exported from Africa were shipped from East Africa to the [[Arabian peninsula]]. [[Zanzibar]] became a leading port in this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones.

The increased presence of European rivals along the East coast led Arab traders to concentrate on the overland slave caravan routes across the [[Sahara]] from the [[Sahel]] to North Africa. The German explorer [[Gustav Nachtigal]] reported seeing slave caravans departing from [[Kukawa]] in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] bound for [[Tripoli]] and [[Egypt]] in 1870. The slave trade represented the major source of revenue for the state of Bornu as late as 1898. The eastern regions of the [[Central African Republic]] have never recovered demographically from the impact of 19th-century raids from the [[Sudan]] and still have a population density of less than 1 person/km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40699/Central-African-Republic |title=Central African Republic: Early history |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, European initiatives against the slave trade caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] forces. [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]]'s victory created an Islamic state, one that quickly reinstituted slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/ted/ice/sudan.htm |title=Civil War in the Sudan: Resources or Religion? |publisher=American.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-20649477.html Slave trade in the Sudan in the nineteenth century and its suppression in the years 1877–80.]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Passage]], the crossing of the [[Atlantic]] to [[the Americas]], endured by slaves laid out in rows in the holds of ships, was only one element of the well-known [[triangular trade]] engaged in by Portuguese, Dutch, French and British. Ships having landed slaves in [[Caribbean]] ports would take on sugar, indigo, raw cotton, and later coffee, and make for [[Liverpool]], [[Nantes]], Lisbon or [[Amsterdam]]. Ships leaving European ports for West Africa would carry printed cotton textiles, some originally from India, copper utensils and bangles, pewter plates and pots, iron bars more valued than gold, hats, trinkets, gunpowder and firearms and alcohol. Tropical [[shipworm]]s were eliminated in the cold Atlantic waters, and at each unloading, a profit was made.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by African kingdoms, such as the [[Oyo empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), [[Kong Empire]], [[Kingdom of Benin]], [[Kingdom of Fouta Djallon]], [[Kingdom of Fouta Tooro]], [[Kingdom of Koya]], [[Kingdom of Khasso]], [[Kaabu|Kingdom of Kaabu]], [[Fante Confederacy]], [[The Ashanti|Ashanti Confederacy]], [[Aro Confederacy]] and the kingdom of [[Dahomey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetpuppets.org/afrghana.html The Great Slave Empires Of Africa] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm |title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of [[tropical diseases|disease]] and moreover fierce African resistance. The slaves were brought to coastal outposts where they were traded for goods. The people captured on these expeditions were shipped by European traders to the colonies of the [[New World]]. As a result of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the United Kingdom obtained the monopoly (''[[asiento de negros]]'') of transporting captive Africans to [[Spanish America]]. It is estimated that over the centuries, twelve to twenty million people were shipped as slaves from Africa by European traders, of whom some 15 percent died during the terrible voyage, many during the arduous journey through the [[Middle Passage]]. The great majority were shipped to the Americas, but some also went to Europe and Southern Africa.

====African participation in the slave trade====
{{See also|Atlantic slave trade}}
Some African states played a role in the slave trade. They would sell their captives or prisoners of war to European buyers.&lt;ref name=afbis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm |title=Slave trade: a root of contemporary African Crisis |author=Tunde Obadina |publisher=Africa Business Information Services |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selling captives or prisoners was common practice among Africans and Arabs during that era. However, as the Atlantic slave trade increased its demand, local systems which primarily serviced indentured servitude became corrupted and started to supply the European slave traders, changing social dynamics. It also ultimately undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labor forces were shipped overseas as slave raids and civil wars became commonplace. Crimes which were previously punishable by some other punishment became punishable by enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/html_ah/holocaustspecial.htm | title= African Holocaust Special  | publisher=African Holocaust Society | accessdate=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prisoners and captives that were sold were usually from neighboring or enemy ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the4thworld.net/node/15 |title=Myth Busting: &quot;Africans Sold Their Own Into Slavery and Are Just As Guilty as Whites...&quot; |author=Souljah |date=22 February 2007 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These captive slaves were not considered as part of the ethnic group or 'tribe' and kings did not have a particular loyalty to them. At times, kings and chiefs would sell criminals into slavery so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans.&lt;ref name=afbis/&gt; Some African kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals. King [[Jaja of Opobo]], a former slave himself, completely refused to do business with slavers.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; Ashanti King Agyeman Prempeh (Ashanti king, b. 1872) also sacrificed his own freedom so that his people would not face collective slavery.&lt;ref name=blog/&gt;
{{Quotation|The viewpoint that “Africans” enslaved “Africans” is obfuscating if not troubling. The deployment of “African” in African history tends to coalesce into obscurantist constructions of identities that allow scholars, for instance, to subtly call into question the humanity of “all” Africans. Whenever Asante rulers sold non-Asantes into slavery, they did not construct it in terms of Africans selling fellow Africans. They saw the victims for what they were, for instance, as Akuapems, without categorizing them as fellow Africans. Equally, when Christian Scandinavians and Russians sold war captives to the Islamic people of the Abbasid Empire, they didn’t think that they were placing fellow Europeans into slavery. This lazy categorizing homogenizes Africans and has become a part of the methodology of African history; not surprisingly, the Western media’s cottage industry on Africa has tapped into it to frame Africans in inchoate generalities allowing the media to describe local crisis in one African state as “African” problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=180999 |title=Dr. Akurang-Parry |publisher=Ghanaweb.com |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Dr. Akurang-Parry|Ending the Slavery Blame}}

Before the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], slavery had already existed in [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. Despite its establishment within his kingdom, [[Afonso I of Kongo]] believed that the slave trade should be subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote letters to the King [[João III]] of Portugal in 1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~winthrop/Thornton.html African Political Ethics and the Slave Trade] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Dahomey]] sold their [[POW|war captives]] into transatlantic slavery, who otherwise would have been killed in a ceremony known as the [[The annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]].

The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the &quot;Slave Coast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter7.shtml |title=The Story of Africa |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007£2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.67|200th anniversary of the British act of parliament abolishing slave trading, commemorated on a [[British two pound coin]].]]
In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the Bill that abolished the trading of slaves. The King of Bonny (now in [[Nigeria]]) was horrified at the conclusion of the practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml |title=African Slave Owners |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''We think this trade must go on. That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.''&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some historians conclude that the total loss in persons removed, those who died on the arduous march to coastal slave marts and those killed in slave raids, far exceeded the 65–75 million inhabitants remaining in Sub-Saharan Africa at the trade's end.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Others believe that slavers had a vested interest in capturing rather than killing, and in keeping their captives alive; and that this coupled with the disproportionate removal of males and the introduction of new crops from the Americas ([[cassava]], maize) would have limited general [[population decline]] to particular regions of western Africa around 1760–1810, and in [[Mozambique]] and neighbouring areas half a century later. There has also been speculation that within Africa, females were most often [[Bride kidnapping|captured as brides]], with their male protectors being a &quot;bycatch&quot; who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for them.

During the period from late 19th century and early 20th century, demand for the labor-intensive harvesting of rubber drove frontier expansion and slavery. The personal monarchy of Belgian King Leopold II in the [[Congo Free State]] saw mass killings and slavery to extract rubber.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Hochschild, ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
{{See also|Slavery in modern Africa}}
The trading of children has been reported in modern [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]]. In parts of [[Ghana]], a family may be punished for an offense by having to turn over a virgin female to serve as a [[sexual slavery|sex slave]] within the offended family. In this instance, the woman does not gain the title or status of &quot;wife&quot;. In parts of Ghana, [[Togo]], and [[Benin]], shrine slavery persists, despite being illegal in Ghana since 1998. In this system of [[ritual servitude]], sometimes called ''trokosi'' (in Ghana) or ''voodoosi'' in Togo and Benin, young virgin girls are given as slaves to traditional shrines and are used sexually by the priests in addition to providing free labor for the shrine.

===Among indigenous peoples===
{{Main|Aztec slavery|Repartimiento|Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery in Canada|Pre-Columbian America}}
In Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] the most common forms of slavery were those of [[prisoners-of-war]] and debtors. People unable to pay back a debt could be sentenced to work as a slave to the person owed until the debt was worked off. Warfare was important to the [[Maya society]], because raids on surrounding areas provided the victims required for human [[sacrifice]], as well as slaves for the construction of temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umaine.edu/hudson/palmer/Maya/society.asp |title=Maya Society |publisher=Library.umaine.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most victims of [[Human sacrifice#Pre-Columbian sacrifice|human sacrifice]] were prisoners of war or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367541 |title=human sacrifice – Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aztec]] writings, as many as 84,000 people were sacrificed at a temple inauguration in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/history/human_sacrifice_050123.html Evidence May Back Human Sacrifice Claims |LiveScience] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not usually hereditary; children of slaves were born free. In the [[Inca Empire]], workers were subject to a ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'' in lieu of taxes which they paid by working for the government. Each ''[[ayllu]]'', or extended family, would decide which family member to send to do the work. It is unclear if this labor draft or [[corvée]] counts as slavery. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] adopted this system, particularly for their silver mines in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm |title=Bolivia – Ethnic Groups |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other slave-owning societies and tribes of the New World were, for example, the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] of Patagonia, the [[Comanche]] of Texas, the [[Caribs]] of Dominica, the [[Tupinambá]] of Brazil, the fishing societies, such as the [[Yurok people|Yurok]], that lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and [[Klamath people|Klamath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Slavery in the New World |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], such as the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California.

Slavery was a mainstay of the [[Economic history of Brazil|Brazilian colonial economy]], especially in mining and [[sugar cane]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S. Klein and Francisco Vidal Luna, ''Slavery in Brazil'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil obtained 38% of all African slaves traded, and more than 3 million slaves were sent to this one country. Starting around 1550, the Portuguese began to trade African slaves to work the sugar plantations, once the native [[Tupi people]] deteriorated. Although Portuguese Prime Minister [[Marquês de Pombal]] abolished slavery in mainland Portugal on 12 February 1761, slavery continued in her overseas colonies. Slavery was practiced among all classes. Slaves were owned by upper and middle classes, by the poor, and even by other slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/evanson/brazilhistory/Bahia.htm |title=Rebellions in Bahia, 1798-l838.

From [[São Paulo]], the [[Bandeirantes]], adventurers mostly of mixed [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search for Indian slaves. Along the [[Amazon river]] and its major tributaries, repeated slaving raids and punitive attacks left their mark. One French traveler in the 1740s described ''hundreds of miles of river banks with no sign of human life and once-thriving villages that were devastated and empty.'' In some areas of the [[Amazon Basin]], and particularly among the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] of southern [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]], the [[Jesuits]] had organized their [[Jesuit Reductions]] along military lines to fight the slavers. In the mid-to-late 19th century, many [[Amerindian]]s were enslaved to work on rubber plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9012127/bandeira |title=Bandeira |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356505/bandeira |title=Bandeira – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v-brazil.com/information/history/bandeirantes.html |title=Bandeirantes |publisher=V-brazil.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resistance and abolition====
Escaped slaves formed [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] communities which played an important role in the histories of [[History of Brazil|Brazil]] and other countries such as [[History of Suriname|Suriname]], [[History of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[History of Cuba|Cuba]], and [[History of Jamaica|Jamaica]]. In Brazil, the Maroon villages were called [[Palenque (village)|palenques]] or [[quilombo]]s. Maroons survived by growing vegetables and hunting. They also raided [[plantations]]. At these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their communities.

[[Jean-Baptiste Debret]], a French painter who was active in Brazil in the first decades of the 19th century, started out with painting portraits of members of the Brazilian Imperial family, but soon became concerned with the slavery of both blacks and indigenous inhabitants. His paintings on the subject (two appear on this page) helped bring attention to the subject in both Europe and Brazil itself.

The [[Clapham Sect]], a group of [[Evangelism|evangelical]] reformers, campaigned during much of the 19th century for the United Kingdom to use its influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16&amp;nbsp;pounds (7&amp;nbsp;kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades.

First, foreign slave trade was banned in 1850. Then, in 1871, the sons of the slaves were freed. In 1885, slaves aged over 60 years were freed. The [[Paraguayan War]] contributed to ending slavery, since many slaves enlisted in exchange for freedom. In Colonial Brazil, slavery was more a social than a racial condition. In fact, some of the greatest figures of the time, like the writer [[Machado de Assis]] and the engineer [[André Rebouças]] had black ancestry.

Brazil's 1877–78 ''Grande Seca'' (Great Drought) in the cotton-growing northeast led to major turmoil, starvation, poverty and internal migration. As wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves south, popular resistance and resentment grew, inspiring numerous emancipation societies. They succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of Ceará by 1884.&lt;ref&gt;(Mike Davis, ''Late Victorian Holocausts'', 88–90)&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was legally ended nationwide on 13 May by the ''[[Lei Aurea]]'' (&quot;Golden Law&quot;) of 1888. In fact, it was an institution in decadence at these times, as since the 1880s the country had begun to use European immigrant labor instead. Brazil was the last nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]] to abolish slavery.

During the period from late 19th century and early 20th century, demand for the labor-intensive harvesting of rubber drove frontier expansion and slavery in Latin America and elsewhere. Indigenous people were enslaved as part of the [[rubber boom]] in Ecuador, [[Peru]], Colombia, and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edward Stanfield , ''Red Rubber, Bleeding Trees: Violence, Slavery, and Empire in Northwest Amazonia, 1850–1933''&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, rubber tappers participated in the enslavement of the indigenous Guatuso-Maleku people for domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edelman, &quot;A Central American Genocide: Rubber, Slavery, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Guatusos-Malekus,&quot; Comparative Studies in Society and History (1998), 40: 356–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British and French Caribbean===
{{Main|Slavery in the British and French Caribbean}}

Slavery was commonly used in the parts of the [[Caribbean]] controlled by France and the [[British Empire]]. The [[Lesser Antilles]] islands of [[History of Barbados|Barbados]], [[History of Saint Kitts and Nevis|St. Kitts]], [[History of Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]], [[History of Martinique|Martinique]] and [[History of Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe]], which were the first important slave societies of the [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean]], began the widespread use of African slaves by the end of the 17th century, as their economies converted from sugar production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDC103EF934A1575BC0A963958260 |title=Involuntary Immigrants |work=New York Times |date=27 August 1995 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 18th century, British [[Jamaica]] and French [[Saint-Domingue]] had become the largest slave societies of the region, and the [[Caribbean]] was rivaling Brazil as a destination for enslaved Africans. Due to overwork and tropical diseases, the death rates for Caribbean slaves were greater than birth rates. The conditions led to increasing numbers of [[slave revolt]]s, escaped slaves forming [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] communities and fighting guerrilla wars against the plantation owners.

To regularise slavery, in 1685 [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had enacted the ''[[code noir]]'', which accorded certain human rights to slaves and responsibilities to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe and provide for the general well-being of his slaves.

[[Whitehall]] in England announced in 1833 that slaves in its territories would be totally freed by 1840. In the meantime, the government told slaves they had to remain on their plantations and would have the status of &quot;apprentices&quot; for the next six years.

In [[Port-of-Spain]], [[Trinidad]], on 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly Negroes being addressed by the Governor at Government House about the new laws, began chanting: &quot;Pas de six ans. Point de six ans&quot; (&quot;Not six years. No six years&quot;), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish [[apprenticeship]] was passed and ''de facto'' freedom was achieved. Full [[abolitionism|emancipation]] for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838, making Trinidad the first British colony with slaves to completely abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, John. 1992 &quot;Pas de Six Ans!&quot; In: ''Seven Slaves &amp; Slavery: Trinidad 1777–1838'', by Anthony de Verteuil, Port of Spain, pp. 371–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Great Britain abolished slavery, it began to pressure other nations to do the same. France, too, abolished slavery. By then Saint-Domingue had already won its independence and formed the independent Republic of [[Haiti]]. French-controlled islands were then limited to a few smaller islands in the [[Lesser Antilles]].

====Early events====
The first slaves used by Europeans in what later became United States territory were among [[Lucas Vásquez de Ayllón]]'s colonization attempt of [[North Carolina]] in 1526. The attempt was a failure, lasting only one year; the slaves revolted and fled into the wilderness to live among the [[Creek people|Cofitachiqui]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1752906 |title=Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon |author=Niruena |date=18 September 2005 |publisher=Everything2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historically significant slave in what would become the United States was [[Estevanico]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] slave and member of the [[Narváez expedition]] in 1528 and acted as a guide on Fray [[Marcos de Niza]]'s expedition to find the [[Quivira and Cíbola|Seven Cities of Gold]] in 1539.

In 1619 twenty Africans were brought by a Dutch soldier and sold to the English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] as [[indentured servant]]s. It is possible that Africans were brought to Virginia prior to this, both because neither [[John Rolfe]] our source on the 1619 shipment nor any contemporary of his ever says that this was the first contingent of Africans to come to Virginia and because the 1625 Virginia census lists one black as coming on a ship that appears to only have landed people in Virginia prior to 1619.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, Alden T. &quot;Blacks in Virginia: A Note on the First Decade&quot; in ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 29 (1972) no. 3, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation from indentured servitude to racial slavery happened gradually. It was not until 1661 that a reference to slavery entered into [[Virginia]] law, directed at Caucasian servants who ran away with a black servant. It was not until the [[Slave Codes of 1705]] that the status of African Americans as slaves would be sealed. This status would last for another 160 years, until after the end of the [[American Civil War]] with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865.

Only a fraction of the enslaved Africans brought to the [[New World]] ended up in [[British North America]]—perhaps 5%. The vast majority of slaves shipped across the Atlantic were sent to the [[Caribbean]] sugar colonies, [[Brazil]], or [[Spanish America]].

By the 1680s with the consolidation of England's [[Royal African Company]], enslaved Africans were imported to English colonies in larger numbers, and the practice continued to be protected by the [[English Crown]]. Colonists began purchasing slaves in larger numbers.

====Development of slavery====
{{see also|Black Loyalists|James Somersett|Somersett's Case}}
The shift from indentured servants to African slaves was prompted by a dwindling class of former servants who had worked through the terms of their indentures and thus became competitors to their former masters. These newly freed servants were rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was increasingly dominated by large planters. This caused domestic unrest culminating in [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm in regions dominated by plantations.

Many slaves in [[British North America]] were owned by plantation owners who lived in Britain. The British courts had made a series of contradictory rulings on the legality of slavery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/slave_free.htm#top |title=(National Archives Link) |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged several thousand slaves to flee the newly independent United States as refugees along with the retreating British in 1783. The British courts having ruled in 1772 that such slaves could not be forcibly returned to North America, the British government resettled them as free men in [[Sierra Leone]].

Several [[slave rebellion]]s took place during the 17th and 18th centuries.

====Early United States law====
[[File:James Hopkinsons Plantation Slaves Going to Field.jpg|thumb|260px|James Hopkinson's plantation, South Carolina ca. 1862.]]
Through the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 under the [[Congress of the Confederation]], slavery was prohibited in the territories north west of the [[Ohio River]]. By 1804, abolitionists succeeded in passing legislation that would eventually (in conjunction with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]]) emancipate the slaves in every state north of the Ohio River and the [[Mason-Dixon Line]]. However, emancipation in the free states was so gradual that both New York and Pennsylvania listed slaves in their 1840 census returns, and a small number of black slaves were held in New Jersey in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;dq=1840+census+-+new+jersey+slaves&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=page%20471&amp;f=false Dictionary of Afro-American slavery] By Randall M. Miller, John David Smith. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p.471.&lt;/ref&gt; The importation or export of slaves was banned on 1 January 1808;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/opinion/30foner.html Foner, Eric. &quot;Forgotten step towards freedom,&quot;] ''New York Times.'' 30 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but not the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]].

Despite the actions of abolitionists, free blacks were subject to [[Racial segregation in the United States#Issues in the North|racial segregation]] in the Northern states.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA4&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4narr3.html &quot;Africans in America&quot;] – PBS Series – Part 4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was legal in most of Canada until 1833, but after that it offered a haven for hundreds of runaway slaves. Refugees from slavery fled the South across the Ohio River to the North via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Midwestern state governments asserted [[States Rights]] arguments to refuse federal jurisdiction over fugitives. Some juries exercised their right of [[jury nullification]] and refused to convict those indicted under the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].

After the passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] in 1854, armed conflict broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state had been left to the inhabitants. The radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the mayhem and killing in &quot;[[Bleeding Kansas]].&quot; The true turning point in public opinion is better fixed at the [[Lecompton Constitution]] fraud. Pro-slavery elements in Kansas had arrived first from Missouri and quickly organized a territorial government that excluded abolitionists. Through the machinery of the territory and violence, the pro-slavery faction attempted to force an unpopular pro-slavery constitution through the state. This infuriated Northern Democrats, who supported popular sovereignty, and was exacerbated by the [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] administration reneging on a promise to submit the constitution to a referendum – which it would surely fail. Anti-slavery legislators took office under the banner of the newly formed [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The Supreme Court in the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] of 1857 asserted that one could take one's property anywhere, even if one's property was [[chattel]] and one crossed into a free territory. It also asserted that African Americans could not be federal citizens. Outraged critics across the North denounced these episodes as the latest of the [[Slave Power]] (the politically organized slave owners) taking more control of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard L. Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780–1860'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil War====

Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war. According to the [[1860 United States Census]], about 385,000 individuals&lt;ref&gt;Gary A. Warner, [http://www.dailypress.com/travel/dp-travslave26jun24,0,2277645.story Journey to freedom], [[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]], 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. 1.4% of [[White Americans]] in the country, or 4.8% of southern whites) owned one or more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americancivilwar.com/authors/black_slaveowners.htm |title=Black Slaveowners |publisher=Americancivilwar.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernhistory.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=9406&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 Southern History] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the slave population in the United States stood at four million.&lt;ref name=&quot;itd.nps.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |title=Introduction – Social Aspects of the Civil War |publisher=Itd.nps.gov |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to 1% of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]], the Republicans swept [[Abraham Lincoln]] into the Presidency (with only 39.8% of the popular vote) and legislators into Congress. Lincoln however, did not appear on the ballots in most southern states and his election split the nation along sectional lines. After decades of controlling the Federal Government,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} several of the southern states declared they had [[secession|seceded]] from the U.S. (the Union) in an attempt to form the [[Confederate States of America]].

Northern leaders like Lincoln viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, with control over the Mississippi River and the West, as unacceptable. This led to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], which spelled the end for chattel slavery in America. However, in August 1862, Lincoln wrote to editor [[Horace Greeley]] that despite his own moral objection to slavery, the objective of the war was to save the Union and not either to save or to destroy slavery {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} . Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 was a powerful move that proclaimed freedom for slaves within the Confederacy as soon as the Union Army arrived; Lincoln had no power to free slaves in the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] or the rest of the Union, so he promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which freed all the remaining slaves in December 1865. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal and it was implemented as the Union captured territory from the Confederacy. Slaves in many parts of the south were freed by Union armies or when they simply left their former owners. Over 150,000 joined the [[Union Army]] and Navy as soldiers and sailors.

The remaining slaves within the United States remained enslaved until the final ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution on 6 December 1865 (with final recognition of the amendment on 18 December), eight months after the cessation of hostilities. Only in Kentucky did a significant slave population remain by that time, although there were some in West Virginia and Delaware.

After the failure of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], freed slaves in the United States were treated as second class citizens. For decades after their emancipation, many former slaves living in the South [[sharecropping|sharecropped]] and had a low standard of living. In some states, it was only after the [[civil rights]] movement of the 1950s and 60s that blacks obtained legal protection from racial discrimination (''see [[Racial segregation|segregation]]'').

==Oceania==
{{see also|Blackbirding}}
In the first half of the 19th century, small-scale slave raids took place across [[Polynesia]] to supply labor and [[sex workers]] for the [[whaling]] and [[seal hunting|sealing]] trades, with examples from both the westerly and easterly extremes of the [[Polynesian triangle]].
By the 1860s this had grown to a larger scale operation with [[Peru]]vian slave raids in the [[South Sea Islands]] to collect labor for the [[guano]] industry.

===Hawaii===
[[Ancient Hawaii]] was a [[caste|caste society]]. People were born into specific social classes. '''Kauwa''' were the outcast or slave class. They are believed to have been war captives, or the descendents of war captives. Marriage between higher castes and the kauwa was strictly forbidden. The kauwa worked for the chiefs and were often used as [[human sacrifice]]s at the ''[[luakini]] heiau''. (They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mythichawaii.com |url=http://www.mythichawaii.com/hawaiian-culture-society.htm |title=Kapu System and Caste System of Ancient Hawai'i |publisher=Mythichawaii.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] society of [[Aotearoa]], [[prisoners of war]] became ''taurekareka'', slaves, unless released, ransomed or tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |jstor=480764 |title=Maori Prisoners and Slaves in the Nineteenth Century }}&lt;/ref&gt; With some exceptions, the child of a slave remained a slave. As far as it is possible to tell, slavery seems to have increased in the early 19th century, as a result of increased numbers of prisoners being taken by Māori military leaders such as [[Hongi Hika]] and [[Te Rauparaha]] in the [[Musket Wars]], the need for labor to supply whalers and traders with food, flax and timber in return for western goods, and the missionary condemnation of [[cannibalism]]. Slavery was outlawed when the British annexed New Zealand in 1840, immediately prior to the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], although it did not end completely until government was effectively extended over the whole of the country with the defeat of the [[Māori King Movement|Kingi movement]] in the [[New Zealand Wars|Wars of the mid-1860s]].

===Chatham Islands===
One group of [[Polynesians]] who migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]] became the [[Moriori]] who developed a largely pacifist culture. It was originally speculated that they settled the Chathams direct from Polynesia, but it is now widely believed they were disaffected Māori who emigrated from the South Island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Rapa Nui / Easter Island===
The isolated island of [[Rapa Nui]]/[[Easter Island]] was inhabited by the [[Rapanui]], who suffered a series of slave raids from 1805 or earlier, culminating in a near [[genocide|genocidal]] experience in the 1860s. The 1805 raid was by American sealers and was one of a series that changed the attitude of the islanders to outside visitors, with reports in the 1820s and 1830s that all visitors received a hostile reception. In December 1862, [[Peru]]vian slave raiders took between 1,400 and 2,000 islanders back to Peru to work in the [[guano]] industry; this was about a third of the island's population and included much of the island's leadership, the last ''ariki-mau'' and possibly the last who could read [[Rongorongo]]. After intervention by the French ambassador in [[Lima]], the last 15 survivors were returned to the island, but brought with them [[smallpox]], which further devastated the island.

==Abolitionist movements==
{{Main|Abolitionism}}
[[File:Proclamation esclavage.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the abolition of slavery by [[Victor Hugues]] in the [[Guadeloupe]], 1 November 1794]]

Slavery has existed, in one form or another, throughout the whole of human history. So, too, have movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves. However, [[abolitionism]] should be distinguished from efforts to help a particular group of slaves, or to restrict one practice, such as the slave trade.

Drescher (2009) provides a model for the history of the abolition of slavery, emphasizing its origins in Western Europe. Around the year 1500, slavery had virtually died out in Western Europe, but was a normal phenomenon practically everywhere else. The imperial powers, France, Spain, Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands and a few others, built worldwide empires based primarily on plantation agriculture using slaves imported from Africa. However, the powers took care to minimize the presence of slavery in their homelands. During the &quot;Age of Revolutions&quot; (c. 1770–1815), Britain abolished its international slave trade and imposed similar restrictions upon other western nations; the U.S. followed suit in 1808. Although there were numerous slave revolts in the Caribbean, the only successful uprising came in the French colony of St. Domingue, where the slaves rose up, killed the mulattoes and whites, and established the independent Republic of Haiti. The continuing profitability of slave-based plantations and the threats of race war slowed the development of abolition movements during the first half of the 19th century. These movements were strongest in Britain, and after 1840 in the United States, in both instances they were based on evangelical religious enthusiasm that stressed the horrible impact on the slaves themselves. The Northern states of the United States abolished slavery, partly in response to the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804. Britain ended slavery in its empire in the 1830s. However the plantation economies of the southern United States, based on cotton, and those in Brazil and Cuba, based on sugar, expanded and grew even more profitable. The bloody [[American Civil War]] ended slavery in the United States in the 1860s; the system ended in Cuba and Brazil in the 1880s because it was no longer profitable for the owners. Slavery continued to exist in Africa, where Arab slave traders raided black areas for new captives to be sold in the system. European colonial rule and diplomatic pressure slowly put an end to the trade, and eventually to the practice of slavery itself.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
[[File:The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840 by Benjamin Robert Haydon.jpg|thumb|260px|A painting of the 1840 Anti-Slavery Conference.]]
In 1772, the '''[[Somersett's Case|Somersett Case]]''' ('''''R. v. Knowles, ex parte Somersett''''')&lt;ref&gt;(1772) 20 State Tr 1; (1772) Lofft 1&lt;/ref&gt; of the English [[Court of King's Bench]] ruled that [[slavery]] was unlawful in England (although not elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]). A similar case, that of [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]], took place in Scotland five years later and ruled slavery to be contrary to the law of Scotland.

Following the work of campaigners in the United Kingdom, such as William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on 25 March 1807, coming into effect the following year. The act imposed a fine of £100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to outlaw entirely the [[Atlantic slave trade]] within the whole British Empire.

The significance of the abolition of the British slave trade lay in the number of people hitherto sold and carried by British slave vessels. Britain shipped 2,532,300 Africans across the Atlantic, equalling 41% of the total transport of 6,132,900 individuals. This made the British empire the biggest slave-trade contributor in the world due to the magnitude of the empire. A fact that made the abolition act all the more damaging to the global trade of slaves.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Lovejoy: 'The Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade: A Synthesis.' ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 23, No. 4 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

The [[Slavery Abolition Act]], passed on 23 August 1833, outlawed slavery itself in the British colonies. On 1 August 1834 all slaves in the British West Indies, were emancipated, but still indentured to their former owners in an apprenticeship system. The intention of, was to educate former slaves to a trade but instead allowed slave owners to maintain ownership illegally. The act was finally repealed in 1838.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/thisday/2006/08/slavery-abolished-in-british-empire.php |title=This Day at Law: Slavery abolished in the British Empire |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |date=1 August 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Britain abolished slavery in both [[Hindu]] and [[Islam in India|Muslim India]] by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/bla1941111/ |title=Indian Legislation |publisher=Commonlii.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Domestic slavery practised by the educated African coastal elites (as well as interior traditional rulers) in [[Sierra Leone]] was abolished in 1928. A study found practices of domestic slavery still widespread in rural areas in the 1970s.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmintdev/923/923m21.htm |title=House of Commons – International Development – Memoranda |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1998227,00.html |title=Response The 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act didn't end the vile trade |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=25 January 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

===France===
There were slaves in mainland France (especially in trade ports such as Nantes or Bordeaux).,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordeaux and slaves&quot;&gt;[http://www.france-info.fr/spip.php?article290226&amp;var_recherche=mus%C3%A9e%20d%27aquitaine&amp;theme=9&amp;sous_theme=12 Bordeaux faces its slave history]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the institution was never officially authorized there. The legal case of [[Jean Boucaux]] in 1739 clarified the unclear legal position of possible slaves in France, and was followed by laws that established registers for slaves in mainland France, who were limited to a three-year stay, for visits or learning a trade. Unregistered &quot;slaves&quot; were regarded as free. However, slavery was of vital importance in France's [[Caribbean]] possessions, especially [[Saint-Domingue]]. In 1793, influenced by the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] of August 1789 and alarmed as the massive slave revolt of August 1791 that had become the [[Haitian Revolution]] threatened to ally itself with the British, the French Revolutionary commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] declared general emancipation to reconcile them with France. In Paris, on 4 February 1794, [[Abbé Grégoire]] and the [[Treaty|Convention]] ratified this action by officially abolishing slavery in all French territories outside mainland France, freeing all the slaves both for moral and security reasons.

[[Napoleon]] sent troops to the Caribbean in 1802 to try to re-establish slavery due to the economic stress France was suffering while fighting all over Europe. They succeeded in [[Guadeloupe]], but the ex-slaves of Saint-Domingue defeated the French corps that was sent and declared independence. This colony became Haiti, the first black republic, on 1 January 1804, with at its head the leader of the revolt, [[Toussaint Louverture]].&lt;ref name=Haiti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/earlyhaiti/dessalines.htm |title=A Brief History of Dessalines from 1825 Missionary Journal |publisher=Webster.edu |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in the French colonies was finally abolished only in 1849.

===United States===
In 1688, four German Quakers in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, PA|Germantown]] presented a [[The 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery|protest against the institution of slavery]] to their local Quaker Meeting. It was ignored for 150 years but in 1844 it was rediscovered and was popularized by the [[abolitionist movement]]. The 1688 Petition was the first American public document of its kind to protest slavery, and in addition was one of the first public documents to define universal human rights.

The [[American Colonization Society]], the primary vehicle for returning black Americans to greater freedom in Africa, established the colony of [[Liberia]] in 1821–22, on the premise former American slaves would have greater freedom and equality there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75 Background on conflict in Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS assisted in the movement of thousands of African Americans to Liberia, with its founder [[Henry Clay]] stating; &quot;unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off&quot;.  [[Abraham Lincoln]], an enthusiastic supporter of Clay, adopted his position on returning the blacks to their own land.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997).

Slaves in the United States who escaped ownership would often make their way to Canada via the &quot;[[Underground Railroad]]&quot;. The more famous of the African American [[abolitionists]] include former slaves [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Sojourner Truth]] and [[Frederick Douglass]]. Many more people who opposed slavery and worked for abolition were northern whites, such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Slavery was legally abolished in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

While abolitionists agreed on the evils of slavery, there were differing opinions on what should happen after African Americans were freed. By the time of Emancipation, African-Americans were now native to the United States and did not want to leave. Most believed that their labor had made the land theirs as well as that of the whites.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. G. Kelley and Earl Lewis, ''To Make Our World Anew: Volume I'' (2005) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress of Vienna===
The ''Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815'' (Which also formed ACT, No. XV. of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the &quot;principles of humanity and universal morality&quot; as justification for ending a trade that was &quot;odious in its continuance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time, Published by s.n., 1816 Volume 32. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPT24,M1 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century worldwide===
The [[1926 Slavery Convention]], an initiative of the [[League of Nations]], was a turning point in banning global slavery. Article 4 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[UN General Assembly]], explicitly banned slavery. The [[United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] was convened to outlaw and ban slavery worldwide, including child slavery. In December 1966, the UN General Assembly adopted the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which was developed from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 8 of this international treaty bans slavery. The treaty came into force in March 1976 after it had been ratified by 35 nations. As of November 2003, 104 nations had ratified the treaty.
According to the British Anti-Slavery Society, &quot;Although there is no longer any state which recognizes any claim by a person to a right of property over another, there are an estimated 27 million people throughout the world, mainly children, in conditions of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2005/issue3/0305p28.html |title=UN Chronicle &amp;#124;Slavery in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2010401.stm |title=BBC Millions 'forced into slavery' |publisher=BBC News  |date=27 May 2002 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downbound.com/Slavery_s/29.htm Slavery: Modern Slavery: Debt Bondage &amp; Slave Exploitation] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By MARGOT HORNBLOWER PARIS Sunday, 24 June 2001 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101930621-161939,00.html |title=The Skin Trade – TIME |work=Time  |date=24 June 2001 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
