{{History of Bahrain}}

'''Bahrain''' is an [[island country]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Although [[Bahrain]] became an independent country in 1971, the history of these islands starts from ancient times. Bahrain's strategic location in the Persian Gulf has brought rule and influence from the [[Sumerians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the [[Arab]]s, and the [[British Empire|British]].

==Ancient history==

Bahrain has been proposed as the possible site of  [[Dilmun]], a land mentioned by [[Mesopotamians]] as a trade partner, source of raw material, copper, and [[entrepot]] of the [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] trade route. The earliest mentioning of Dilmun is Mesopotamian sources was in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic III Period]], when [[Ur-Nanshe]] (circa 2520 BC) proclaimed that;
:&quot;''the ships of Dilmun, from the foreign land, brought him wood as a tribute''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=Curtis|title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society (Prehistoric Archeology and Ecology series)|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226469069|pages=33|url=http://books.google.com.bh/books?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=bahrain%20history&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=bahrain%20history&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the exact location of Dilmun is unclear, it might be associated with the islands of Bahrain, [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] of Saudi Arabia, [[Qatar]] and nearby [[Iran]]ian coast in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford&quot;&gt;''Dilmun and Its Gulf Neighbours'' by Harriet E. W. Crawford, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early settlements discovered in Bahrain suggests that Sennacherib, king of Assyria (707–681 BC) attacked northeast Arabia and captured the Bahrain islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;&gt;''Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography'' by Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th century BC to the 3rd century BC Bahrain was included in the [[Persian Empire]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;/&gt; Bahrain was referred to by the Greeks as &quot;[[Tylos]]&quot;, the centre of pearl trading, when [[Nearchus]] discovered it while serving under [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen&quot;&gt;''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient ...'' by Curtis E. Larsen p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; From the 3rd century BC to the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties, the [[Parthians]] and the [[Sassanids]]. By about 130 BC, the Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Research Division page 7&quot;&gt;''Bahrain'' by Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Asia in 600 CE, showing the Sassanid Empire before the Arab conquest.]]

In the 3rd century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the arrival of Islam four centuries later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Research Division page 7&quot;/&gt; [[Ardashir]], the first ruler of the Iranian Sassanid dynasty marched to Oman and Bahrain and defeated Sanatruq&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland, ''Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam'', Routledge 2001p28&lt;/ref&gt; (or Satiran&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;/&gt;), probably the Parthian governor of Bahrain.&lt;ref name = &quot;Jamsheed&quot;/&gt; He appointed his son [[Shapur I]] as governor of Bahrain. Shapur constructed a new city there and named it Batan Ardashir after his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;/&gt; At this time, Bahrain incorporated the southern Sassanid province covering the Persian Gulf's southern shore plus the archipelago of Bahrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamsheed&quot;&gt;Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in ... By Jamsheed K. Choksy, 1997, page 75&lt;/ref&gt; The southern province of the Sassanids was subdivided into three districts; Haggar (now al-Hafuf province, Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (now [[al-Qatif]] province, Saudi Arabia), and [[Mishmahig]] (now Bahrain Island)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojtahed-Zadeh&quot;/&gt; (In  [[Pahlavi language|Middle-Persian/Pahlavi]] it means &quot;ewe-fish&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
From the time when Islam emerged in the 7th century until the early 16th century, the name ''Bahrain'' referred to the wider [[Bahrain (historical region)|historical region of Bahrain]] stretching from [[Basrah]] to the [[Strait of Hormuz]] along the Persian Gulf coast. This was ''Iqlīm al-Baḥrayn'', i.e. the Province of Bahrain, and the Arab inhabitants of the province were descendants of the Arab tribe [[Bani Abd al-Qais]].

Bahrainis were amongst the first to embrace Islam. The [[Prophet Mohammed]] ruled Bahrain through one of his representatives, [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadhrami]]. Bahrain embraced Islam in 629 (the seventh year of hijra).  During the time of Umar I the famous companion of the Prophet, Abu Hurayrah, was the governor of Bahrain.  Umar I also appointed Uthman bin Abi Al Aas as governor of the area.  [[Al Khamis Mosque]], founded in 692, was one of the earliest [[mosque]]s built in Bahrain, in the era of [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]].

The expansion of Islam did not affect Bahrain's reliance on trade, and its prosperity continued to be dependent on markets in Mesopotamia. After [[Baghdad]] emerged as the seat of the [[caliph]] in 750 and the main centre of Islamic civilization, Bahrain greatly benefited from the city's increased demand for foreign goods especially from China and South Asia.

Bahrain became a principal centre of knowledge for hundreds of years stretching from the early days of Islam in the 6th century to the 18th century. Philosophers of Bahrain were highly esteemed, such as the 13th century mystic, Sheikh [[Maitham Al Bahrani]] (died in 1299). (The mosque of Sheikh Maitham and his tomb can be visited in the outskirts of the capital, [[Manama]], near the district of [[Mahooz]].).

==The Qarmatian Republic==
{{Main|Qarmatians}}
In the end of the 3rd [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] century, Abu Sa'id al-Hasan al-Janaby led the [[Revolution of al-Qaramita]], a rebellion by a [[messiah|messianic]] [[Ismaili]] sect originating in [[Kufa]] in present day Iraq. Al-Janaby took over the city of Hajr, Bahrain's capital at that time, and [[al-Hasa]], which he made the capital of his republic. Once in control of the state he sought to create a [[utopian]] society.

The Qarmatians' goal was to build a society based on reason and equality. The state was governed by a council of six with a chief who was a first among equals.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A History of Medieval Islam'', Routledge 1978 p130&lt;/ref&gt; All property within the community was distributed evenly among all initiates. The Qarmatians were organized as an [[esoteric]] society but not as a secret one; their activities were public and openly propagated, but new members had to undergo an initiation ceremony involving seven stages. The Qarmatian world view was one where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again.

Even before taking over Bahrain, the Qarmatians had instigated what some scholars have termed a 'century of terrorism' in Kufa.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.N. Al-Jubouri, Jubūrī, ''History of Islamic Philosophy'' Authors Online Ltd 2004, p172&lt;/ref&gt; From Bahrain they launched raids along the pilgrim routes crossing Arabia: in 906 they ambushed the pilgrim caravan returning from Mecca and massacred 20,000 pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, p130&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Abu Tahir Al-Jannabi]] they came close to capturing Baghdad in 923 and sacked Mecca in 930. In the assault on Islam's holiest sites, the Qarmatians desecrated the [[Zamzam Well|Well of Zamzam]] with corpses of Hajj pilgrims, and took the [[Black Stone]] from Mecca to Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ismaili.net/histoire/history05/history510.html The Qarmatians in Bahrain], Ismaili Net&lt;/ref&gt; The sack of Mecca followed [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] excitement among the Qarmatians (and in Persia) over the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 928. Bahrain became the seat of the Qarmatian Mahdi-Caliph from Isfahan who abolished [[Sharia|Sharīa]] law. The new Mahdi also changed the [[qibla]] of prayer from Mecca to that of fire, a specifically [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice. Some scholars take the view that &quot;they may not have been Isamailis at all at the outset, and their conduct and customs gave plausibility to the belief that they were not merely heretics but bitter enemies of Islam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saunders p130&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the 10th century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, controlling the coast of Oman, and collecting tribute from the [[Abbasid]] caliph in Baghdad and from the rival Ismaili [[Fatimid]] caliph in Cairo, whom they did not recognize. The land they ruled over was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash:

{{cquote|The Qarmatian state had vast fruit and grain estates both on the islands and in Hasa and Qatif. Nasiri Khusru, who visited Hasa in 1051, recounted that these estates were cultivated by some thirty thousand Ethiopian slaves. He mentions that the people of Hasa were exempt from taxes. Those impoverished or in debt could obtain a loan until they put their affairs in order. No interest was taken on loans, and token lead money was used for all local transactions. The Qarmathian state had a powerful and long-lasting legacy. This is evidenced by a coin known as Tawila, minted around 920 by one of the Qarmathian rulers, and which was still in circulation in Hasa early in the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Nakash, Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, Princeton 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Qarmatians were defeated in battle in 976 by the [[Abbasids]], which encouraged them to look inward to build their utilitarian society. Around 1058, a revolt on the island of Bahrain led by two Shi'a members of the Abd al-Qays tribe, [[Abu al-Bahlul al-Awwam|Abul-Bahlul al-'Awwam]] and Abu'l-Walid Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Daftary, ''The Ismāı̄lı̄s: Their History and Doctrines'', Cambridge University Press 1990, p221&lt;/ref&gt; precipitated the waning of Qarmatian power and eventually the ascendancy to power of the Uyunids, an Arab dynasty belonging to the [[Abdul Qays]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties: A Genealogical and Chronological Manual'', Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uyunid, Usfurid, and Jabrid dynasties==
The Uyunids ruled from 1076 to 1235, when the islands were briefly occupied by the Turkic Salgharid Atabeg of Fars. Supported by the Seljuk rulers of Iraq, the Uyunids relied on the power of the [[Banu 'Amir]] tribes such as the [[Banu Uqayl]].

In 1253, the [[Bahrani]] dynasty of the [[Usfurids]] of Banu Uqayl — named after its founder, Usfur ibn Rashid — gained control over eastern [[Arabia]], including the islands of Bahrain.  The late Middle Ages were a time of chronic instability with local disputes allowing various Persian-based Arab Kingdoms based in Qais, Qishm and Hormuz to involve themselves in Bahrain's affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1330, the islands became tributary to the rulers of [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]].&lt;ref&gt;Rentz, G. &quot;al- Baḥrayn.&quot; ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''.

Brill Online. 15 March 2008 [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0089]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Juan Cole]] it was under Sunni rule that [[Twelver|Twelver Shiaism]] became established in Bahrain, as Shia Bahrainis gradually moved away from the radical, egalitarian Ismaili Qarmatian sect to the more quietist Twelver or Imami branch, a process which the Sunni rulers encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, ''Sacred Space and Holy War'', IB Tauris, 2007 pp32&lt;/ref&gt;  But even in the 14th century, the North African traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] visiting Qatif around 1331, found it inhabited by Arabs whom he described as &quot;extremist Shi'is&quot; (rafidiyya [[ghulat]]), which Cole presumes is how a 14th century Sunni would describe Ismailis. Ibn Battuta also noted the great wealth of the area thanks to the pearling industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibn Battuta'', Rih1a Ibn Battuta Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1964 pp. 279–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late [[Middle Ages]], &quot;Bahrain&quot; referred to the larger [[Bahrain (historical region)|historical region of Bahrain]].  Ibn Battuta's 14th century account contains an early use of the term &quot;Bahrain&quot; to refer solely to the Awal islands.  However, the exact date at which the term &quot;Bahrain&quot; began to refer solely to the Awal archipelago is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rentz, G. al- Baḥrayn&quot;&gt;Rentz, G. &quot;al- Baḥrayn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-15th century, another branch of the Banu Uqayl, led by Zamil ibn Jabir, wrested control of Bahrain, founding the dynasty of the Bedouin [[Jabrids]]. Based in [[Al-Bahrain (historical region)|al-Ahsa]], the Jarbids ruled most of eastern Arabia and followed the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] rite, which they actively promoted within their domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rentz, G. al- Baḥrayn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rentz, G. &quot;DJABRIDS&quot;.

==Portuguese rule==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese expansion]] into the Indian Ocean in the early 16th century followed [[Vasco da Gama]]'s voyages of exploration in which the Portuguese battled the [[Ottomans]] up the coast of the Persian Gulf. Reputedly, the first Portuguese traveller to visit Bahrain was [[Duarte Barbosa]] in 1485.

The Arab navigator, [[Ahmad Bin Majid]], visited Bahrain in 1489 and gave a contemporary account of the country that the first Portuguese would have seen: &quot;In Awal (Bahrain) there are 360 villages and fresh water can be found in a number of places. A most wonderful al-Qasasir, where a man can dive into the salt sea with a skin and can fill it with fresh water while he is submerged in the salt water. Around Bahrain are pearl fisheries and a number of islands all of which have pearl fisheries and connected with this trade are 1,000 ships&quot;.

In 1521, a Portuguese force led by commander [[António Correia]] invaded Bahrain to take control of the wealth created by its pearl industry. The defeated [[King Muqrin]] was beheaded after Correia defeated his forces near present day Karbabad and took control of the fort &quot;[[Qala'at Al-Bahrain]]&quot;. The bleeding head of King Muqrin was later depicted on the Coat of Arms of António Correia.

The Portuguese ruled through force against the inhabitants for eighty years, until they were driven out of the island in 1602, when an uprising was sparked by the governor's order of the execution of the island's richest traders. The uprising coincided with regional disputes between the Portuguese and rival European powers. The power vacuum that resulted was almost immediately filled by the Persian ruler, [[Shah Abbas I]], who invaded the island and subsumed it within the [[Safavid Empire]].

==Safavid hegemony and the Beglarbegi of Kuhgilu==
Under Persian Safavid rule (1602–1717), Bahrain fell under the administrative jurisdiction of the Beglarbegi of Kuhgilu centered at [[Behbahan]] in southern Iran. In fact, the Safavids ruled Bahrain from a distance, seeking to control the islands not by force, but through ideology and the manipulation of local rivalries. Safavid rule was a period of intellectual flowering among the Shia [[ulema|theological elite]], with Bahrain's seminaries producing such theorists as Sheikh [[Yusuf Al Bahrani]]. The Safavid's used the clergy to buttress their rule, hoping that by firmly implanting Imami Shiaism they could secure the islands of Bahrain, with their centrality to trade routes and pearl wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, ''Sacred Space and Holy War'', IB Tauris, 2007 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Safavids' strategy was in many ways too successful: the power and influence of the religious class meant that they had a great deal of autonomy, and it was the subsequent tension between Safavid state and the clergy that drove Bahrain's theological vitality. Part of this flourishing was borne of the Bahraini clerics' adherence to conservative [[Akhbari]] Shiaism, while the Safavids encouraged the more state-centric, [[Usuli]]sm. Attempts by the Persians to reign in the Bahraini ulema were often counterproductive, and ended up strengthening the clerics against their local land-owning Bahraini rivals who challenged the clerics' control over the lucrative pearl trade. Cleric-landowner conflict was usually contained within very limited parameters given that the senior ulema were usually the sons of the land-owning class.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, ''Sacred Space and Holy War'', IB Tauris, 2007 p50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omani invasion and subsequent instability==
An Afghan invasion of Iran at the beginning of the 18th century resulted in the near collapse of the Safavid state. In the resultant power vacuum, [[1717 Omani invasion of Bahrain|Oman invade Bahrain in 1717]], ending over a hundred years of Persian hegemony. The Omani invasion began a period of political instability and a quick succession of outside rulers took power with consequent destruction. According to a contemporary account by theologian, Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani, in an unsuccessful attempt by the Persians and their Bedouin allies to take back Bahrain from the [[Kharijite]] Omanis, much of the country was burnt to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2c6004x0&amp;chunk.id=d0e7560&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e7560&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;query=Bahrain# Autobiography of Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani] published in ''Interpreting the Self, Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition'', Edited by Dwight F. Reynolds, University of California Press Berkeley 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrain was eventually sold back to the Persians by the Omanis, but the weakness of the Safavid empire saw [[Huwala]] tribes seize control.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Yūsuf al-Bahrānī (1696–1772) from Lu'lu'at al-Baḥrayn, from the final chapter [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2c6004x0&amp;chunk.id=d0e7560&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e7560&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;query=Bahrain#  An Account of the Life of the Author and the Events That Have Befallen Him] featured in ''Interpreting the Self, Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition'', Edited by Dwight F. Reynolds, University of California Press Berkeley 2001 p221&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730, the new Shah of Persia, [[Nadir Shah]], sought to re-assert Persian sovereignty in Bahrain, bring the island back under central rule and to challenge Oman in the Persian Gulf. He sought help from the British and Dutch, and he eventually recaptured Bahrain in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Belgrave, The Pirate Coast, G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1966 p19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1753, Bahrain was occupied by the Arabs of Abu Shahr of the [[Bushire]]-based Al Madhkur family&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Mustafa Abu Hakim, ''History of Eastern Arabia 1750–1800'', Khayat, 1960, p78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--unreliable source--&gt;, who ruled Bahrain in the name of Persia and paid allegiance to [[Karim Khan Zand]].

The years of almost constant warfare and instability in the period led to a demographic collapse – German geographer [[Carsten Niebuhr]] found in 1763 that Bahrain's 360 towns and villages had, through warfare and economic distress, been reduced to only 60.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, ''Sacred Space and Holy War'', IB Tauris, 2007 p52&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Iran was further undermined at the end of the 18th century when the ideological power struggle between the Akhbari-Usuli strands culminated in victory for the Usulis in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahrain.wikia.com/wiki/Are_the_Shia_Rising%3F Are the Shia Rising?] Maximilian Terhalle, ''Middle East Policy'', Volume 14 Issue 2 Page 73, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Al Khalifa and British Protectorate==
{{see also|1783 Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain}}
In 1782, war broke out between the Zubarah-based [[Bani Utbah]] tribe and the army of [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]], Ruler of Bahrain and Bushire.&lt;ref&gt;Arabian Gulf Intelligence: Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government No. XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosperity of [[Zubarah]], which is in modern Qatar, had brought it to the attention of the two main powers at the time, Persia and Oman,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jill Crystal p26&quot;&gt;Jill Crystal, ''Oil and Politics in the Gulf: Rulers and Merchants in Kuwait and Qatar'', Cambridge University Press 1995 p26&lt;/ref&gt; which were presumably sympathetic to Sheikh Nasr's ambitions. At the same time, Bahrain offered great potential wealth because of the extensive pearls found in its waters.
[[Image:AradFort.jpg|thumb|top|right|300px|A view of Arad Fort]]

In 1783, after defeat in the battle of [[Zubarah]], [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] lost the islands of Bahrain to the [[Bani Utbah]] tribe. 
In 1797, fourteen years later after gaining the power of the Bani Utbah, the Al Khalifa family moved to Bahrain and settled in [[Jaww]], later moving to [[Riffa]]. They were originally from Kuwait having left in 1766. Al-Sabah family traditions relates that the ancestors of their tribe and those of the Al-Khalifa tribe came to Kuwait after their expulsion from [[Umm Qasr]] upon Khor Zubair by the Turks, an earlier base from which they preyed on the caravans of Basra and pirated ships in the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia'', John Gordon Lorimer, Volume 1 Historical, Part 1, p1000, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The first ruler of the Al Khalifa was Shaikh [[Ahmed Al-Fateh]].

[[Image:RiffaFort2.jpg|thumb|top|right|200px|Inside Riffa Fort]]
In the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by the Omanis and by the [[Saudis|Al Sauds]]. In 1802 it was governed by a twelve-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as Governor in the [[Arad Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;James Onley, The Politics of Protection in the Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century, Exeter University, 2004 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaties with Britain===
In 1820, the Al Khalifa tribe regained power in Bahrain and entered a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|treaty relationship]] with [[Great Britain]], by then the dominant military power in the Persian Gulf. This treaty recognised the Al Khalifa as the rulers (&quot;Al-Hakim&quot; in Arabic) of Bahrain. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Baharna|first=Husain|title=Legal Status of the Arabian Gulf States: A Study of Their Treaty Relations and Their International Problems|year=1968|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719003326|pages=31|url=http://books.google.com.bh/books?id=BH27AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=first%20treaty%20Bahrain&amp;pg=PA31#v=snippet&amp;q=1820%20bahrain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of several treaties including the 1861 [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]], which was further revised in 1892 and 1951. 

This treaty was similar to those entered into by the British Government with the other Persian Gulf principalities. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly, the British promised to support the rule of the Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. According to [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] academic, Nelida Fuccaro, this treaty relationship with Britain was one aspect of an evolving polity:

{{cquote|From this perspective state building under the Al Khalifa shayks should not be considered exclusively as the result of Britain's informal empire in the Persian Gulf. In fact, it was a long process of strategic negotiation with different sections of the local population in order to establish a pre-eminence of their particularly artistic Sunni/Bedouin tradition of family rule.&lt;ref&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869–1937, in Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the Egyptian ruler, [[Mohammad Ali Pasha]] took the [[Arabian Peninsula]] from the [[Wahhabi]]s on behalf of the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Egyptian army demanded yearly tributes from  Sheikh Abdul Al Khalifa. He had earlier sought Persian and British protection from the Egyptians. &lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite book|last=Pridham|first=B.R.|title=New Arabian Studies, Volume 6|year=2004|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=0859897060|pages=51, 52, 53, 67, 68|url=http://books.google.com.bh/books?id=mu3tEPkVBpIC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Pasha%20Bahrain%20Egyptian&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=egypt%20bahrain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh agreed to the terms of the Egyptians. 

In 1860, the Government of Al Khalifa used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Sheikh Mohammad bin Khalifa Al Khalifa wrote letters to both the Persian Prince-Governor of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Wāli|Wali]] of [[Baghdad]], to place Bahrain in the protection of each respective state.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt; Both sides sent ''wakils'' (a person who is an authorised repesentative), who offered the Sheikh their conditions, of which the Ottoman terms were more beneficial and was accepted in March 1860.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt; In another letter to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammad demanded that the Government of Iran provide direct guidance and protection from British pressure. &lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

Later on, under pressure from Colonel Sir [[Lewis Pelly]], Sheikh Mohammad requested military assistance from Iran, but the Government of Iran at that time provided no aid to protect Bahrain from British aggression.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt; As a result the [[British Raj|Government of British India]] eventually overpowered Bahrain.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt; Colonel Pelly signed an agreement with Sheikh Mohammad in May 1861 and later with his brother Sheikh Ali that placed Bahrain under British rule and protection.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

In 1868, following the [[Qatari–Bahraini War]], British representatives signed [[Qatari–Bahraini_War#Background|another agreement]] with the Al Khalifa rulers, making Bahrain part of the British protectorate territories in the Persian Gulf. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pridham|first=B.

===Economic and social developments===
Peace and trade brought a new prosperity. Bahrain was no longer dependent upon pearling, and by the mid-19th century, it became the pre-eminent trading centre in the Persian Gulf, overtaking rivals Basra, Kuwait, and finally in the 1870s, Muscat.&lt;ref&gt;James Onley, The Politics of Protection in the Persian Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century, Exeter University, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Bahrain's socio-economic development began to diverge from the rest of the Persian Gulf: it transformed itself from a tribal trading centre in to a modern state.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p72&lt;/ref&gt; This process was spurred by the attraction of large numbers of Persian, Huwala, and Indian merchant families who set up businesses on the island, making it the nexus of a vast web of trade routes across the Persian Gulf, Persia and the Indian sub-continent. A contemporary account of [[Manama]] in 1862 found:

{{cquote|Mixed with the indigenous population [of Manamah] are numerous strangers and settlers, some of whom have been established here for many generations back, attracted from other lands by the profits of either commerce or the pearl fishery, and still retaining more or less the physiognomy and garb of their native countries. Thus the gay-coloured dress of the southern Persian, the saffron-stained vest of Oman, the white robe of Nejed, and the striped gown of Bagdad, are often to be seen mingling with the light garments of Bahreyn, its blue and red turban, its white silk-fringed cloth worn Banian fashion round the waist, and its frock-like overall; while a small but unmistakable colony of Indians, merchants by profession, and mainly from Guzerat, Cutch, and their vicinity, keep up here all their peculiarities of costume and manner, and live among the motley crowd, 'among them, but not of them'.

[[William Gifford Palgrave|WG Palgrave]], ''Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1862–3)''&lt;ref&gt;James Olney, Chapter &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' ed. Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Palgrave's description of Manama's coffee houses in the mid-19th century portrays them as cosmopolitan venues in contrast to what he describes as the 'closely knit and bigoted universe of central Arabia'.&lt;ref&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869–1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p39&lt;/ref&gt; Palgrave describes a people with an open – even urbane – outlook: &quot;Of religious controversy I have never heard one word. In short, instead of Zelators and fanatics, camel-drivers and Bedouins, we have at Bahrain [Manama] something like 'men of the world, who know the world like men' a great relief to the mind; certainly it was so to mine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gifford Palgrave|WG Palgrave]], ''Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1862–3)'' quoted in Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869–1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p39&lt;/ref&gt;

The great trading families that emerged during this period have been compared to the [[Borgias]] and [[Medicis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Raban]], ''[[Arabia through the Looking Glass]]'', William Collins &amp; Sons, 1979, p56&lt;/ref&gt; and their great wealth – long before the oil wealth for which the region would later be renowned – gave them extensive power, and among the most prominent were the Persian Al Safar family, who held the position of Native Agents of Britain in 19th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Nelida Fuccaro, &quot;Persians and the space in the city in Bahrain 1869–1937&quot;, in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' by Madawi Al-Rasheed Routledge 2005 p47&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Safar enjoyed an 'exceptionally close'&lt;ref&gt;James Olney, &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' ed. Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p71-2&lt;/ref&gt; relationship with the Al Khalifa clan from 1869, although the al-Khalifa never intermarried with them – it has been speculated that this could be related to political reasons (to limit the Safars' influence with the ruling family) and possibly for religious reasons (because the Safars were Shia).

As a result of Bahrain's trade with India, the cultural influence of the subcontinent grew dramatically, with styles of dress, cuisine, and education showing a marked Indian influence. According to Exeter University's James Onley &quot;In these and countless other ways, eastern Arabia's ports and people were as much a part of the Indian Ocean world as they were a part of the Arab world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Olney, Chapter &quot;Transnational merchants in the nineteenth-century Gulf: the case of the Safar family&quot; in ''Transnational Connections and the Arab Gulf'' ed. Madawi Al-Rasheed, Routledge, p78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century reforms===
Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain.&lt;ref name=Pirouz/&gt; Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Iranian relations. Sir [[Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representative in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in Bahrain from Mascat at this time.&lt;ref name=Pirouz/&gt; The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.&lt;ref name=Pirouz&gt;{{cite book|last=Mojtahed-Zadeh|first=Pirouz|title=Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0700710981|pages=130|url=http://books.google.com.bh/books?id=P4g6iRcZIKIC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=1895%20Bahrain%20March&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=1895%20Bahrain%20March&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain underwent a period of major social reform between 1926 and 1957, under the ''de facto'' rule of [[Charles Belgrave]], the British advisor to Shaikh [[Hamad ibn Isa Al-Khalifa (1872-1942)]]. The country's first modern school was established in 1919, with the opening of the Al-Hiddaya Boys School, while the Persian Gulf's first girls school opened in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain Education|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/bahrain.education.htm|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Mission Hospital, established by the [[Dutch Reform Church]], began work in 1903. Other reforms include the abolition of [[slavery]], while the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace.

These reforms were often vigorously opposed by powerful groups within Bahrain including sections within the ruling family, tribal forces, the religious authorities and merchants. In order to counter conservatives, the British removed the Ruler, [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]] in 1923 and replaced him with his son. Some Sunni tribes such as the [[Dawasir|al Dossari]] left Bahrain to mainland Arabia, whilst clerical opponents of social reforms were exiled to Saudi Arabia and Iran. The heads of some merchant and notable families were likewise exiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain's Re-Reform Movement|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67553/jane-kinninmont/bahrains-re-reform-movement|work=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's interest in Bahrain's development was motivated by concerns over the ambitions of the Saudi-Wahabi and the Iranians.

===Discovery of oil===
The discovery of oil in 1932 by [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1020.html|title=Bahrain: Discovery of Oil|date=January 1993|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought rapid modernisation to Bahrain. Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British [[Royal Navy]] moving its entire Middle Eastern command from [[Bushehr]] in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/bahrain.htm|title=Bahrain|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British influence continued to grow as the country developed, culminating with the appointment of [[Charles Belgrave]] as advisor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;[http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8], Cambridge Archive Editions: Bahrain&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish a modern education system in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;/&gt;

Bahrain [[Participants in World War II#Bahrain|participated]] in the [[Second World War]] on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side, joining on the 10th of September 1939. On the 19th of October 1940, four Italian [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.82|SM.82s]] bombers [[Bombing of Bahrain in World War II|bombed Bahrain]] alongside [[Dhahran]] oilfields in Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197604/air.raid.a.sequel.htm Italian Air Raid!]&lt;/ref&gt; targeting Allied-operated oil refineries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comandosupremo.com/manama.html Italian Raid on Manama 1940]&lt;/ref&gt; Although minimal damage was caused in both locations, the attack forced the Allies to upgrade Bahrain's defences which further stretched Allied military resources.  After World War II, increasing anti-British sentiment spread throughout the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The [[1947 Manama pogrom|riots]] focused on the Jewish community, which included distinguished writers, singers, accountants, engineers and middle managers working for the oil company, textile merchants with business all over the peninsula, and free professionals.

===The leftist movement===
{{Main|National Union Committee}}

[[Image:National Union Committee of Bahrain.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[National Union Committee]] members in 1954]]
The National Union Committee (NUC), a leftist nationalist movement associated with the labour unions, was formed in 1954 calling for the end of British interference and political reforms. Work sites were plagued with frequent strikes and occasional riots (including several fatalities) during this period. Following riots in support of [[Egypt]] defending itself against the tripartite invasion during 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the British decided to put an end to the NUC challenge to their presence in Bahrain. The NUC and its offshoots were declared illegal. Its leaders were arrested, tried and imprisoned. Some fled the country while others were forcibly deported.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Joyce.

Strikes and riots continued during the 1960s, now under the leadership of underground cells of the NUC, namely the [[communist]] [[National Liberation Front - Bahrain|National Liberation Front]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain]], the Bahraini section of the [[Arab Nationalist Movement]].

In March 1965, an uprising broke out, called the [[March Intifada]], against the British presence in Bahrain. The spark of the riots was the laying off of hundreds of Bahraini workers at the [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]]. Several people died in the sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police.

==Independent Bahrain==
After World War II, Bahrain became the centre for British administration of the lower Persian Gulf. In 1968, when the British Government announced its decision to end the treaty relationships with the Persian Gulf sheikdoms, Bahrain joined with [[Qatar]] and the seven Trucial States (which now form the [[United Arab Emirates]]) under British protection in an effort to form a union of Arab emirates. By mid-1971, however, the nine sheikhdoms still had not agreed on the terms of union. Accordingly, Bahrain sought independence as a separate entity declaring independence on 15 August 1971, and becoming formally independent as the State of Bahrain on 16 December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/817505.stm Bahrain Timeline] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LocationFederationofArabEmirates.png|thumb|The proposed [[federation]] of Arab emirates]]
At independence, the permanent Royal Navy presence in Bahrain ended and the [[United States Navy]] moved onto the 10 acres (40,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) previously occupied by British operations. The installation later grew into [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]], headquarters for the [[United States Fifth Fleet]].

The emirate emerged just as the price of oil skyrocketed after the [[1973 Arab-Israeli war]]; while Bahrain's own reserves were being depleted the high oil price meant there was massive capitalisation in the Kingdom's neighbours. The Kingdom was able to exploit the situation thanks to another war in the Levant in 1975: the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. [[Beirut]] had long been the financial centre of the Arab world, but the outbreak of hostilities in the country had an immediate impact on the banking industry. Bahrain offered a new location at the centre of the booming Persian Gulf with a large educated indigenous workforce and sound fiscal regulations. Realizing the opportunity to become a financial centre resulted in growth in other industry in the country.

This bolstered the development of the middle class and gives Bahrain a very different class structure from its tribal dominated neighbours. Although there had long been a large Indian presence in Bahrain, it was at this time that mass migration to the Kingdom began to take off with subsequent consequences for the Kingdom's demographics, as large numbers of third world immigrants from countries such as the [[Philippines]], Pakistan, [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]] were attracted by better salaries than at home.

===The constitutional experiment===
{{main|Politics of Bahrain}}
Based on its new [[Constitution of Bahrain|constitution]], Bahraini men elected its first [[National Assembly of Bahrain|National Assembly]] in 1973 (although Article 43 of the [[wikisource:Constitution of the State of Bahrain (1973)|1973 Constitution]] states that the Assembly is to be elected by &quot;[[universal suffrage]]&quot;, the conditional clause &quot;in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law&quot; allowed the regime to prevent women from participating). Although the Assembly and the then emir [[Isa ibn Salman al-Khalifa]] quarreled over a number of issues: foreign policy; the [[United States 5th Fleet|U.S. naval presence]], and the budget, the biggest clash came over the [[State Security Law of 1974|State Security Law]] (SSL). The Assembly refused to ratify the government-sponsored law, which allowed, among other things, the arrest and detention of people for up to three years, (renewable) without a trial. The legislative stalemate over this act created a public crisis, and on 25 August 1975, the emir dissolved the Assembly. The emir then ratified the State Security Law by decree, and suspended those articles in the constitution dealing with the legislative powers of the Assembly. In that same year, the emir established the [[State Security Court]], whose judgments were not subject to appeal.

===Iranian Revolution and social and political change===
The tide of [[Islamist|political Islam]] that swept the Middle East in the 1970s culminating in the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979 was to have profound implications for Bahrain's social and political development.

There were a number of factors that had caused Bahrain to be more liberal than its neighbours, but these were challenged by the zeitgeist of religious fundamentalism. Bahrain's pluralist traditions were to a large extent a result of the complex confessional and demographic make up of the state, which required [[Shias]], [[Sunnis]], Southern Persians (i.e. [[Huwala]] and [[Ajam (Bahrain)|Ajams]]) and a plethora of minority faiths to live and work together; this tolerance had been buttressed by the prominence of [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Marxism]] as the main modes of dissent, both of which were socially progressive and downplayed religious affiliations; while the country's traditional dependence on trade further encouraged openness.

Even before Iran's revolution in 1979, there was a noticeable conservative trend growing, with the traditional [[abaya]] being donned by women in preference to the then popular [[mini-skirt]]. But it was the political earthquake represented by the [[Shah]]'s fall that changed the dynamics of Bahrain's politics. 

In 1981 an alleged Iranian front organisation, the [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain]] attempted [[1981 failed coup in Bahrain|a coup d'état]] involving the assassination of Bahrain's leadership and an Islamist uprising with the aim of installing a theocracy with a cleric as supreme leader. The suspected coup and the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] led to the formation of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], which Bahrain joined with [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The sense of regional uncertainty was further heightened when [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait, triggering the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].

===1990s===
{{Main|1990s Uprising in Bahrain}}

Years of political stasis, the collapse of the price of oil, and growing frustration at the lack of democracy exploded into an uprising in 1994. While previous advocacy of reforms had been secular in character, the uprising was specifically Islamist, beginning with the stoning of female competitors in a marathon race for wearing 'inappropriate' clothing. There was also a strong sense of grievance due to perceived discrimination against the majority [[Shia]] population of Bahrain by the Al Khalifa rulers.

In the 1990s, a group consisting mainly of clerics and businessmen led by Islamist leader [[Abdul Amir Al Jamri]], drew up two petitions that were then signed by Shia, [[Sunni]] and secular [[nationalist]] individuals. They asked for reforms such as restoration of the [[National Assembly of Bahrain|National Assembly]] and the constitution of 1975, and participation by the population in decision making. To pre-empt the delivery of the petition to the emir, the regime arrested several of the leading Shia clerics who were organising the petition, including [[Ali Salman]].

The political impasse continued over the next few years during which time the regime dealt with its opponents using severe repression. Bomb attacks and police brutality marked this period in which over forty people were killed in violence between the two sides. Although the violence was never entirely stopped by the security measures, it was contained and continued as low-level intermittent disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meria.biu.ac.il/journal/1999/issue1/jv3n1a7.html|author=Adel Darwish|title=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 [[Shaykh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] became Emir after the death of his father, [[Shaykh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]], and carried out some social and political reforms.

===2000s===
{{Main|2000s in Bahrain}}

King Hamad tried to end the political repression that had defined the 1990s by scrapping security laws, releasing all political prisoners, instituting elections, giving women the vote and promising a return to constitutional rule. The move brought an end to political violence, but did not initially bring about a reconciliation between the government and most of the opposition groups, because the changes are seen as largely superficial and do not address the true issues facing Bahrainis today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
