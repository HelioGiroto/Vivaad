{{History of China|BC=1}}
The '''Sui Dynasty''' (589–618 CE)&lt;ref name=Yang/Gong/&gt; was a short-lived [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial Chinese]] dynasty. Preceded by the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], it unified China for the first time after over a century of north-south division. It was followed by the [[Tang Dynasty]].

Founded by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]], the Sui Dynasty capital was at [[Chang'an]] (which was renamed Daxing). His reign saw the reunification of Southern and Northern China and the construction of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]]. Emperors [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Wen]] and [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Yang]] undertook various reforms including the [[Equal-field system]], which was initiated to reduce the rich-poor social gap that resulted in enhanced agricultural productivity, as well as government centralisation and reforms, creating a new model of governance after centuries of division. The [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] system was officially instituted, [[Ancient Chinese coinage|coinage]] was standardized and re-unified, defense was improved and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] expanded. [[Buddhism]] was also spread and encouraged throughout the empire, uniting the varied peoples and cultures of China.

This dynasty has often been compared to the earlier [[Qin Dynasty]] in tenor and in the ruthlessness of its accomplishments. The Sui dynasty's early demise was attributed to the government's tyrannical demands on the people, who bore the crushing burden of taxes and compulsory labor. These resources were overstrained by the completion of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], a monumental engineering feat,&lt;ref&gt;CIHoCn, p.114 : « dug between 605 and 609 by means of enormous levies of conscripted labour ».&lt;/ref&gt; and in the undertaking of other construction projects, including the reconstruction of the Great Wall. Weakened by [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|costly and disastrous military campaigns]] against [[Goguryeo]] (in modern day Korea) which ended with the defeat of Sui in the early seventh century, the dynasty disintegrated through a combination of popular revolts, disloyalty, and assassination.

==History==
===Emperor Wen and the founding of the Sui Dynasty===
[[Image:China, 610.svg|thumb|left|Sui's China, and Sui divisions under Yangdi (western regions not depicted).]]
[[Image:SuiBodhisattva.JPG|thumb|left|Sui Dynasty [[Bodhisattva]], sandstone, Tianlongshan Grottoes, [[Shanxi]], 6th century.]]

When the [[Northern Zhou]] Dynasty defeated the [[Northern Qi]] Dynasty in 577 CE, this was the culminating moment and ultimate advantage for the northern Chinese to face south. The southern dynasties had lost hope in conquering the north, and the situation of conquest from north-to-south was only delayed in 523 with civil war.

The Sui Dynasty began when Emperor Wen's daughter became the Empress Dowager of Northern Zhou, with her stepson as the new emperor. After crushing an army disused in the eastern provinces as the prime minister of Zhou, Emperor Wen took the throne by force and proclaimed himself emperor. In a bloody purge, he had fifty-nine princes of the Zhou royal family eliminated yet nevertheless became known as the 'Cultured Emperor' (581 - 604 CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ebrey|first1=Patricia|last2=Walthall|first2=Ann|last3=Palais|first3=James|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-547-00534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Wen abolished the anti-Han policies of Zhou and reclaimed his Han surname of Yang. Having won the support of Confucian scholars who had powered previous Han dynasties (abandoning the nepotism and corruption of the [[nine-rank system]]), Emperor Wen initiated a series of reforms aimed at strengthening his empire for the wars that would reunify China.

In his campaign for southern conquest, Emperor Wen assembled thousands of boats to confront the naval forces of the [[Chen Dynasty]] on the [[Yangtze River]]. The largest of these ships were very tall, having five layered decks and the capacity for 800 passengers. They were outfitted with six 50-foot-long booms that were used to swing and damage enemy ships, or to pin them down so that Sui marine troops could use act-and-board techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides employing [[Xianbei]] and other Chinese ethnic groups for the fight against Chen, Emperor Wen also employed the service of aborigines from southeastern [[Sichuan]], a people that Sui had recently conquered.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;Page 89&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 588 CE, the Sui had amassed 518,000 troops along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, stretching from Sichuan to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷176|vol. 176]].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Chen Dynasty was collapsing and could not withstand such an assault. By 589 CE, Sui troops entered Jiankang ([[Nanjing]]) and the last emperor of the southern Chen dynasty surrendered. The city was razed to the ground, while Sui troops escorted Chen nobles back north, where the northern aristocrats became fascinated with everything the south had to provide culturally and intellectually.

Although Emperor Wen was famous for [[National bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the state treasury with warfare and construction projects, he made many improvements to infrastructure during his early reign. He established granaries as sources of food and as a means to regulate market prices from the taxation of crops, much like the earlier [[Han Dynasty]].

===Emperor Yang of Sui===

Emperor Yang of Sui gained the throne after his father's death, possibly by murder. He further extended the empire but unlike his father he did not seek to gain support from the nomads. Instead, he restored [[Confucianism|Confucian education]] and the [[Imperial examination|Confucian examination system]] for bureaucrats. By supporting educational reforms, he lost the support of the nomads. He also started many expensive construction projects such as the [[Grand Canal of China]], and became embroiled in several costly wars. Between these policies, invasions into China from Turkic nomads, and his growing life of decadent luxury at the expense of the peasantry, he lost public support and was eventually assassinated by his own ministers.

Both Emperors Wen and Yang sent military expeditions into [[Vietnam]] as [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] in northern Vietnam had been incorporated into the Chinese empire over 600 years earlier during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC - 220 CE). However the ancient Kingdom of [[Champa]] in southern Vietnam became a major counterpart to Chinese invasions to its north. According to Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais, these invasions became known as the Linyi-Champa Campaign (602-605 CE).&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;/&gt;

The [[Hanoi]] area formerly held by the Han and Jin dynasties was easily recovered from the local ruler in 602. A few years later the Sui army pushed farther south and was attacked by troops on [[war elephant]]s from [[Champa]] in southern Vietnam. The Sui army feigned retreat and dug pits to trap the elephants, lured the Champan troops to attack then used crossbows against the elephants causing them to turn around and trample their own soldiers. Although Sui troops were victorious many succumbed to disease as northern soldiers did not have immunity to [[tropical]] [[disease]]s such as [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;Page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goguryeo-Sui wars===
{{Main|Goguryeo-Sui Wars}}
The biggest factor that led to the downfall of Sui Dynasty was a series of massive expeditions into the [[Korean Peninsula]] to invade [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. The Sui Dynasty's second emperor, Emperor Yang conscripted many soldiers for the campaign. This army was so enormous it recorded in historical texts that it took 30 days for all the armies to exit their last rallying point near [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] before invading Korea. In one instance the soldiers&amp;mdash;both conscripted and paid&amp;mdash;listed over 3000 warships, up to 1.15 million infantry, 50,000 cavalry, 5000 artillery, and more.  There were as many supporting laborers and an exorbitant military budget that included mounds of equipment and rations (most of which never reached the Chinese vanguard, as they were captured by Goguryeo armies already).  The army stretched to 1000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' or about 410 kilometers across rivers and valleys, over mountains and hills.

In all four main campaigns, the military conquest ended in failure. Many Sui soldiers were defeated by the prominent army leader [[Eulji Mundeok]] of Goguryeo - in prominent battles such as The [[Battle of Salsu]] River. According to the [[Book of Tang]], of the 305,000 Chinese troops, only 2,700 returned to China (although the Tang was known to have exaggerated the failures of their predecessors to justify their own rule).

===Fall===

The P-shaped scabbard mount of the bottom sword is said to be derived from the swords of the [[Sarmatians]] and [[Sassanians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] permanent exhibit notice.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One great accomplishment was rebuilding the [[Great Wall of China]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, but this, along with other large projects, strained the economy and angered the resentful workforce employed. During the last few years of the Sui Dynasty, the rebellion that rose against it took many of China's able-bodied men from rural farms and other occupations, which in turn damaged the agricultural base and the economy further.&lt;ref name=&quot;benn 2&quot;&gt;Benn, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Men would deliberately break their limbs in order to avoid military [[conscription]], calling the practice &quot;propitious paws&quot; and &quot;fortunate feet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;benn 2&quot;/&gt; In the year 642, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] made an effort to eradicate this practice by issuing a decree of a stiffer punishment for those who were found to deliberately injure and heal themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;benn 2&quot;/&gt;

Although the Sui Dynasty was relatively short (581-618 CE), much was accomplished during its tenure. The Grand Canal was one of the main accomplishments. It was extended north from the Hangzhou region across the Yangzi to Yangzhou and then northwest to the region of Luoyang. The eventual fall of the Sui dynasty was due to the many losses in Southern Manchuria and North Korea. It was after these defeats and losses that the country was left in ruins and rebels soon took control of the government. Emperor Yang was assassinated in 618. I had gone South after being defeated by Korea and was killed by his advisors. Meanwhile, in the North, aristocrat Li Yuan (李淵) held an uprising after which he ended up ascending the throne to become [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang]]. This was the start of the [[Tang Dynasty]], one of the most-noted dynasties in Chinese history.

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Stroll About InSpring.jpg|thumb|left|''Strolling About in Spring'', by [[Zhan Ziqian]], Sui era artist.]]
[[Buddhism]] was popular during the [[Six Dynasties]] period that preceded the Sui dynasty, spreading from India through [[Kushan]] Afghanistan into China during the Late [[Han Dynasty|Han]] period. Buddhism gained prominence during the period when central political control was limited. Buddhism created a unifying cultural force that uplifted the people out of war and into the Sui Dynasty. In many ways, Buddhism was responsible for the rebirth of culture in China under the Sui Dynasty.

Emperor Wen and his empress had converted to Buddhism to legitimize imperial authority over China and the conquest of Chen. The emperor presented himself as a [[Cakravartin]] king, a Buddhist monarch who would use military force to defend the Buddhist faith. In the year 601 CE, Emperor Wen had relics of the Buddha distributed to temples throughout China, with edicts that expressed his goals, &quot;all the people within the four seas may, without exception, develop enlightenment and together cultivate fortunate karma, bringing it to pass that present existences will lead to happy future lives, that the sustained creation of good causation will carry us one and all up to wondrous enlightenment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;Page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this act was an imitation of the ancient [[Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]] of [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWP&quot;&gt;Page 89&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

After news of Emperor Yang's death in 618 reached Daxing and the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], Li Yuan deposed Emperor Gong and took the throne himself, establishing [[Tang Dynasty]], but the Sui officials at Luoyang declared Emperor Gong's brother [[Yang Tong]] (later also known as Emperor Gong during the brief reign of [[Wang Shichong]] over the region as the emperor of a brief Zheng (鄭) state) emperor.  Meanwhile, [[Yuwen Huaji]], the general under whose leadership the plot to kill Emperor Yang was carried out, declared Emperor Wen's grandson [[Yang Hao (Sui Dynasty)|Yang Hao]] emperor but killed Yang Hao later in 618 and declared himself emperor of a brief Xu (許) state.  As Yang Hao was completely under Yuwen's control and only &quot;reigned&quot; briefly, he is not usually regarded as a legitimate emperor of Sui, while Yang Tong's legitimacy is more recognized by historians but still disputed.&lt;/ref&gt;  || Dàyè (大業) 605-618
