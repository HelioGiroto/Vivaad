{{History of Scotland}}

[[Scotland]] was first decisively settled after the end of the [[Wisconsinan glaciation|last glacial period]] (in the [[paleolithic]]), roughly 10,000 years ago.  [[Prehistoric Scotland]] entered the Neolithic about 4000 BC, the Bronze Age about 2000 BC, and the Iron Age around 700 BC. The recorded '''history of Scotland''' begins with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century, the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] reached as far north as the [[Antonine Wall]], which once ran from the Clyde to the Forth.  To the north lay the territory of the [[Caledonia]], by name whose people were described as &quot;[[Picts|Picti]]&quot;, in Latin, meaning ‘painted ones’. Due to constant incursions from these Picti the Roman legions would be forced back to [[Hadrian's Wall]] within 20 years of its construction, and forced to abandon the territory by the beginning of the 3rd Century. 

During the 5th century the North West (North of the Antonine Wall and West of the Grampian mountains) is believed to have been raided and latter settled by [[Gaels]] / [[Scoti]] originating from Northern Ireland. These raiders would later found the Kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] in the West. In the following century an Irish missionary Columba would found a monastery, on Iona, and introduce the previously pagan Scotti to [[Celtic church|Celtic Christianity]], and with less success the Picts of Pictland. King Nechtan of Pictland would later choose to expel the Columban church in favour of the Roman, principally to restrict the influence of the Scoti on his kingdom and to avoid a war with Northumbria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/sysm/scots/teachers/background.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period Angles had conquered the previously [[Brythonic]] territory south of the Clyde and Forth, initially creating the Anglo Saxon kingdom of [[Bernicia]], later becoming a part of the Kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. Towards the end of the 8th century all three kingdoms would be raided, settled and to some extent come under [[Viking]] control. Successive defeats by the Norse would force the Picts and Scoti to cease their historic hostility to each other and unite in the 9th Century, to form the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].  In the 12th century [[David I of Scotland|David I]], Prince of Cumbria and Earl of Northampton and Huntingdon would conquer, with the backing of [[Henry I of England]] and a number of English Barons, including a [[Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale|Robert Bruce]] and [[Walter fitz Alan]] (Stewart / Stuart), the majority of mainland Scotland. In exchange for land these Anglo-Norman Barons would help David secure his claim to the throne and feudalise much of Scotland.  Following the Battle of Largs, the 13th century would see the Norse settlement and overlordship of Scotland end, as well as the line of David I, with the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]. The subsequent century would see conflict with England and the throne of Scotland passing through the Houses of Balliol and Bruce to the [[House of Stuart]], along with the arrival of the [[Black death]].

The [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] of 1707  united Scotland with England into a new sovereign state called [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], after 1801 known as the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp The Union of the Parliaments 1707] [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]]. Retrieved 2 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Union with England Act 1707, Article II.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last Stuart monarch, ruling until 1714. Since 1714, the succession of the [[British monarchs]] of the houses of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Windsor)]] has been due to their descent from [[James VI and I]] of the House of Stuart.

During the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Its industrial decline following the [[World War II|Second World War]] was particularly acute, but in recent decades the country has enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent [[financial services]] sector, the proceeds of [[North Sea oil]] and gas, and latterly a [[Scottish Parliament|devolved parliament]].

==Prehistory==
{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}
[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest standing house in Northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], dating from 3500 BC.]]
People lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before recorded history dealt with Britain. At times during the last [[Ice age|interglacial period]] (130,000– 70,000 BC) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have made their way to Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Francis. ''Britain B.C.: life in Britain and Ireland before the Romans''. 99: Harper Collins, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherer encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] to around 8500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7992300.stm |title=Signs of Earliest Scots Unearthed |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Ashmore, ''Neolithic and Bronze Age Scotland: An authoritative and Lively Account of an Enigmatic Period of Scottish Prehistory'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neolithic]] farming brought permanent settlements, and the wonderfully well-preserved stone house at [[Knap of Howar]] on [[Papa Westray]] dating from 3500 BC predates by about 500 years the village of similar houses at [[Skara Brae]] on West [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]], [[Orkney]]. The settlers introduced [[chambered cairn]] tombs from around 3500 BC ([[Maeshowe]] offers a prime example), and from about 3000 BC the many standing stones and circles such as the [[Ring of Brodgar]] on Orkney and [[Callanish]] on [[Lewis]]. These form part of the Europe-wide [[Megalithic]] culture which also produced [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], and which pre-historians now interpret as showing sophisticated use of astronomical observations.

The cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into the [[Bronze age]], and [[hill fort]]s started to appear, such as [[Eildon Hill]] near Melrose in the [[Scottish Borders]], which goes back to around 1000 BC and which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop.

[[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] [[Celt]]ic culture and language spread into Scotland at some time after the 8th century BC, possibly through cultural contact rather than through mass invasion,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and systems of kingdoms developed.

From around 700 BC the [[Iron age]] brought numerous [[hill fort]]s, [[broch]]s and fortified settlements which support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms later recorded by the Romans, though evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic [[power (sociology)|power]] had as much significance as warfare.

==Roman invasion==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
{{Main|Scotland during the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Bridgeness slab detail.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Roman cavalryman trampling conquered Picts, National Museum of Scotland]]
The only surviving pre-Roman account of Scotland originated with the [[Ethnic Greek|Greek]] [[Pytheas|Pytheas of Massalia]] who circumnavigated the [[British Isles|British]] islands (which he called ''Pretaniké'') in 325 BC, but the record of his visit dates from much later.

The [[Roman invasion of Britain]] began in earnest in AD 43. Following a series of military successes in the south, forces led by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] entered Scotland in 79.  The Romans met with fierce resistance from the local population of [[Caledonia]]ns. In 82 or 83 Agricola sent a fleet of galleys up round the coast of Scotland, as far as the [[Orkney Islands]]. In 84 the Caledonian tribes, led by [[Calgacus]] (known as &quot;the swordsman&quot;), were defeated at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]] by the Romans' superior tactics and use of professional troops.

The only historical source for this comes from the writings of Agricola's son-in-law, [[Tacitus]]. Archaeology backed up with accurate dating from [[dendrochronology]] suggests that the occupation of southern Scotland started before the arrival of Agricola. Whatever the exact dating, for the next 300 years Rome had some presence along the southern border.

Although the Romans had failed to conquer [[Caledonia]] they attempted to maintain control through military outposts and built a few roads. They were eventually forced or chose to withdraw, concluding that the wealth of the land did not justify the extensive garrisoning requirements.

==Post-Roman Scotland==
{{Main|Scotland in the Early Middle Ages}}
[[File:Pictish stone strathpeffer eagle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clach an Tiompain]], a Pictish symbol stone in [[Strathpeffer]]]]
In the centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, there were four groups within the borders of what is now Scotland. In the east were the [[Picts]], with kingdoms between the river Forth and Shetland. In the late 6th century the dominant force was the Kingdom of [[Fortriu]], whose lands were centred on [[Strathearn]] and [[Menteith]] and who raided along the eastern coast into modern England.&lt;ref name=Smyth1989pp43-6/&gt; In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]] with their royal fortress at [[Dunadd]] in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from which they brought with them the name Scots.&lt;ref name=Smyth1989pp43-6&gt;A. P. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1989), pp. 43-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the south was the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]) [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], descendants of the peoples of the Roman influenced kingdoms of &quot;[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]&quot;, often named Alt Clut, the Brythonic name for their capital at [[Dumbarton Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Macquarrie, &quot;The kings of Strathclyde, c. 400-1018&quot;, in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, ''Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there were the English or &quot;Angles&quot;, Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]], in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, ''The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell'' (Continuum, 2000), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The first English king in the historical record is [[Ida of Bernicia|Ida]], who is said to have obtained the throne and the kingdom about 547.&lt;ref&gt;B. Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (Routledge, 2002), pp. 75-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ida’s grandson, Æthelfrith, united his kingdom with [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] to the south to form Northumbria around the year 604. There were changes of dynasty, and the kingdom was divided, but it was re-united under Æthelfrith's son [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] (r. 634-42).&lt;ref&gt;B. Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland was largely converted to Christianity by Irish-Scots missions associated with figures such as [[St Columba]], from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions tended to found [[monastery|monastic]] institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas.&lt;ref&gt;O. Clancy, &quot;The Scottish provenance of the ‘Nennian’ recension of Historia Brittonum and the Lebor Bretnach &quot; in: S. Taylor (ed.), ''Picts, Kings, Saints and Chronicles: A Festschrift for Marjorie O. Anderson'' (Four Courts, 2000), pp. 95–6 and A. P. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1989), pp. 82–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a result of these factors, some scholars have identified a distinctive form of [[Celtic Christianity]], in which [[abbot]]s were more significant than [[bishop]]s, attitudes to [[clerical celibacy]] were more relaxed and there was some significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of [[tonsure]] and the method of [[Computus|calculating Easter]], although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century.&lt;ref name=Evans1985&gt;C. Evans, &quot;The Celtic Church in Anglo-Saxon times&quot;, in J. D. Woods, D. A. E. Pelteret, ''The Anglo-Saxons, synthesis and achievement'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1985), pp. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Corning, ''The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church'' (Macmillan, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of the kingdom of Alba==
{{Main|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba}}
Conversion to Christianity may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of Dál Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cínaed mac Ailpín]] (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the [[House of Alpin]].&lt;ref name=Yorke2006p54&gt;B. Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600-800'' (Pearson Education, 2006), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 867 the Vikings seized the soutern half of Northumbria, forming the [[Kingdom of York]];&lt;ref name=Rollason2003p212&gt;D. W. Rollason, ''Northumbria, 500-1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; three years later they stormed the Britons’ fortress of Dumbarton&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Snyder, ''The Britons'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced kingdom of Wessex,&lt;ref name=Rollason2003p212/&gt; leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hearn, ''Claiming Scotland: National Identity and Liberal Culture'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900, [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall II]] (Donald II) was the first man to be called ''rí Alban'' (i.e. ''King of Alba'').&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Anderson, ''Early Sources of Scottish History, A.D. 500 to 1286'' (General Books LLC, 2010), , vol. i, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Scotia would be increasingly be used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings would be referred to as Scotland.&lt;ref name=Webster1997p22&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scotland from the Matthew Paris map, c.1250.jpg|thumb|left|Scotland from the Matthew Paris map, c. 1250.]]
The long reign (900–942/3) of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Causantín]] (Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at [[Brunanburh]] was followed by his retirement as a [[Culdee]] monk at St. Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;A. Woolf, ''From Pictland to Alba: 789 - 1070'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The period between the accession of his successor [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Máel Coluim I]] (Malcolm I) and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II) was marked by good relations with the [[Wessex]] [[Kings of England|rulers of England]], intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] as part of a deal with King [[Edmund I of England|Edmund of England]], where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century,&lt;ref&gt;B. T. Hudson, ''Kings of Celtic Scotland'' (Greenhill, 1994), pp. 95–6.&lt;/ref&gt; an event offset somewhat by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King [[Duncan I of Scotland|Donnchad I]] (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the [[Mormaer of Moray]], who became king in 1040.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, ''Kings of Celtic Scotland'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; MacBeth ruled for seventeen years before he was overthrown by [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim]], the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's [[Stepfamily|step-son]] and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III).&lt;ref name=Mackie43&gt;J. D. Mackie, ''A History of Scotland'' (Pelican, 1964), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was Máel Coluim III, who acquired the nickname &quot;Canmore&quot; (''Cenn Mór'', &quot;Great Chief&quot;), which he passed to his successors and who did most to create the [[House of Dunkeld|Dunkeld dynasty]] that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Particularly important was his second marriage to the Anglo-Hungarian princess [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]].&lt;ref&gt;A. A. M. Duncan, ''Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1'' (Mercat Press,1989), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage, and raids on northern England, prompted [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] to invade and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, opening up Scotland to later claims of sovereignty by English kings.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, ''Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; When Malcolm died in 1093, his brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Domnall III]] (Donald III) succeeded him. However, [[William II of England]] backed Máel Coluim's son by his first marriage, [[Duncan II|Donnchad]], as a pretender to the throne and he seized power. His murder within a few months saw Domnall restored with one of Máel Coluim sons by his second marriage, [[Edmund of Scotland|Edmund]], as his heir. The two ruled Scotland until two of Edmund's younger brothers returned from exile in England, again with English military backing. Victorious, [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], the oldest of the three, became king in 1097.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp23-4&gt;Webster, ''Medieval Scotland'', pp. 23-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Edgar and the King of Norway, [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Bare Legs]] concluded a treaty recognizing Norwegian authority over the Western Isles. In practice Norse control of the Isles was loose, with local chiefs enjoying a high degree of independence. He was succeeded by his brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander]], who reigned 1107–24.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forte, R. D. Oram and F. Pedersen, ''Viking Empires'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander III and Edward I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] as a guest of his brother-in-law [[Edward I]] at the sitting of an English parliament]]
When Alexander died in 1124, the crown passed to Margaret's fourth son [[David I of Scotland|David I]], who had spent most of his life as an English baron. His reign saw what has been characterised as a  &quot;[[Davidian Revolution]]&quot;, by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones, underpinning the development of later Medieval Scotland.&lt;ref name=Barrow1992pp9-11&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, &quot;David I of Scotland: The Balance of New and Old&quot;, in G. W. S. Barrow, ed., ''Scotland and Its Neighbours in the Middle Ages'', (London, 1992), pp. 9&amp;ndash;11 pp. 9&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (Random House, 2011), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of [[feudalism|feudal]] land tenure, which produced [[knight service]], castles and an available body of heavily armed cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of [[justicar]] to oversee justice, and local offices of [[sheriffs]] to administer localities. He established the first [[royal burgh]]s in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He was continued a process begun by his mother and brothers  helping to establish foundations who brought reform to Scottish monasticism based on those at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] and he played a part in the organisation of diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp29-37&gt;Webster, ''Medieval Scotland'', pp. 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] and [[William I of Scotland|William I]], with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp23-4/&gt; The benefits of greater authority were reaped by William's son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and his son [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]]'s ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the [[Battle of Largs]] with the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.&lt;ref name=Macquarrie2004p153&gt;A. Macquarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Sutton, 2004), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wars of Independence==
{{Main|Wars of Scottish Independence}}
The death of king [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in 1286, and the death of his granddaughter and heir [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked [[Edward I of England]] to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing [[John Balliol]], the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale]], the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the [[Auld Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Macdougall, ''An Antidote to the English: the Auld Alliance, 1295-1560'' (Tuckwell Press, 2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Edward I of England, Malleus Scotorum ('Hammer of the Scots').tiff|thumb|upright|left|Edward I of England, 'Hammer Of The Scots', depicted on a late-15thC woodcut.]]
In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew de Moray]] raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 43-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England.&lt;ref&gt;A. Tuck, ''Crown and Nobility: England 1272-1461'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd edn., 1999), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

W. S. Barrow, ''Robert Bruce'' (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward I had died in 1307. His heir [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] moved an army north to break the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] and reassert control. Robert defeated that army at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, securing ''de facto'' independence.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brown, ''Bannockburn: the Scottish War and the British Isles, 1307-1323'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1320 the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a remonstrance to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince [[Pope John XXII]] to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The Declaration has also been seen as one of the most important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brown, ''The Wars of Scotland, 1214-1371'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2004), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1326, what may have been the first full [[Parliament of Scotland]] met. The parliament had evolved from an earlier council of nobility and clergy, the ''colloquium'', constituted around 1235, but perhaps in 1326 representatives of the [[burgh]]s — the burgh commissioners — joined them to form the [[Three Estates]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan R.

==The Stewarts==
{{Main|House of Stuart}}
[[File:Armorial depiction of the King of Scots.jpg|thumb|right|Heraldic depiction of the King of Scots from a 15thC French armorial.]]
After David II's death, [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]], the first of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was followed in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the [[regnal name]] [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]]. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]].&lt;ref name=Rigby2003&gt;S. H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003),  pp. 301-2.&lt;/ref&gt; After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future [[James I of Scotland|James I]], sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son [[Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany|Murdoch]]. When Scotland finally paid the ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, returned with his English bride determined to assert this authority.&lt;ref name=Rigby2003/&gt;  Several of the Albany family were executed, but he succeeded in centralising control in the hands of the crown, at the cost of increasingly unpopularity and was assassinated in 1437. His son [[James II of Scotland|James II]] (reigned 1437–1460), when he came of age in 1449, continued his father's policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful [[House of Douglas|Black Douglas family]] that had come to prominence at the time of the Bruce.&lt;ref name=Rigby2003/&gt;

In 1468 the last significant acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when [[James III of Scotland|James III]] married [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]], receiving the [[Orkney Islands]] and the [[Shetland Islands]] in payment of her dowry.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1991),  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berwick upon Tweed]] was [[capture of Berwick (1482)|captured by England in 1482]]. With the death of James III in 1488 at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]], his successor [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] successfully ended the quasi-independent rule of the [[Lord of the Isles]], bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time.&lt;ref name=Rigby2003/&gt; In 1503, he married [[Margaret Tudor]], daughter of [[Henry VII of England]], thus laying the foundation for the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Mason, ''Scots and Britons: Scottish political thought and the union of 1603'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during the fifteenth century with the founding of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1413, the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1450 and the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1495, and with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (DS Brewer, 2006), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; James IV's reign is often considered to have seen a flowering of Scottish culture under the influence of the European [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-formed, 1488-1587'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2007), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Edinburgh from the Palace block of Edinburgh Castle.jpg|thumb|240px|left|View from the royal apartments of the Stewart monarchs, Edinburgh Castle.]]
In 1512 the Auld Alliance was renewed and under its terms, when the French were attacked by the English under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], James IV invaded England in support. The invasion was stopped decisively at the [[Battle of Flodden Field]] during which the King, many of his nobles, and  a large number of ordinary troops were killed, commemorated by the song ''[[Flowers of the Forest]]''. Once again Scotland's government lay in the hands of regents in the name of the infant [[James V of Scotland|James V]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Menzies ''The Scottish Nation'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2002), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[James V of Scotland|James V]] finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents with the aid of his redoubtable mother in 1528, he once again set about subduing the rebellious Highlands, Western and Northern isles, as his father had had to do. He married the French noblewoman [[Marie de Guise]]. His reign was fairly successful, until another disastrous campaign against England led to defeat at the [[battle of Solway Moss]] (1542). James died a short time later. The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who became [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. James is supposed to have remarked in [[Scots language|Scots]] that ''&quot;it cam wi a lass, it will gang wi a lass&quot;'' – referring to the House of Stewart which began with Walter Stewart's marriage to the daughter of Robert the Bruce. 

Once again, Scotland was in the hands of a regent. Within two years, the [[Rough Wooing]] began, Henry VIII's military attempt to force a marriage between Mary and his son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. This took the form of border skirmishing and several English campaigns into Scotland. In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, forces under the English regent [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] were victorious at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], the climax of the Rough Wooing, and followed up by the occupation of [[Siege of Haddington|Haddington]]. Mary was then sent to France at the age of five, as the intended bride of the heir to the French throne. Her mother, Marie de Guise, stayed in Scotland to look after the interests of Mary — and of France — although the [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] acted officially as regent.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, ''Scotland Re-formed, 1488-1587''&lt;/ref&gt; Guise responded by calling on French troops, who helped stiffen resistance to the English occupation. By 1550, after a change of regent in England, the English withdrew from Scotland completely.

From 1554, Marie de Guise, took over the regency, and continued to advance French interests in Scotland. French cultural influence resulted in a large influx of French vocabulary into [[Scots language|Scots]]. But anti-French sentiment also grew, particularly among [[Protestant]]s, who saw the English as their natural allies. In 1560 Marie de Guise died, and soon after the Auld Alliance also died, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]], which provided for the removal of French and English troops from Scotland. The [[Scottish Reformation]] took place only days later when the [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Scottish Parliament]] abolished the [[Roman Catholic]] religion and outlawed the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

[[File:The murder of David Rizzio from the Duke of Buccleuch statue.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Rizzio's murder in 1566]]
Meanwhile, Queen Mary had been raised a Catholic in France.&lt;ref&gt;Retha M. Warnicke, ''Mary Queen of Scots'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; She had married the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] [[Francis II of France|Francis]] in 1558, and become Queen of France on the death of his father the following year. When Francis himself died, Mary, now nineteen, elected to return to Scotland to take up the government in a hostile environment. Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to reimpose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, [[David Riccio]], was followed by the murder of her unpopular husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], and her abduction by and marriage to the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]]. Captured by Bothwell's rivals, Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], and in July 1567, was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son [[James VI and I|James VI]]. Mary eventually escaped from Loch Leven, and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the [[Battle of Langside]] in 1568 she took refuge in England, leaving her young son in the hands of regents. In Scotland the Regents fought a [[Edinburgh Castle#16th century and the Lang Siege|civil war]] on behalf of James VI against his mother's supporters. In England Mary became a focal point for Catholic conspirators and was eventually tried for treason and executed on the orders of her kinswoman [[Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''Mary Queen of Scots'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant Reformation==
{{Main|Scottish Reformation}}
[[File:John Knox, Protestant reformer.jpg|thumb|120px|left|In 1559 [[John Knox]] returned from ministering in [[Geneva]] to lead the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] reformation in Scotland]]
During the 16th century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that made the nation Calvinist, with a strong Presbyterian Church. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland. The execution of a number of Protestant preachers, most notably the Lutheran influenced [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] in 1528 and later the proto-Calvinist [[George Wishart]] in 1546 who was burnt at the stake in St. Andrews by [[Cardinal Beaton]] for heresy, did nothing to stem the growth of these ideas. Beaton was assassinated shortly after the execution of George Wishart.&lt;ref&gt;Ian B. Cowan, ''Scottish Reformation: Church and Society in Sixteenth-Century Scotland'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The eventual Reformation of the Scottish Church followed a brief civil war in 1559–60, in which [[Treaty of Berwick (1560)|English intervention]] on the Protestant side was decisive. A Reformed confession of faith rejecting papal jurisdiction was adopted by [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament in 1560]],&lt;ref&gt;Clare Kellar, ''Scotland, England and the Reformation: 1534-61'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; while the young [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was still in France. The most influential figure was theologian [[John Knox]] (1510–1572), who had lived in Switzerland and was a disciple of both Calvin and Wishart. The Protestant [[Church of Scotland]] was formed in the mid-16th century by Knox and the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. [[Roman Catholicism]] was not totally eliminated, and remained strong particularly in parts of the highlands.

The Protestant nobility in Scotland proved critical to the success of the Reformation. The clergymen depended on aristocratic support, so they were seldom equal partners.  However the relationship was strong enough to withstand disputes over the use of ecclesiastical revenues and tensions stemming from the ministers' insistence that all magistrates must be true Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Keith M. Brown, &quot;In Search of the Godly Magistrate in Reformation Scotland,&quot; ''[[Journal of Ecclesiastical History]],'' Oct 1989, Vol. 40#4 pp 553-581&lt;/ref&gt; 

One major impact of the kirk was to moderate the violence that had been endemic in rural Scotland.  The reformed kirk actively mediated local communal conflicts that otherwise would have turned violent. The premises of the parish kirk became a sacred space which often was used for public reconciliation. In order to discourage blood feuds and mortal combat, which had once been common, the kirk used preaching, mandatory attendance at weekly services and at seasonal communion, and public rituals of repentance and punishment. Moving beyond the local level, presbyteries and kirk sessions were increasingly accepted as legitimate alternative to the baronial or civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Graham, &quot;Conflict and Sacred Space in Reformation-Era Scotland,&quot; ''Albion,'' 2001, Vol. 33#3 pp 371-387&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 20th century Protestantism—especially of the Presbyterian variety—was a central value for most Scots, helping shape their identity and way of thinking.

==17th century==
{{Main|Union of the Crowns}}
In 1603, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI King of Scots]] inherited the throne of the [[Kingdom of England]], and became King James I of England, leaving [[Edinburgh]] for London, uniting England and Scotland under one monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chronology of Scottish History|publisher=Geddes &amp; Grosset |isbn=|last=Ross|first=David|year=2002 |quote='''1603:''' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves Edinburgh for London|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union was a [[Personal union|personal]] or [[dynastic union]], with the [[The Crown|Crowns]] remaining both distinct and separate—despite James's best efforts to create a new &quot;imperial&quot; throne of &quot;[[Great Britain]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Smith, ''A History of the Modern British Isles, 1603-1707: The Double Crown'',  (1998), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable conflict between the crown and the [[Covenanters]] over the form of [[Presbyterian church governance|church government]].

===Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Puritan Commonwealth===

====Bishops' Wars====
[[File:Riot against Anglican prayer book 1637.jpg|thumb|right|The [[St Giles Cathedral|St. Giles]] riot initiated by [[Jenny Geddes]] sparked off the Bishops' Wars.]]
Although Scotland and England had both rejected papal authority, the Reformation in each country proceeded in slightly different directions. England retained much of the old Catholic practice, including a formal liturgy and order of service, whereas the Scots embraced more of a free-form Calvinism. Although James had tried to get the Scottish Church to accept some of the High Church Anglicanism of his southern kingdom, he met with limited success. His son and successor, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], took matters further, introducing an English-style Prayer Book into the Scottish church in 1637. This resulted in anger and widespread rioting. (The story goes that it was initiated by a certain [[Jenny Geddes]] who threw a stool in [[St Giles Cathedral]]). Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the [[National Covenant]] in 1638, objecting to the King's liturgical innovations. In November of the same year matters were taken even further, when at a meeting of the General Assembly in Glasgow the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis. Charles gathered a military force; but as neither side wished to push the matter to a full military conflict, a temporary settlement was concluded at [[Berwick|Pacification of Berwick]]. Matters remained unresolved until 1640 when, in a renewal of hostilities, Charles's northern forces were defeated by the Scots at the [[Battle of Newburn]] to the west of Newcastle. During the course of these &quot;[[Bishops' Wars]]&quot; Charles tried to raise an army of Irish Catholics, but was forced to back down after a storm of protest in Scotland and England. The backlash from this venture provoked a [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion in Ireland]] and Charles was forced to appeal to the English Parliament for funds. Parliament's demands for reform in England  eventually resulted in the [[English Civil War]]. This series of civil wars that engulfed England in the 1640s and 50s is known to modern historians as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Covenanters]] meanwhile, were left governing Scotland, where they raised a large army of their own and tried to impose their religious settlement on [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]] and [[Roman Catholics]] in the north of the country.

====Civil war====
[[File:1st Marquess of Montrose.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]], who led a successful pro-royalist campaign in the Highlands in 1644-46.]] 
As the civil wars developed, the English [[roundhead|Parliamentarians]] appealed to the Scots Covenanters for military aid against the King. A [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was entered into, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England. Scottish troops played a major part in the defeat of Charles I, notably at the [[battle of Marston Moor]]. An army under the Earl of Leven occupied the North of England for some time.

However, not all Scots supported the Covenanter's taking arms against their King. In 1644, [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] under [[Alasdair Mac Colla|Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)]], and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] began in September 1644 with his victory at [[battle of Tippermuir]]. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]]. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.

The following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians. In this secret '[[Engagers|Engagement]]', the Scots promised military aid in return for the King's agreement to implement Presbyterianism in England on a three-year trial basis. The [[Duke of Hamilton]] led an invasion of England to free the King, but he was defeated by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in August 1648 at the Battle of Preston.

====Cromwellian occupation and restoration====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[William M'Culloch]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Cromwell at Dunbar&quot;, Andrew Carrick Gow. The battle of Dunbar was a crushing defeat for the Scottish Covenanters]]

The Covenanter government was outraged by Parliament's  execution of Charles I in 1649, carried out in the face of their strongest objections. No sooner did news of his death reach the north than his son was proclaimed King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in Edinburgh. [[Oliver Cromwell]] invaded Scotland in 1650, and defeated the Scottish army in battles at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] and [[battle of Worcester|Worcester]]. Scotland was then occupied by an English force under [[George Monck]] throughout the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and incorporated into the Puritan-governed [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. 

From 1652 to 1660, Scotland was part of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, under English control but gaining equal trading rights. Upon its collapse, and with the restoration of Charles II, [[Scottish independence]] returned. Scotland regained its parliament, but the English [[Navigation Acts]] prevented the Scots engaging in what would have been lucrative trading with England's growing colonies. The formal frontier between the two countries was re-established, with customs duties which, while they protected Scottish cloth industries from cheap English imports, also denied access to English markets for Scottish cattle or Scottish linens.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel 1984 p 370&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Restoration, Charles' Scottish affairs were managed by senior noblemen, the most prominent of whom was John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale, his Secretary of State and High Commissioner to the Scottish Parliament. Near the outset of the reign Episcopacy was reintroduced. This was to be a source of particular trouble in the south-west of the country, an area particularly strong in its Presbyterian sympathies. Abandoning the official church, many of the people here began to attend illegal field assemblies, known as conventicles. Official attempts to suppress these led to a rising in 1679, defeated by James Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, at the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]]. In the early 1680s a more intense phase of persecution began, in what was later to be called &quot;[[the Killing Time]]&quot;. When Charles died in 1685 and his brother, a Roman Catholic, succeeded him as [[James II of England|James VII of Scotland (and II of England)]], matters came to a head.

===The Deposition of James VII===
{{Main|Glorious Revolution}}
[[File:James II 1633-1701.jpg|thumb|left|[[James II of England|James VII of Scotland (and II of England)]], who was deposed in 1688.]] 
James's attempt to introduce [[religious toleration]] to England's Roman Catholics alienated his Protestant subjects. Neither this, nor his moves towards absolutism, provoked outright rebellion, as it was believed that he would be succeeded by his daughter [[Mary II of Scotland|Mary]], a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. When, in 1688, James produced a male heir, everything changed. At the invitation of seven Englishmen, William landed in England with 40,000 men, and James fled. Whilst this was primarily an English event, the so-called &quot;[[Glorious Revolution]]&quot; had a great impact on Scottish history. Whilst William and Mary accepted limits on royal power, under the [[Bill of Rights 1689|''Bill of Rights'']] (a contract between themselves and the English parliament), Scotland had an equivalent document in the ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]s''. This is an important document in the evolution of the rule of law and the rights of subjects.

Most significant Scots supported William II and Mary II, but many (particularly in the Highlands) remained sympathetic to James VII. His cause, which became known as [[Jacobitism]], spawned a series of uprisings. An initial Jacobite rising under [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee]] (''[[Bonnie Dundee]]'') defeated William's forces at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] in 1689, but Dundee was slain in the fighting, and the army was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]]. The complete defeat of James in Ireland by William at the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (1691), ended matters for a time. (Ironically, the Protestant William had also enjoyed the support of the [[Pope]] and the Catholic [[Habsburg]] monarchy against the aggressive foreign policy of [[Louis XIV of France]]).

===Economic crisis of the 1690s===
Economic conditions were favourable in the peaceful Restoration period from 1660 to 1688, as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle-raising, and Glasgow became an increasingly important commercial centre, opening up trade with the American colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;&gt;T. C. Smout, &quot;The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. I: The Economic Background:&quot; ''Economic History Review,'' April 1964 v 16 pp 455-67 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2592848 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Smout, 1963&quot;&gt;T. C. Smout, ''Scottish Trade on the Eve of the Union, 1660-1707'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; The closing decade of the 17th century brought economic disaster as bad harvests of the ''seven ill years'' in the 1690s led to severe famine and depopulation. The cost of grain doubled because of scarcity; suffering  was worst in the north and least in the eastern lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Karen J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland lost about 15% of its population from deaths, outmigration, and lowered birth rates. English protectionism kept Scots traders out of the English colonies, and English foreign policy disrupted trade with France. Many Scots emigrated to [[Ulster]] (the [[Ulster-Scots people|Ulster-Scots]]). The psychological blow to national self-confidence was severe.  The Parliament of Scotland of 1695 enacted proposals that might help the desperate economic situation, including setting up the [[Bank of Scotland]]. The ''Act for the Settling of Schools'' established a parish-based system of public education throughout Scotland. The [[Company of Scotland]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription to trade with Africa and the Indies. Glasgow lost 300.765 people in 1690 - 1695.

===Failure of Darien scheme===
[[File:New Caledonia in Darien.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The colony of New Caledonia on the Isthmus of Darien]]
{{main|Darien scheme}}

With the dream of building a lucrative overseas colony for Scotland, the Company of Scotland invested in the [[Darien scheme]], an ambitious plan devised by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] to establish a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the hope of establishing trade with the Far East. The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the  landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotland's economy. Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower classes volunteered as colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. Hidalgo, &quot;To Get Rich for Our Homeland: The Company of Scotland and the Colonization of the Darién&quot;, ''Colonial Latin American Historical Review,'' 10:3 (Summer/Verano 2001): 156&lt;/ref&gt;  But the English government opposed the idea: involved in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] from 1689 to 1697 against [[France]], it did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]]. The English investors had perforce to withdraw. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised 400,000 pounds in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; under attack by the Spanish from nearby [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]; and refused aid by the English in the [[West Indies]], the colonists abandoned their project in 1700. Only 1000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland.

== 18th century ==
Scotland was a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million in 1755. Its transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly in the next 150 years, following its union with Britain in 1707 and its integration with the advanced English and imperial economies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Hamilton 1963&quot;&gt;Henry Hamilton, ''An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation was led by two cities that grew rapidly after 1770. [[History of Glasgow|Glasgow]], on the river Clyde, was the base for the tobacco and sugar trade with an emerging textile industry. [[History of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] was the administrative and intellectual centre where the Scottish Enlightenment was chiefly based.&lt;ref&gt;James Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius: the Scottish Enlightenment; Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union with England===
{{Main|Acts of Union 1707}}

By the start of the 18th century, a [[political union]] between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing British Empire. With economic stagnation since the late 17th century, which was particularly acute in 1704; the country depended more and more heavily on sales of cattle and linen to England, who used this to create pressure for a union.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Smout, 1963&quot;/&gt; The Scottish parliament voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69, to adopt the [[Treaty of Union]]. It was also a full economic union; indeed, most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as &quot;Great Britain&quot;. It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. Scottish law remained separate from English law, and the religious system was not changed. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Smout, &quot;The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. I: The Economic Background&quot; pp. 455-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, &quot;The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences&quot; ,''Economic History Review'', April 1964 vol. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacobitism===
{{Main|Jacobitism}}
[[File:Bonnie prince charlie.JPG|thumb|right|&quot;The Young Pretender&quot; [[Charles Edward Stuart|''Bonnie Prince Charlie'']] began his campaign on Scotland's west coast. His hopes to gain the Scottish and English thrones died at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746]]
By 1700, the Protestant monarchy seemed in danger of coming to an end with the childless Stuart [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]]. Rather than return to her Roman Catholic brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the English Parliament decided that [[Sophia of Hanover]] and her descendants should succeed ([[Act of Settlement 1701]]). However, the Scottish counterpart, the [[Act of Security]], prohibited a Roman Catholic successor, leaving open the possibility that the crowns would diverge.

Rather than risk the possible return of James Francis Edward Stuart, then living in France, the English parliament pressed for full union of the two countries. In 1707, despite much opposition in Scotland, the Treaty of Union was concluded.

The treaty, which became the [[Act of Union 1707]], confirmed the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] succession. It abolished both the Parliaments of England and Scotland, and established the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].  The act also created a common citizenship, giving Scots free access to English markets. The [[Church of Scotland]] and Scottish law and courts remained separate. This union was highly controversial among Scots, and increasingly so as the hoped-for economic revival was not immediately forthcoming. When it did come, in the second half of the century, it was Lowland Scotland that received the benefits.

[[Jacobitism]] was revived by the unpopularity of the union. In 1708 [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], who became known as &quot;The Old Pretender,&quot; attempted an invasion with a French fleet, but the Royal Navy prevented any from landing.  A more serious attempt occurred in 1715. This rising (known as ''The 'Fifteen'') envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, [[Devon]], and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine, [[Earl of Mar]], nicknamed ''Bobbin' John'', raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], but let a smaller government force under the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] hold the [[Stirling]] plain. Part of Mar's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)|Battle of Preston]], surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless. He fled back to France. An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended at the [[Battle of Glen Shiel]].

In 1745 the Jacobite rising known as ''The 'Forty-Five'' began. [[Charles Edward Stuart]], known to history as ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'' or the ''Young Pretender'', son of the ''Old Pretender'', landed on the island of [[Eriskay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]].&lt;ref&gt;Moray McLaren, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'' (1972) pp. 39-108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several clans unenthusiastically joined him.  At the outset he was successful, taking [[Edinburgh]] and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].  They marched into England and got as far as [[Derby]].  It became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a crisis of confidence and retreated to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Barnes, ''The Jacobite Rebellion 1745-46'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] crushed the ''&quot;Forty-Five&quot;'' and the hopes of the Jacobites at the [[Battle of Culloden]] on 16 April 1746. Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746,  when he escaped back to France with the help of [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]]. He died a broken man in 1788, and his cause died with him.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Preston, ''The road to Culloden Moor: Bonnie Prince Charlie and the '45 Rebellion'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Jacobite politics===
[[File:3rdDukeOfArgyll.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll]], and dominant political figure in Scotland, 1720s-61.]]
With the advent of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union]] and the demise of [[Jacobitism]], access to London and the Empire opened up very attractive career opportunities for ambitious middle-class and upper-class Scots, who seized the chance to become entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Divine, ''The Scottish Nation'', (Viking, 1999), pp. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent [[British Empire]]. Historian Neil Davidson notes that “after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland”. Davidson also states that “far from being ‘peripheral’ to the British economy, Scotland – or more precisely, the Lowlands – lay at its core”.&lt;ref name=Davidson2000pp94-5&gt;N. Davidson, ''The Origins of Scottish Nationhood'' (Pluto Press, 2000), pp. 94–5.&lt;/ref&gt; British officials especially appreciated Scottish soldiers. As the Secretary of War told Parliament in 1751, &quot;I am for having always in our army as many Scottish soldiers as possible...because they are generally more hardy and less mutinous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Colley, ''Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837'' (Yale UP, 1992) p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The national policy of aggressively recruiting Scots for senior civilian positions stirred up resentment among Englishmen. ranging from violent diatribes by [[John Wilkes]], to vulgar jokes and obscene cartoons in the popular press,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Colley, ''Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837'' (1992), pp. 105-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the haughty ridicule by intellectuals such as [[Samuel Johnson]] that was much resented by Scots. In his great ''Dictionary'' Johnson defined oats as, &quot;a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.&quot; To which Lord Elibank retorted, &quot;Very true, and where will you find such men and such horses?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Prideaux Courtney and David Nichol Smith, ''A Bibliography of Samuel Johnson'' (1915), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish politics in the late 18th century was dominated by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s, with the benign management of [[Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll]] (1682–1761), who was in effect the &quot;viceroy of Scotland&quot; from the 1720s until his death in 1761. Scotland generally supported the king with enthusiasm during the [[American Revolution]]. [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] (1742–1811) dominated political affairs in the latter part of the century. Dundas put a brake on intellectual and social change through his ruthless manipulation of patronage in alliance with Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], until he lost power in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Lenman, ''Enlightenment and Change: Scotland 1746-1832'' (2nd ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The main unit of local government was the parish, and since it was also part of the church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords (&quot;lairds&quot;) and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parish's control. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in most places by the 1850s.&lt;ref name=Devine2001pp84-89&gt;T. M. Devine, ''The Scottish Nation, 1700-2000'' (2001), pp. 84-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of the clan system===
[[File:Highland garb display.JPG|thumb|Romanticised depiction of [[Scottish Clan|Highland clansmen]] in a display of modern [[tartan]] merchandise]]
{{See also|Scottish clan}}
The support given by the Highland clans to the Jacobite rebellion led London to act decisively after harshly suppressing the rebellion in 1746: the new policy was to systematically destroy the old [[Scottish clan|clan system]] and to encourage or force the chiefs into becoming modern landlords. Those chiefs who went along gave up their traditional roles in leading soldiers and running local courts. They cleared many of their people from the land, and set up highly profitable agricultural practices.  

After the battle of Culloden the leaders were declared to be traitors, with Jacobite officers executed and many of the rebel soldiers shipped to the colonies as indentured servants.  Key laws included the [[Dress Act 1746]], the [[Act of Proscription 1746]], and especially the [[Heritable Jurisdictions Act]] of 1746. All aspects of Highland culture, especially the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language were forbidden. Parliament also banned the bearing of arms and the wearing of tartans, and limited the activities of the Episcopalian Church. After a generation the Highlands had been transformed and the laws were no longer needed; they were mostly repealed.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Roberts, [http://books.google.com/books?id=WlnNUCS4R_MC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=clans+tartan+laws+jacobite&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=nJoTTry1IMGq8QODnbX8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745''] (2002), pp. 193-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historians debate whether the dramatic changes merely reflect long-term trends that were more-or-less inevitable, or whether government intervention played the decisive role in changing the goals and roles of the chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Gourievidis, &quot;Representing the Disputed Past of Northern Scotland: The Highland Clearances in Museums,&quot; ''History &amp; Memory'' vol 12#2 Fall/Winter 2000, pp. 122-141&lt;/ref&gt; As Conway (2006) concludes, the new policies &quot;went far beyond earlier efforts to promote economic development in the Highlands and ...represented the first real endeavour to transform the region's social system....the post-rebellion legislation certainly seems to have accelerated the change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Conway, ''War, State, and Society in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland by Stephen Conway '' (2006) p 139&lt;/ref&gt;  However on the other side, Devine (1999) and Ray (2001) argue that long-term economic and social changes were already undermining the clan system.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, ''The Scottish Nation'' pp 179-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Ray, [http://books.google.com/books?id=2pyqgupHqtgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=clans+tartan+laws+jacobite&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=i54TTpD2E8eu8gPgzOH8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEYQ6wEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Highland Heritage: Scottish Americans in the American South''] (2001), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Crofts at Borreraig - geograph.org.uk - 137969.jpg|thumb|right|[[Croft (land)|Crofts]] at [[Borreraig]] on the island of [[Skye]].]]
The major result of these changes were the [[Highland Clearances]], by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered [[forced displacement]] as lands were [[enclosure|enclosed]], principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under [[Scots law]], the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions.&lt;ref&gt;E. Richards, ''The Highland Clearances: People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, ''Scotland: a History'' (2005), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who remained were now [[croft (land)|crofters]]:  poor families living on &quot;crofts&quot;—very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with [[kelp]]ing industry (where men burned kelp for the ashes), fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700-1850'' (1995), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The era of the Napoleonic wars, 1790–1815, brought prosperity, optimism, and economic growth to the Highlands. The economy grew thanks to higher wages, as well as large scale infrastructure spending such as the [[Caledonian Canal]] project. On the East Coast, farmlands were improved, and high prices for cattle brought money to the community. Service in the Army was also attractive to young men from Highlands, who sent pay home and retired there with their army pensions, but the prosperity ended after 1815, and long-run negative factors began to undermine the economic position of the crofters.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gray, ''The Highland Economy, 1750–1850'' (Edinburgh, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (Crown Publishing Group, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; together with Scotland's traditional connections to France, then in the throes of [[the Enlightenment]], led Scots intellectuals to develop a uniquely practical branch of [[humanism]] to the extent that [[Voltaire]] said &quot;we look to Scotland for all our ideas of [[civilization]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarrosoVoltaire&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = [[José Manuel Barroso]] | title = The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy  | journal = EUROPA: Enlightenment Lecture Series, [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] | date = 28 November 2006  | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/06/756&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5yk5UYLMc| archivedate =17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who held the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1729 to 1746.

Much of what is incorporated in the [[scientific method]] (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Denby&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= |title=The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy |journal=The New Yorker | date = 11 October 2004 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5z3E5hVjt| archivedate =17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume became a major figure in the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophical]] and [[empiricist]] traditions of philosophy.

It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and in the 21st century still framed discussions on [[globalisation]] and tariffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fry&quot;&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist, [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]], [[Joseph Black]], physicist and chemist, and [[James Hutton]], the first modern geologist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Repcheck&quot;&gt;J.

With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable. However, Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hamilton, ''An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Some progress was visible: agriculture in the Lowlands was steadily upgraded after 1700 and standards remained high.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Martin Devine, ''The transformation of rural Scotland: social change and the agrarian economy, 1660-1815'' (Edinburgh UP, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; there were the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow [[Tobacco Lords]] after 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities| publisher =Virginia Historical Society | jstor =4248011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Durie, &quot;Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen&quot;, ''Journal of Design History'', 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the established Scottish banks such as the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695-1995'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England, where banks were also more heavily regulated. Historians have emphasised that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J.

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] mentioned Scottish Presbyterianism in [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] (1905), and many scholars in recent decades argued that Calvinism's &quot;this worldly asceticism&quot; was integral to Scotland's rapid economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Callum G.

===Religious fragmentation===
{{Main|History of Christianity in Scotland}}
[[File:EbenezerErskine.jpg|thumb|140px|left|upright|[[Ebenezer Erskine]] whose actions led to the establishment of the [[First Secession|Secession Church]].]]
The late 18th century saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the [[Church of Scotland]] that had been created in the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. These fractures were  prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the [[Evangelicals]] and the [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|Moderate Party]] over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the [[First Secession]] and headed by figures including [[Ebenezer Erskine]], led to the creation of a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 lead to the foundation of the independent [[Relief Church]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1-5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), pp. 416-7.&lt;/ref&gt; These churches gained strength in the [[Evangelical Revival]] of the later 18th century.&lt;ref name=Ditchfield1998p91&gt;G. M. Ditchfield, ''The Evangelical Revival'' (1998), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Long after the triumph of the [[Church of Scotland]] in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to an old-fashioned Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. The remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the [[Scottish SPCK|SSPCK]] missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society.&lt;ref name=Robb1990&gt;G. Robb, &quot;Popular Religion and the Christianization of the Scottish Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&quot;, ''Journal of Religious History'', 1990, 16(1): 18-34&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands.  Conditions also grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly-run mission.  Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite rebellions in the early 18th century, they also suffered a decline in fortunes.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt;{{clear}}

Although Scotland increasingly adopted the English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=J. Buchan| title=Crowded with Genius| publisher=Harper Collins| year =2003 |isbn=|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Macpherson]] was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'' written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and  its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] in European, and especially in [[German language|German]], literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=J. Buchan| title=Crowded with Genius| publisher=Harper Collins| year =2003 |isbn= |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=D. Thomson|title =The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's &quot;Ossian&quot;| publisher =Oliver &amp; Boyd| year =1952| location =Aberdeen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the major literary figures of the following century, [[Robert Burns]] and Walter Scott, would be highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected [[Folk music|folk songs]] from across Scotland, often revising or [[Literary adaptation|adapting]] them. His poem (and song) &quot;[[Auld Lang Syne]]&quot; is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and &quot;[[Scots Wha Hae]]&quot; served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=L.

===Education===
{{Main|History of education in Scotland}}
[[File:Old College quadrangle, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|[[Old College, University of Edinburgh]], rebuilt in 1789 according to plans drawn up by [[Robert Adam]].]] 
A legacy of the Reformation in Scotland was the aim of having a school in every parish, which was underlined by an act of the Scottish parliament in 1696 (reinforced in 1801). In rural communities this obliged local landowners (heritors) to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster, while ministers and local [[Presbyterian polity|presbyteries]] oversaw the quality of the education. The headmaster or &quot;dominie&quot; was often university educated and enjoyed high local prestige.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Hendrie, ''The dominie: a profile of the Scottish headmaster'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The kirk schools were active in the rural lowlands but played a minor role in the Highlands, the islands, and in the fast-growing industrial towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, ''Scottish Nation'' (1999), p. 99; R. D. Anderson, ''Education and the Scottish People, 1750-1918'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The schools taught in English, not in Gaelic, because that language was seen as a leftover of Catholicism and was not an expression of Scottish nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Anderson, ''Education and the Scottish people'' (1995), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; In cities such as Glasgow the Catholics operated their own schools, which directed their youth into clerical and middle class occupations, as well as religious vocations.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. O'Hagan, ''The Contribution of the Religious Orders to Education in Glasgow During the Period, 1847-1918'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;democratic myth&quot; emerged in the 19th century to the effect that many a &quot;lad of pairts&quot; had been able to rise up through the system to take high office and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003&gt;R. Anderson, &quot;The history of Scottish Education pre-1980&quot;, in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (2nd ed., 2003), pp. 219-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical research has largely undermined the myth. Kirk schools were not free, attendance was not compulsory and they generally imparted only basic literacy such as the ability to read the Bible. Poor children, starting at age 7, were done by age 8 or 9; the majority were finished by age 11 or 12. The result was widespread basic reading ability; since there was an extra fee for writing, half the people never learned to write. Scots were not significantly better educated than the English and other contemporary nations. A few talented poor boys did go to university, but usually they were helped by aristocratic or gentry sponsors. Most of them became poorly paid teachers or ministers, and none became important figures in the Scottish Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=Devine2001p91-100&gt;Devine, ''Scottish Nation'' (1999), pp. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century there were five universities in Scotland, at [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[St. Andrews University|St. Andrews]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's]] and [[Marischal College|Marischial]] Colleges in Aberdeen, compared with only two in England. Originally oriented to clerical and legal training, after the religious and political upheavals of the 17th century they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. It helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt;{{clear}}

==19th century==
Scotland's transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Hamilton 1963&quot;/&gt; The population grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Cairncross, ''The Scottish economy'' (1953) p 10&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, long based on agriculture,&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Hamilton 1963&quot;/&gt; began to industrialize after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. In 1861 the American Civil War suddenly cut off the supplies of raw cotton and the industry never recovered.  Thanks to its many entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, Scotland became a world centre for engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Olive Checkland and Sydney Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832 - 1914'' (2nd ed. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party politics===
[[File:Hardie elect.jpg|thumb|An election advertisement for Scottish Labour leader Keir Hardie.]] 
The [[Scottish Reform Act 1832]]  increased the number of Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From this point until the end of the century, the Whigs and (after 1859) their successors the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives.&lt;ref name=Devine&amp;Finlay1996pp64-5&gt;T. M. Devine and R. J. Finlay, ''Scotland in the Twentieth Century'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), pp. 64-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English-educated Scottish peer [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] (1784–1860) led a coalition government from 1852-5, but in general very few Scots held office in the government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Oaten, ''Coalition: the Politics and Personalities of Coalition Government from 1850'' (Harriman House, 2007), pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure by reviving the post of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], which had been in abeyance since 1746.&lt;ref&gt;F. Requejo and K-J Nagel, ''Federalism Beyond Federations: Asymmetry and Processes of Re-symmetrization in Europe'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed the [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], a wealthy landowner who was both Chancellor of Aberdeen University and Lord Lieutenant of Banff.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Kellas, &quot;Unionists as nationalists&quot;, in W. Lockley, ed., ''Anglo-Scottish Relations from 1900 to Devolution and Beyond'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included the Tory, [[Peelite]] and Liberal [[William E. Gladstone]], who held the office four times between 1868 and 1894.&lt;ref name=Quinault2007&gt;R. Quinault, &quot;Scots on Top?

Issn: 0018-2753 Fulltext: [[Ebsco]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first Scottish Liberal to become prime minister was [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]], from 1894–95, like Aberdeen before him a product of the English education system.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kumar, ''The Making of English National Identity'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In the later 19th century the issue of [[Irish Home Rule]] led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority breaking away to form the [[Liberal Unionists]] in 1886.&lt;ref name=Devine&amp;Finlay1996pp64-5/&gt; The growing importance of the working classes was marked by [[Keir Hardie]]'s success in the [[Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888]], leading to the foundation of the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888)|Scottish Labour Party]], which was absorbed into the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.&lt;ref&gt;D. Howell, ''British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1984), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Industrial expansion===
[[File:NewlanarkNL06.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Lanark]] cotton mill on the banks of the River Clyde, founded in 1786.]]
From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the [[American Civil War]] cut off the supplies of raw cotton.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Henderson, ''The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861-65'' (1934), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (1997), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining continued to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;A. Campbell, ''The Scottish Miners, 1874-1939'' (2000),&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher A. Whatley, &quot;Scottish 'collier serfs', British coal workers? Aspects of Scottish collier society in the eighteenth century,&quot; ''Labour History Review,'' Fall 1995, Vol. 60 Issue 2, pp 66-79&lt;/ref&gt; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled the miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, equalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Campbell, ''Scottish Miners, 1874-1939. Vol. 1: Industry, Work &amp; Community;'' ''The Scottish Miners, 1874-1939. Vol. 2: Trade Unions and Politics.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between [[Monklands (district)|Monkland]] and [[Kirkintilloch]], opened in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Marshall, ''A History of Railway Locomotives Until 1831'' (1926) p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the [[Aberdeen Angus]] to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832-1914'' (2nd edn., 1989), pp. 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1900 Scotland had 3500 miles of railway; their main economic contribution was moving supplies in and product out for heavy industry, especially coal-mining.&lt;ref&gt;W. Vamplew, &quot;Railways and the Transformation of the Scottish Economy&quot;, ''Economic History Review'', Feb 1971, vol. 24 (1), pp. 37-54 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2593639 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shipping on the Clyde.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Shipping on the Clyde&quot;, by [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], 1881.]]
Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;William Ferguson, ''The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest'' (1998) [http://www.questia.com/read/54868029 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial belt ran across the country from southwest to northeast; by 1900 the four industrialised counties of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire, and Ayrshire contained 44 per cent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;I.H. Adams, ''The Making of Urban Scotland'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as &quot;the Second City of the Empire&quot; after London.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. MacKenzie, &quot;The second city of the Empire: Glasgow - imperial municipality&quot;, in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, ''Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity'' (2003), pp. 215-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Shipbuilding on [[Clydeside]] (the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scott family's]] shipyard at Greenock. After 1860 the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. ''Clydebuilt'' became an industry benchmark of quality, and the river's shipyards were given contracts for warships.&lt;ref name=Shields1949&gt;J. Shields, ''Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde'' (1949).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Lee, ''Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century'' (1995), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to indoors government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.&lt;ref&gt;J. Melling, &quot;Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britain's heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870-1920&quot;, ''International Review of Social History'', Dec 1981, vol. 26 (3), pp. 255-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual life===
[[File:Sir Walter Scott - Raeburn.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Walter Scott]] whose [[Waverley Novels]] helped define Scottish identity in the 19th century.]]
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnusson&quot;/&gt; disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the mathematicians and physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and the engineers and inventors [[James Watt]] and [[William Murdoch]], whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wills, ''Scottish Firsts: a Celebration of Innovation and Achievement'' (Edinbugh: Mainstream, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In literature the most successful figure of the mid-nineteenth century was [[Walter Scott]], who began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, [[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]] in 1814, is often called the first [[historical novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=K. S. Whetter |contribution= |year=2008 |title=Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance |journal= |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |page=28|place= |publisher=Ashgate |url= |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=N. Davidson |contribution= |year=2000 |title=The Origins of Scottish Nationhood |journal= |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |page=136 |place= |publisher=Pluto Press |url= |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl=|archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s work included the [[urban Gothic]] novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), and played a major part in developing the historical adventure in books like ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' and ''[[Treasure Island]]''. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' stories helped found the tradition of detective fiction. The &quot;[[Kailyard school|kailyard tradition]]&quot; at the end of the century, brought elements of [[fantasy]] and [[folklore]] back into fashion as can be seen in the work of figures like [[J. M. Barrie]], most famous for his creation of [[Peter Pan]], and [[George MacDonald]], whose works, including ''[[Phantasies]]'', played a major part in the creation of the [[fantasy]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=Cultural Profile: 19th and early 20th century developments |journal=Visiting Arts: Scotland: Cultural Profile |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/scotland/Directories/Scotland_Cultural_Profile/-5402.html |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62yP6lcz7  |archivedate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The [[Glasgow School]], which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the [[Celtic Revival]] the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental [[Europe]] and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of [[Glasgow School|The Four]]: acclaimed [[architect]] [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], his wife the [[Painting|painter]] and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]], and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Courier Dover, 2002), pp. 283-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and romanticism of the Highlands===
{{Main|Highlands of Scotland}}
[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s flattering portrait of the [[kilt]]ed [[King George IV]].]]
This period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, but by the 19th century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people. In the 1820s, as part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic revival]], tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Roberts, [http://books.google.com/books?id=WlnNUCS4R_MC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=clans+tartan+laws+jacobite&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=nJoTTry1IMGq8QODnbX8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745''] (Edinburgh University Press, 2002), pp. 193-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sievers2007&gt;M.

Morère, ''Scotland and France in the Enlightenment'' (Bucknell University Press, 2004), pp. 75-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Ferguson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nPpp6ED8c3EC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=ossian+macpherson&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=UaIUTrLIAYGq8APf5tz7Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEkQ6wEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ossian%20macpherson&amp;f=false ''The identity of the Scottish Nation: an Historic Quest''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. The world paid attention to their literary redefinition of Scottishness, as they forged an image largely based on characteristics in polar opposition to those associated with England and modernity. This new identity made it possible for Scottish culture to become integrated into a wider European and North American context, not to mention tourist sites, but it also locked in a sense of &quot;otherness&quot; which Scotland began to shed only in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Divine, ''Scottish Nation'' pp. 292-95; for the antecedents created by the Stuarts see Murray Pittock, ''The Invention of Scotland: The Stuart Myth and the Scottish Identity, 1638 to the Present'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's  &quot;staging&quot; of the royal [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]] in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan, resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and became a major symbol of Scottish identity.&lt;ref&gt;N. C. Milne, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Z_G1jHe2aAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=walter+scot+royal+visit+tartan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XkAUTq-eOs7KsgbFmrzMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Scottish Culture and Traditions''] (Paragon Publishing, 2010), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by [[Queen Victoria]], who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort, with [[Balmoral Castle]] in Aberdeenshire becoming a major royal residence from 1852.&lt;ref name=Sievers2007/&gt;

Despite these changes the highlands remained very poor and traditional, with few connections to the uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gray, ''The Highland Economy, 1750-1850'' (Greenwood, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of [[Duke of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Duke of Atholl|Atholl]], [[Duke of Buccleuch|Buccleuch]], and [[Duke of Sutherland|Sutherland]], owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Pelling, ''Social Geography of British Elections 1885-1910'' (1960, Gregg Revivals, rpt., 1994), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly after the end of the boom created by the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.&lt;ref&gt;B. Thomas, ''The Industrial Revolution and the Atlantic Economy: Selected Essays'' (Routledge, 1993), pp. 93-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato famine]] of the 1840s was caused by a plant disease that reached the Highlands in 1846, where 150,000 people faced disaster because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk).  They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Smout, ''A Century of the Scottish People: 1830-1950'' (1986), pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rural life====
The unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional subject and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The politically powerless poor crofters embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian [[Christian revival|revival]] after 1800,&lt;ref&gt;Divine, ''The Scottish Nation''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the breakaway &quot;Free Church&quot; after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. This energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords, preparing them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the [[Highland Land League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=J.

===Migration===
[[File:Andrew Carnegie's statue, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|The Statue of emigrant, industrialist and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] in his home town of [[Dunfermline]].]]
The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Cairncross, ''The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University'' (Glasgow: Glasgow University Press, 1953), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the development of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841-1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.&lt;ref name=Huston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii/&gt; Scotland lost a much higher proportion of its population than England and Wales,&lt;ref name=Thompson1990pp9-10&gt;F.

Williams, ''A Companion to Nineteenth-Century Britain'' (John Wiley and Sons, 2004), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt; This not only limited Scotland's population increase, but meant that almost every family lost members due to emigration and, because more of the migrants were young males, it skewed the sex and age ratios of the country.&lt;ref name=Thompson1990pp9-10/&gt;

===Religious schism and revival===
{{Main|History of Christianity in Scotland}}
[[File:Thomas Chalmers statue, George Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|180px|Thomas Chalmers statue, Edinburgh]]
After prolonged years of struggle, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted &quot;intrusive&quot; presentations to livings by patrons. The following &quot;Ten Years' Conflict&quot; of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]] known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.&lt;ref name=Robb1990/&gt; Chalmers's ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealized small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognized the individuality of their members and the need for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Brown Stewart, ''Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mechie, ''The Church and Scottish social development, 1780–1870'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterian Church]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt; There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the [[United Secession Church]] in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]], which in turn  joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterians]] and a remnant that had not merged in 1900 as the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt;

[[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt; Episcopalianism also revived in the 19th century as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the [[Episcopal Church in Scotland]] in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt; [[Baptist Union of Scotland|Baptist]], [[Congregational Union of Scotland|Congregationalist]] and [[Methodist]] churches had appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century,&lt;ref name=Koch2006p416-7/&gt; partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the [[Salvation Army]], which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.&lt;ref name=Ditchfield1998p91/&gt;

===Development of state education===
{{Main|History of education in Scotland}}
[[File:Mearns Street Public School 28Feb10.jpg|thumb|left|The Mearns Street Public School built for the [[Greenock]] Burgh School Board.]]
Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants, then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship, and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.&lt;ref name=Devine2001p91-100&gt;T. M. Devine, ''The Scottish Nation, 1700-2000'' (Penguin Books, 2001), pp. 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = |title = Education records |journal = National Archive of Scotland |year = 2006 |url = http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/education.asp |archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5zt5P28yI | archivedate =3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education was now compulsory from five to thirteen and many new board schools were built. Larger urban school boards established &quot;higher grade&quot; (secondary) schools as a cheaper alternative to the burgh schools. The Scottish Education Department introduced a Leaving Certificate Examination in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education and in 1890 school fees were abolished, creating a state-funded national system of free basic education and common examinations.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; 

At the beginning of the 19th century Scottish universities had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. After two commissions of enquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889, the curriculum and system of graduation were reformed to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. Entrance examinations equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003p224&gt;R. Anderson, &quot;The history of Scottish Education pre-1980&quot;, in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The historic [[University of Glasgow]] became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. It prepared students for non-commercial careers in government, the law, medicine, education, and the ministry and a smaller group for careers in science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Robertson, &quot;The Development of an Urban University: Glasgow, 1860-1914&quot;, ''History of Education Quarterly'', Winter 1990, vol. 30 (1), pp. 47-78.&lt;/ref&gt; St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Licentiate in Arts (LLA), which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Rayner-Canham2008&gt;M.

==Early 20th century==

===Fishing===
The years before the First World War were the golden age of the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches dominated Europe's herring trade, accounting for a third of the British catch. High productivity came about thanks to the transition to more productive steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europe's fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails.&lt;ref&gt;C. Reid, &quot;Intermediation, Opportunism and the State Loans Debate in Scotland's Herring Fisheries before World War I,&quot; ''International Journal of Maritime History,'' June 2004, vol. 16 (1), pp. 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Khaki Election]] of 1900, nationalist concern with the [[Boer War]] meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in the next election.&lt;ref name=Hearn2000p45/&gt; The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912,&lt;ref name=Devine&amp;Finlay1996pp64-5/&gt; usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;L.

Mitchell, ''How Scotland Votes'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Scots played a major part in the leadership of UK political parties producing a Conservative Prime Minister in [[Arthur Balfour]] (1902–05) and a Liberal one in [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (1905–08).&lt;ref name=Quinault2007/&gt; Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman.&lt;ref name=Hearn2000p45&gt;J.

Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. M. Macdonald and E. W. McFarland, eds, ''Scotland and the Great War'' (Edinburgh: Tuckwell Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money, engaging with the conflict with some enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;D.

A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (Penguin, 2001),  p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991&gt;B.

Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the [[Battle of Loos]], where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991/&gt; Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p49/&gt; Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of [[Lewis and Harris]] suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991/&gt; Clydeside shipyards and the engineering shops of west-central Scotland became the most significant centre of shipbuilding and arms production in the Empire. In the Lowlands, particularly Glasgow, poor working and living conditions led to industrial and political unrest.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p49&gt;J. Buchanan, ''Scotland'' (Langenscheidt, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war in June 1919 the German fleet interned in Scapa Flow was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled]] by its crews, to avoid its ships being taken over by the victorious allies.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Potter, ''Sea Power: a Naval History'' (Naval Institute Press, 2nd edn., 1981), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic boom and stagnation===
[[File:Beardmore advertisement Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A 1923 advert for [[William Beardmore and Company]], Clydeside, who employed 40,000 workers at its height.]]

A boom was created by the First World War, with the shipbuilding industry expanding by a third, but a serious depression hit the economy by 1922.&lt;ref&gt;N. K. Buxton, &quot;Economic growth in Scotland between the Wars: the role of production structure and rationalization&quot;, ''Economic History Review,'' Nov 1980, vol. 33 (4), pp. 538-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Robertson, &quot;Clydeside revisited: A reconsideration of the Clyde shipbuilding industry 1919-1938&quot; in W. H. Chaloner and B. M. Ratcliffe, eds., ''Trade and Transport: Essays in Economic History in Honour of T. S. Willan'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977), pp. 258-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Finlay, &quot;National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the 'end of Scotland', 1920-1939,&quot; ''History,'' June 1994, vol. 79, (256), pp. 242-59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few industries did grow, such as chemicals and whisky, which developed a global market for premium &quot;Scotch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;. B. Weir, ''The History of the Distillers Company, 1877-1939: Diversification and Growth in Whisky and Chemicals'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among industrial workers.&lt;ref name=Hearn2000p45/&gt;

===Interwar politics===
After World War I the Liberal Party began to disintegrate and Labour emerged as the party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands. As a result the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared [[Bolshevik]] revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Devine&amp;Finlay1996pp64-5/&gt; The fear of the left had been fuelled by the emergence of a radical movement led by militant trades unionists. [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John MacLean]] emerged as a key political figure in what became known as [[Red Clydeside]], and in January 1919, the British Government, fearful of a revolutionary uprising, deployed tanks and soldiers in central Glasgow. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base in the Irish Catholic working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing and rent issues. However, the &quot;Reds&quot; operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; in the face of heavy unemployment the workers' mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;I. McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish educated [[Andrew Bonar Law]] led a Conservative government from 1922 to 1923&lt;ref name=Quinault2007/&gt; and another Scot, [[Ramsey MacDonald]], would be the Labour Party's first Prime Minister in 1924 and again from 1929-35.&lt;ref name=Quinault2007/&gt; 

With all the main parties committed to the Union, new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the [[National Party of Scotland]] in 1928 and [[Scottish Party]] in 1930. They joined to form the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in 1934, with the goal of creating an [[Scottish independence|independent Scotland]], but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.&lt;ref name=Cooke&amp;Stenevson2000p93&gt;C.

As in World War I, [[Scapa Flow]] in [[Orkney]] served as an important [[Royal Navy]] base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and [[Rosyth]] gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[East Lothian]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Wykeham, ''Fighter Command'' (Manchester: Ayer, 1979), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in [[Glasgow]] and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the [[Luftwaffe]], enduring great destruction and loss of life.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p51&gt;J.

Creswell, ''Sea Warfare 1939-1945'' (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2nd edn., 1967), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shetland]]'s relative proximity to occupied [[Norway]] resulted in the [[Shetland Bus]] by which fishing boats helped Norwegians flee the [[Nazis]], and expeditions across the [[North Sea]] to assist resistance.&lt;ref&gt;D. Howarth, ''The Shetland Bus: A WWII Epic of Escape, Survival, and Adventure'' (Guilford, DE: Lyons Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Significant individual contributions to the war effort by Scots included the invention of radar by [[Robert Watson-Watt]], which was invaluable in the [[Battle of Britain]], as was the leadership at [[RAF Fighter Command]] of Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Finlay, ''Modern Scotland: 1914-2000'' (Profile Books, 2004), pp. 162-97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In World War II, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] appointed Labour politician [[Tom Johnston (politician)|Tom Johnston]] as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in February 1941; he controlled Scottish affairs until the war ended. He launched numerous initiatives to promote Scotland, attracting businesses and new jobs through his new Scottish Council of Industry. He set up 32 committees to deal with social and economic problems, ranging from juvenile delinquency to sheep farming. He regulated rents, and set up a prototype national health service, using new hospitals set up in the expectation of large numbers of casualties from German bombing. His most successful venture was setting up a system of hydro electricity using water power in the Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, ''The Scottish Nation, 1700-2000'' (Penguin Books, 2001), pp. 553-4.&lt;/ref&gt; A long-standing supporter of the [[Home Rule]] movement, Johnston persuaded Churchill of the need to counter the nationalist threat north of the border and created a Scottish Council of State and a Council of Industry as institutions to [[devolved government|devolve]] some power away from [[Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Walker, ''Thomas Johnston'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988), pp. 153 and 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, despite extensive bombing by the Luftwaffe, Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p51/&gt; Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by {{convert|2|in|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;T.

===End of mass migration===
While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War,&lt;ref name=Thompson1990pp9-10/&gt; it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p51/&gt; The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate.

===Literary renaissance===
[[File:Hughmacdiarmid.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A bust of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] in [[South Gyle]], [[Edinburgh]].]]
{{Main|Scottish Renaissance|Literature of Scotland}}
In the early 20th century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by [[modernism]] and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance.&lt;ref name=VisitingArtsScotland&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish 'Renaissance' and beyond |journal=Visiting Arts: Scotland: Cultural Profile |url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/scotland/Directories/Scotland_Cultural_Profile/-5403.html |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62yGHJmza |archivedate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading figure in the movement was [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] (the pseudonym of Christopher Murray Grieve). MacDiarmid attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature in poetic works including &quot;[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]&quot; (1936), developing a form of [[Synthetic Scots]] that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms.&lt;ref name=VisitingArtsScotland/&gt; Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets [[Edwin Muir]] and [[William Soutar]], the novelists [[Neil Gunn]], [[George Blake]], [[Nan Shepherd]], [[A J Cronin]], [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Eric Linklater]] and [[Lewis Grassic Gibbon]], and the playwright [[James Bridie]]. All were born within a fifteen-year period (1887 and 1901) and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school, they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues.&lt;ref name=VisitingArtsScotland/&gt;

===Educational reorganisation and retrenchment===
{{Main|History of education in Scotland}}
In the 20th century the centre of the education system became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, but despite attempts to raise it to 15 this was only made law in 1939 and then postponed because of the outbreak of war. In 1918 [[Roman Catholic]] schools were brought into the state system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; 

The first half of the 20th century saw Scottish universities fall behind those in England and Europe in terms of  participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.&lt;ref&gt;C. Harvie, ''No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-Century Scotland'' (1998), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval role===
Scotland's [[Scapa Flow]] was the main base for the Royal Navy in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Konstam, ''Scapa Flow: The Defences of Britain's Great Fleet Anchorage 1914-45'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Cold War]] intensified in 1961, the United States deployed [[Polaris ballistic missile]]s, and submarines, in the [[Firth of Clyde]]'s [[Holy Loch]]. Public protests from [[CND]] campaigners proved futile. The [[Royal Navy]] successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own ''Polaris''-class submarines, and indeed did obtain them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened for [[Resolution class submarine|''Resolution'' class]] [[Polaris missile|Polaris]] submarines at the expanded [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane Naval Base]] on the [[Gare Loch]]. The first patrol of a [[Trident missile|Trident]]-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marr, ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2009), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
After World War II, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of [[North Sea]] oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. This period saw the emergence of the [[Scottish National Party]] and movements for both [[Scottish independence]] and more popularly [[devolution]]. However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40% of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal.)

===Politics and devolution===

[[File:Scottish Parliament building, Holyrood.jpg|thumb|right|Scottish Parliament building, Holyrood, opened in 2004 and intended to evoke the crags of the [[Scottish landscape]] and, in places, upturned [[Fishing industry in Scotland|fishing boats]].]]
In the second half of the 20th century the Labour Party usually won most Scottish seats in the Westminster parliament, losing this dominance briefly to the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionists]] in the 1950s. Support in Scotland was critical to Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only two UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945 and 1966).&lt;ref&gt;L. Bennie, J. Brand and J. Mitchell, ''How Scotland Votes'' (Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists (known as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ball and I. Holliday, ''Mass Conservatism: the Conservatives and the Public Since the 1880s'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians with Scottish connections continued to play a prominent part in UK political life, with Prime Ministers including the Conservatives [[Harold Macmillan]] (whose father was Scottish) from 1955–57 and [[Alec Douglas-Home]] from 1963-64.&lt;ref name=Quinault2007/&gt;

The [[Scottish National Party]] gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974.&lt;ref name=Cooke&amp;Stenevson2000p93/&gt; However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the necessary support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Cooke&amp;Stenevson2000p93/&gt; The introduction in 1989 by the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]-led [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of the [[Community Charge]] (widely known as the Poll Tax), one year before the rest of the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= | title=The poll tax in Scotland 20 years on |journal=BBC News |date=1 April 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7976782.stm| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5z1QIoBOX| archivedate =27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electoral success of New Labour in 1997, which would be led by two Prime Ministers with Scottish connections, Tony Blair (who was brought up in Scotland) from 1997 to 2007 and [[Gordon Brown]] from 2007–10,&lt;ref name=Quinault2007/&gt; opened the way for constitutional change. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]], the [[Tony Blair|Blair]] led [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999. A [[coalition]] government, which would last until 2007, was formed between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with [[Donald Dewar]] as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | title = Devolution to Scotland | journal = BBC News| date = 14 October 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/2321531.stm| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5z1QsnTG4| archivedate =27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Scottish Parliament Building]], adjacent to [[Holyrood House]] in [[Edinburgh]], opened in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2000/00g01ag.pdf |format=PDF|title=The New Scottish Parliament at Holyrood |publisher=Audit Scotland, Sep 2000 |accessdate=10 December 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206171310/http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2000/00g01ag.pdf |archivedate = 6 December 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of [[mixed member proportional representation]].

===Economic reorientation===
{{Main|Economy of Scotland}}
[[File:Oil platform in the North SeaPros.jpg|thumb|left|A [[drilling rig]] located in the [[North Sea]].]]
After World War II, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;W. Knox, ''Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800 – present'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1999), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of [[North Sea]] oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant [[Forties oilfield]] in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant [[Brent oilfield]] in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;J. Vickers and G. Yarrow, ''Privatization: an Economic Analysis'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 6th edn., 1995), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Payne, &quot;The end of steelmaking in Scotland, c. 1967-1993&quot;, ''[[Scottish Economic and Social History]]'', 1995, vol. 15 (1), pp. 66-84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Finlay, ''Modern Scotland: 1914-2000'' (Profile Books, 2004), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This included a resurgent financial services industry and the [[electronics manufacturing]] of [[Silicon Glen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = H.

===Religious diversity and decline===
{{Main|Religion in Scotland}}
[[File:Wfm glasgow central mosque front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow Central Mosque]], the largest [[mosque]] in Scotland.]]
In the 20th century existing Christian denominations were joined by other organisations, including the [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches. Although some denominations thrived, after World War II there was a steady overall decline in church attendance and resulting church closures for most denominations.&lt;ref name=Ditchfield1998p91/&gt; Talks began in the 1950s aiming at a grand merger of the main Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist bodies in Scotland. The talks were ended in 2003,  when the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] rejected the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/kirk_rejects_move_to_form_super_church_1_648784 &quot;Kirk rejects move to form 'super Church'&quot;], ''The Scotsman'', 20 May 2003. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious situation was also been altered by immigration, resulting in the growth of non-Christian religions. In the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] 42.4 per cent of the population identified with the Church of Scotland, 15.9 per cent with Catholicism and 6.8 with other forms of Christianity, making up roughly 65 per cent of the population (compared with 72 per cent for the UK as a whole). Of other religions [[Islam]] was at 0.8 per cent, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]] were all at around 0.1 per cent. Other religions together accounted for 0.6 per cent of respondents and 5.5 per cent did not state a religion. There were 27.5 per cent who stated that they had no religion (which compares with 15.5 per cent in the UK overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= | title=Analysis of Religion in the 2001 Census| journal = The Scottish Government| date = 17 May 2006| url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5zFDvPpbp| archivedate =6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=  | title = Religious Populations | journal = Office for National Statistics| date = 11 October 2004 | url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5zFDlspeL| archivedate =6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other more recent studies suggest that those not identifying with a denomination, or who see themselves as non-religious, may be much higher at between 42 and 56 per cent, depending on the form of question asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= | title=Religion and belief: some surveys and statistics | journal = British Humanist Association | date = 24 June 2004 | url = http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-surveys-statistics | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5zEhZVCoO| archivedate =6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Educational reforms===
{{Main|Scottish education}}
Although plans to raise the school leaving age to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result secondary education was the major area of growth in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the [[Scottish Certificate of Education]] [[Ordinary Grade]] ('O-Grade') and [[Higher Grade]] ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; The higher education sector expanded in the second half of the 20th century, with four institutions being given university status in the 1960s ([[University of Dundee|Dundee]], [[Heriot-Watt University|Heriot-Watt]], [[University of Stirling|Stirling]] and [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]) and five in the 1990s ([[University of Abertay|Abertay]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[Napier University|Napier]], [[University of Paisley|Paisley]] and [[Robert Gordon University|Robert Gordon]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. Newel, &quot;Scottish higher education policy and funding&quot;, in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (2003), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; After devolution, in 1999 the new [[Scottish Executive]] set up an Education Department and an [[Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department (Scotland)|Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department]].&lt;ref name=Fairley2003&gt;J.

Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (2003), pp. 132-40.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|student tuition fees]] in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.&lt;ref name=Cauldwell2003&gt;D. Cauldwell, &quot;Scottish Higher Education: Character and Provision&quot;, in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (2003), pp. 62-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New literature===
{{Main|Literature of Scotland}}
[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Carol Ann Duffy]] the first Scottish [[Poet Laureate]].]] 
Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including [[Robert Garioch]] and [[Sydney Goodsir Smith]]. Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them [[Norman MacCaig]], George Bruce and [[Maurice Lindsay]].&lt;ref name=VisitingArtsScotland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=P.
