      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16862">'''Axial Age''' or '''Axial Period''' ([[German language|Ger.]] ''Achsenzeit'', &quot;axis time&quot;) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] to describe the period from 800 to 200 BC, during which, according to Jaspers, similar revolutionary thinking appeared in   [[Persia]], [[India]], [[China]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. The period is also sometimes referred to as the '''Axis Age'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion | author=Meister, Chad | year=2009 | publisher=Routledge | location=Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers, in his ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''), identified a number of key Axial Age thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers saw in these developments in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]] a striking parallel without any obvious direct transmission of ideas from one region to the other, having found no recorded proof of any extensive intercommunication between [[Ancient Greece]], the Middle East, India, and China. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared. Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the first millennium BC has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==A pivotal age==
Jaspers argued that during the Axial Age &quot;the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page image].&lt;/ref&gt;  These foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment.

===Thinkers and movements===
Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]]. [[Parsva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Fisher | first =Mary Pat | title =Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year =1997 | location =London | isbn =1-86064-148-2 }} p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title =Parshvanatha  | encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica  | volume =Encyclopædia Britannica Online  | year =2007  | url =http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9058576  | accessdate =2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (23rd Tirthankara in 9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]], (24th [[Tirthankara]] in 6th century BCE), known as the fordmakers of [[Jainism]] lived during this age.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mahavira.&quot; Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 2006. Answers.com 28 Nov. 2009. http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira&lt;/ref&gt; They propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and asceticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first =Robert J. | authorlink =Robert_J._Zydenbos | title =Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher =Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location =München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html }}pp. 11, 56-57, 59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period. In China, [[Confucianism]] arose during this era, where it remains a profound influence on social and religious life. [[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is crucial to the development of [[monotheism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1979|isbn=0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; -- although Jaspers uses the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid-era]] estimate for the founding of Zoroastrianism, which is actually the date of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]' unification of [[Persia]]. The exact date of [[Zarathustra]]'s life is debated by scholars with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce1979&quot;/&gt; Others, such as William W. Malandra and R.C. Zaehner suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malandra1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W. Malandra|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|year=1983|isbn=0-8166-1114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers also included the authors of the [[Upanishads]], [[Lao Tzu]], [[Homer]], [[Socrates]], [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Archimedes]], [[Elijah]], [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], and [[Deutero-Isaiah]] as axial figures. Jaspers held [[Socrates]], [[Confucius]] and [[Siddhartha Gautama]] in especially high regard, describing each of them as an exemplary human being and ''paradigmatic personality''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaspers1962&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaspers|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Jaspers|others=[[Hannah Arendt]], trans.|title=The Great Philosophers: The Foundations|publisher=Ralph Manheim|location=London|year=1962|pages=99–105}} cited in {{cite book|first=Karen|last=Armstrong|authorlink=Karen Armstrong|year=2006|title=The Great Transformation: The Beginning of our Religious Traditions|edition=First edition|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-676-97465-1 |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as The Great Leap of Being, constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voegelin1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Voegelin|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Voegelin|series=Collected Works of Eric Voegelin|volume=18|title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, Missouri|publisher=The University of Missouri Press|year=2000|origyear=1985|isbn=978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

===Characteristics of the Axial Age===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline.]]

Jaspers described the Axial Age as &quot;an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaspers51&quot;&gt;Jaspers, 1953, p.51 quoted in Armstrong, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Axial Age represents an in-between period, a period where old certainties had lost their validity and where new ones were still not ready, it has also been suggested that the Axial Age can be considered a historically liminal period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomassen&quot;&gt;{{cite Book | last=Thomassen | first=Bjorn | authorlink=Bjorn Thomassen | title=Anthropological Theory 10(4)
| year=2010 | pages= 321-342 | chapter=&quot;Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate&quot; | chapterurl=http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;Jaspers was particularly interested in the similarities in circumstance and thought of the Age's figures. These similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Neville | first=Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity
| url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age%22&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+features&amp;sig=2wLXXJ8inaZVTI7zaznSW865seg | year=2002 | publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=0-7914-5424-X | page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenstadt&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Eisenstadt | first=S. N. | authorlink=Shmuel Eisenstadt | title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations
| year=1986 | publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter=Introduction | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=intitle:Axial+intitle:Age+intitle:civilizations&amp;sig=q1ep_bbzAp6bAwg5KgaTyVK9d1k }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalised, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. These scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in China, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]; in India, [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]]; in Persia, the religion of [[Zoroaster]]; in [[Canaan]], [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, [[sophism]] and other classical philosophy.

Jaspers argues that these characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.

Anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that &quot;the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graeber&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=978-1-933633-86-2|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an &quot;ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graeber&quot;&gt;Graeber, 2011, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

== The term and the theory ==
The word ''axial'' in the phrase ''Axial Age'' means pivotal. The name comes from Jaspers' use of the German word ''Achse'', which means both &quot;[[Axis of rotation|axis]]&quot; and &quot;[[Lever|pivot]]&quot;.

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Karl Jaspers | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Szakolczai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition=First edition hardcover | publisher=Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415253055&amp;id=hGduSwFHFSEC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&amp;sig=O9S_5-pSxgMIPz8Ocn8RrgofkPU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoST&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter=Historical sociology | publisher=Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415290465&amp;id=LrBrWXtez8YC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Axial+Age&amp;dq=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&amp;sig=g0mBSYAPnOEiXYGHR-j8hpuQPVM | page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that [[Max Weber]]'s work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenstadt&quot; /&gt; Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoST&quot; /&gt; In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

Religious historian [[Karen Armstrong]] explored the period in her ''The Great Transformation'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Karen | last=Armstrong | authorlink=Karen Armstrong | year=2006 | title=The Great Transformation: The Beginning of our Religious Traditions | edition=First edition | publisher=Knopf | location=New York | isbn=0-676-97465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conference&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Strath, Bo | year=2005 | title=Axial Transformations | url=http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?/Personal/Strath/archive/past_conferences/axialtrans.htm | accessdate=2006-06-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a &quot;Second Axial Age&quot;, including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmstrongSecond&quot;&gt;Armstrong, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; and that religion today needs to return to the transformative Axial insights.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmstrongReturn&quot;&gt;Armstrong, pp.390-399&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it has been suggested that the [[modern era]] is a new axial age, wherein traditional relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Yves Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= | pages= 303|url= http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
