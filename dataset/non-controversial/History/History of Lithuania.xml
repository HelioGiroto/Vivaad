      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91553">The '''history of Lithuania''' dates back to at least 1009, the first recorded written use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gudavičius, Edvardas (1999) ''Lietuvos Istorija: Nuo Seniausių Laikų iki 1569 Metų (Lithuanian History: From Ancient Times to the Year 1569)''  Vilnius, page 28, ISBN 5-420-00723-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuanians]], a branch of the [[Balts|Baltic peoples]], later conquered neighboring lands, establishing the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and in the 13th century the short-lived [[Kingdom of Lithuania]]. The Grand Duchy was a successful and lasting warrior state. The Duchy remained fiercely independent and was one of the last areas of Europe to adopt [[Christianity]]. In the 15th century, [[Lithuania]] became the largest state in [[Europe]] through the conquest of much of [[East Slavs|East Slav]] populated [[Ruthenia]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bideleux. A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change. Routledge, 1998. p.122&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Duchy, a formidable power, [[Union of Krewo|formed in 1385]] a [[Jagiellon dynasty|dynastic union]] with [[Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Poland]] and [[Christianization of Lithuania|became Christianized]], [[Union of Lublin|merging into]] the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569. In 1795, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was erased from the political map with the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Commonwealth]]. Afterwards the Lithuanians lived under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]] until the 20th century.

On February 16, 1918, Lithuania was reestablished as a democratic state. It remained independent until the outset of [[World War II]], when it was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] under the terms of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Following a brief occupation by [[Nazi Germany]] when the Nazis declared war on the [[Soviet Union]], Lithuania was again absorbed into the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years. In the early 1990s, [[Lithuania]] [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|restored its sovereignty]] and in the following years [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|became integrated]] into the [[European Union|European political structures]].

==Before statehood==
=== Early settlement ===
[[Image:Kernave piliakalniai.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Kernavė]] mounds]]

The first people arrived on the territory of modern Lithuania in the 10th millennium BC after the glaciers had retreated and the [[last glacial period]] had ended. According to historian [[Marija Gimbutas]], the people came from two directions: from the [[Jutland]] Peninsula and from present-day [[Poland]]. They brought two different cultures as evidenced by the tools they used. They were traveling hunters and did not form more stable settlements. In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer and forests developed. The inhabitants traveled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and fresh water fishing. During the 6th–5th millennium BC, various animals were domesticated, dwellings became more sophisticated and could shelter larger families. Agriculture did not arrive until the 3rd millennium BC, because of demanding climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land. Crafts and trade also started to form at this time. 
Speakers of North-Western [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] might have arrived with the [[Corded Ware culture]] around 3200/3100 BC.&lt;ref&gt; CARPELAN, C.&amp; PARPOLA, ASKO: Emergence, contacts and dispersal of Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Uralic and Proto-Aryan in archaeological perspective.

===Baltic tribes===
[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|250px|left|[[Balts|Baltic tribes]] in the 13th century]] 
The first Lithuanians were a branch of an ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European group]] known as the [[Balts]], whose tribes also included the original [[Old Prussians|Prussia]]n and [[Latvian people|Latvian]] people. The Baltic tribes were not directly influenced by the [[Roman Empire]], but they did maintain close trade contacts (see [[Amber Road]]).

The first known reference to Lithuania as a nation (&quot;Litua&quot;) comes from the [[Annals of Quedlinburg|annals]] of the [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Monastery of Quedlinburg]] and is dated March 9, 1009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Origin of the Name of Lithuania | journal=Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=Fall 2009 | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | issn=0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the two remaining Baltic nationalities are Lithuanians and Latvians, but there were more Baltic nationalities or tribes in the past. Some of these have merged into the Lithuanians and Latvians ([[Samogitians]], [[Selonians]], [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]]), while others no longer exist ([[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Sambians]], [[Skalvians]], [[Galindians]]).

===Formation of Lithuanian state===
During the 11th century, Lithuanian territories were included in the list of lands paying tribute to [[Kievan Rus']], but by the 12th century, the Lithuanians were invading neighboring territories themselves. The military and plundering activities of the Lithuanians triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania, which initiated the formation of early statehood, from which the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] developed.

===Pagan Lithuania===

{{Main|History of Lithuania (1219–1295)}}

In 1219, [[List of early Lithuanian dukes|twenty-one Lithuanian dukes]] signed a peace treaty with [[Galicia–Volhynia]]. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] were uniting and consolidating.&lt;ref name=gerutis&gt;{{cite book |last=Jakštas |first=Juozas |editor= Albertas Gerutis (ed.) |others= translated by Algirdas Budreckis|title= Lithuania: 700 Years |year=1984 |edition=6th |publisher= Manyland Books|location= New York|isbn=0-87141-028-1 |pages=45–50 |chapter=Beginning of the State}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 13th century, two [[Germany|German]] [[religious order]]s, the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]], conquered much of the area that is now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], in addition to parts of Lithuania. In response, a number of small Baltic tribal groups united under the rule of [[Mindaugas]], who is referred to as the ruler of all Lithuania in the [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]] in 1236.&lt;ref name=LV-Mind&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius |coauthors=Rimantas Jasas | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Mindaugas |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-01535-8 |pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lithuanians, led by [[Vykintas]], soundly defeated the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Brothers]] in the [[Battle of Saule]] in 1236, which forced the Brothers to merge with the Teutonic Knights.&lt;ref name=&quot;kiaupa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kiaupa |first=Zigmantas |coauthors= Jūratė Kiaupienė, Albinas Kunevičius |title= The History of Lithuania Before 1795 |chapter=Establishment of the State |origyear= 1995|edition= English|year= 2000|publisher= Lithuanian Institute of History|location= Vilnius|isbn= 9986-810-13-2|pages=45–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1250, Mindaugas entered into an agreement with the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic Order]]; he consented to receive baptism (the act took place in 1251) and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return.&lt;ref name=voruta&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite journal |first=Tomas |last=Baranauskas |authorlink=Tomas Baranauskas |year=2003 | month=March 23, |title=Mindaugo karūnavimo ir Lietuvos karalystės problemos | url= http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=87 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20051026174819/http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=87 | archivedate= 2005-10-26 | journal=[[Voruta (newspaper)|Voruta]] | volume=6 | issue=504 | id=ISSN 1392-0677 | accessdate =2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 1251, [[Pope Innocent IV]] signed two [[papal bull]]s, ordering the Bishop of [[Chełmno]] to crown Mindaugas as [[King of Lithuania]], appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral.&lt;ref name=MGweb&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite journal |last=Butkevičienė |first= Birutė | coauthors= Vytautas Gricius |year=2003 |month=July |title=Mindaugas — Lietuvos karalius |journal= Mokslas ir gyvenimas |volume=7 |issue=547 |pages= |id=ISSN 0134-3084 |url=http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2003/07/7mlk.html |accessdate= 2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1253, Mindaugas was crowned and the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} Tomas Baranauskas.

[[Traidenis]]' reign (1269-1282) was the longest and most stable regime during the period of unrest. After his death, the German orders finalized their conquests of Baltic tribes and they could concentrate on Lithuania.&lt;ref name=cd-831&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite book |last=Kiaupa |first=Zigmantas |title=Gimtoji istorija.

The brothers [[Vytenis]] and [[Gediminas]], the founders of the [[Gediminids|Gediminid dynasty]], united various groups into one Lithuania. In 1316, Grand Duke Gediminas, the first of the leaders responsible for Lithuania's great expansion that was to follow,&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 392&quot;&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe: A History]]'', p. 392, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, ISBN 0-06-097468-0&lt;/ref&gt; with the aid of colonists from Germany, began restoration of the land. 

Gediminas extended the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the east by challenging the [[Mongols]] who, at that time, [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|controlled large areas of Rus']]. Through alliances and conquest, in competition with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], the Lithuanians eventually gained control of significant parts (western and southern portions) of the formerly [[Kievan Rus']] territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 392&quot;/&gt; This area included most of modern [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] (the [[Dnieper River]] basin) and created a massive Lithuanian state that in the 15th century stretched from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 392&quot;/&gt;

Gediminas was slain and his son [[Algirdas]] suppressed the monasteries. Algirdas took [[Kiev]] in 1362 after defeating the Mongols at the [[Battle of Blue Waters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 392&quot;/&gt; Algirdas' son, [[Jogaila]], again made overtures to the Teutonic Order and concluded a secret treaty with them. His uncle [[Kęstutis]] took him prisoner and a [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384)|civil war]] (1381–1384) ensued. Kęstutis was eventually captured, imprisoned and put to death, but Kęstutis's son [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]], the future Grand Duke, escaped.

===Christian Lithuania, dynastic union with Poland===

As the power of Lithuanian warlord dukes expanded to the south and east, the cultivated [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[Ruthenia]]ns moved in the opposite direction within their new statehood and exerted influence on the Lithuanian ruling class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 17-18&quot;&gt;[[Timothy D. Snyder|Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 17-18, 2003 New Haven &amp; London, Yale University Press, ISBN 978-0-300-10586-5&lt;/ref&gt; They brought with them the [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian religion, written [[Old East Slavic|Slavic language]], the version of which known as [[Church Slavonic language|Chancery Slavonic]] was to serve the Lithuanian court's document-producing needs for a few centuries, and developed laws, turning [[Vilnius]] into a major center of [[Kievan Rus'|their civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 17-18&quot;/&gt; By the time of Jogaila's acceptance of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] at the [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385, the establishment of his realm and members of his family had been to a large extent [[Christianization of Lithuania|assimilated into the Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 17-18&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Witold Duke of Lithuania seal.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Grand Duke [[Vytautas]], a Lithuanian hero, was [[Jogaila]]'s first cousin and rival]]
[[Jogaila]], a Grand Duke since 1377, was himself still a pagan. He agreed to become a Catholic when offered the Polish crown and the child queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] by leading Polish nobles, who were eager to take advantage of Lithuania's expansion. Lithuania's close [[History of Poland|association with Poland]] had thus begun, and lasted, in one form or another, for nearly five centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 4&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For the near future Poland gave Lithuanians a valuable ally against increasing threats from the [[Teutonic Knights]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]. 

Jogaila's baptism and the crowning as the [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] in 1386 were followed by the final and official [[Christianization of Lithuania]]. After two [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392)|civil wars]] [[Vytautas the Great]] became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392. During his reign Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion, centralization of the state had begun, and the [[Lithuanian nobility]] became increasingly prominent in state politics. The Lithuanian-Polish alliance was able to defeat the mighty Teutonic Knights at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410. The [[Jagiellon dynasty]], founded by Jogaila, ruled Poland and Lithuania continuously until 1572.

[[Image:Lithuanian state in 13-15th centuries.png|thumb|225px|[[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 13-15th centuries]]

The [[personal union|dynastic link]] to Poland resulted in [[Catholic Church|religious]], political and cultural ties and increase of [[Western culture|Western influence]] among the native Lithuanian nobility, and to a lesser extent among the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] [[boyar]]s from [[Culture of ancient Rus|the East]], Lithuanian subjects. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was preserved as a separate state with separate institutions. Many cities were granted the German system of laws ([[Magdeburg rights]]), with the largest of these being Vilnius, since 1322 the capital of the Grand Duchy.

[[Lithuanian Civil War (1431–1435)|After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas]], the Lithuanian nobility at times attempted to break the union between Poland and Lithuania, independently selecting Grand Dukes from the Jagiellon dynasty. Lithuania however needed a close alliance with Poland when, at the end of the 15th century, the growing power of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] threatened some of Lithuania's [[Rus' people|Rus']] principalities and sparked the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] and later the [[Livonian War]].

===Lithuanian Renaissance===

[[File:Mazvydo katekizmas.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Martynas Mažvydas]]'s ''Catechism'' was published in the [[Lithuanian language]] in 1547]]

From the 16th to the mid-17th century culture, arts, and education flourished, fueled by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. [[Francysk Skaryna]], who wrote and published in his [[Belarusians|native Ruthenian]] ([[Old Belarusian language|Old Belarusian]]) language, was typical in this respect of the earlier phase of the Renaissance in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which lasted until the middle of the 16th century, when [[Polish language|Polish]] predominated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 21&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Many educated [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]] came back from studies abroad and the Grand Duchy was boiling with active cultural life, sometimes referred to as [[Lithuanian Renaissance]] (not to be confused with [[Lithuanian National Revival]] in the 19th century).

At the time Italian architecture was introduced in Lithuanian cities, and [[Lithuanian literature]] written in [[Latin]] flourished. Also at that time the first handwritten and printed texts in the [[Lithuanian language]] emerged, and the formation of written Lithuanian language began. The process was led by Lithuanian scholars [[Abraomas Kulvietis]], [[Stanislovas Rapalionis]], [[Martynas Mažvydas]] and [[Mikalojus Daukša]].

With the [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569 Poland and Lithuania formed a new state: the Republic of Both Nations (commonly known as Poland-Lithuania or the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; Polish: ''Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów'', Lithuanian: ''Abiejų Tautų Respublika''). The Commonwealth, which officially consisted of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], was ruled by Polish and Lithuanian nobility, together with kings, who were [[Royal elections in Poland|elected by the nobles]].

Following the union, [[Polonization]] increasingly affected all aspects of Lithuanian public life; it took well over a century for the process to be completed. The 1588 [[Statutes of Lithuania|Statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the earlier legal codifications were written in the Ruthenian Chancery Slavonic language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 44&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1700 [[Polish language|Polish]] was used in official documents; the [[Ruthenian language]] and [[Latin]] had been utilized in the Grand Duchy's written transactions prior to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'', p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuania's ruling families and nobility]] had become linguistically and culturally Polonized, while retaining a sense of Lithuanian nationality. The [[Lithuanian language]] fell into disuse in the circles of the grand dukes' courts in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 18-19&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; A century later Polish was commonly used by ordinary Lithuanian nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 18-19&quot;/&gt; The Lithuanian language however survived, despite the encroachments of the Ruthenian, Polish, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[German language|German]] languages, as a peasant vernacular and [[Martynas Mažvydas|from 1547]] in written religious use.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominantly [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] population of the territorially expanded Grand Duchy was by and large [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and so was the [[Lithuanian nobility]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 22&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the common people of the Lithuanian realm, at about the time of the [[Union of Lublin|union with Poland]] large portion of the Lithuanian state's nobility converted to [[Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 22&quot;/&gt; Following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] movement many noble families converted to [[Calvinism]] in the 1550s and 1560s, and typically a generation later, conforming to the [[Counter-Reformation]] trends in the Commonwealth, to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 22&quot;/&gt; However, according to an undoubtedly exaggerating early 17th century source, &quot;merely one in a thousand remained a Catholic&quot; in Lithuania at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban 30&quot;&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Wacław Urban]], ''Epizod reformacyjny'' (The Reformation episode), p.30.

The Union of Lublin and the integration of the two countries notwithstanding, for over two centuries Lithuania continued to exist as the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, retaining separate laws as well as an army and a treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Daniel. ''The Polish–Lithuanian state: 1386–1795''. University of Washington Press, 2001. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of [[Union of Lublin|the Union]] King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] removed the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] territories from Lithuania and incorporated them into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]].

These liberties, especially the ''[[liberum veto]]'', led to political anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state.

The Commonwealth was greatly weakened by a series of wars, beginning in 1648 with [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky|Khmelnytsky]]'s [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack uprising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 24&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Northern War|Northern Wars]] (1655–1661), the Lithuanian territory and economy were [[Deluge (history)|devastated by the Swedish army]]. Before it could fully recover, Lithuania was again ravaged during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). The war, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|a plague]], and [[Great Frost of 1709|a famine]] resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the country's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.liw.lt/archive_vid.php?shid=1211283347&amp;id=1211283055 The Roads to Independence]&quot;. Lithuania in the World.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign powers, especially Russia, became dominant players in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth. Numerous factions among the nobility used their &quot;[[Golden Liberty]]&quot; to prevent any reforms.

The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution]] of May 3, 1791, a culmination of the belated reform process of the Commonwealth, was passed by the [[General sejm|Sejm]] (central legislature). It attempted to integrate Lithuania and Poland more closely, although the separation was kept by the added [[Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations]]. [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795 terminated the existence of the Commonwealth and saw the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided between Russia and Prussia. Lithuania ceased to exist as a distinct entity for more than a century.

Following the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania, including [[Vilnius]], which was a part of the [[Vilna Governorate]]. In 1803 Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] revived and upgraded the old [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] academy as the imperial [[Vilnius University]], the largest in the Russian Empire. The university and the regional educational system was directed on behalf of [[Alexander I of Russia|the Tsar]] by Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski|Adam Czartoryski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 26-27&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the 19th century, there were signs that Lithuania might be allowed some separate recognition by the Empire, however this had never happened.

[[File:Simonas Daukantas.png|thumb|left|175px|[[Simonas Daukantas]]]]

These hopes were soon to be dashed, particularly subsequent to 1812, when Lithuanians eagerly welcomed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[Grande Armée|French army]] as liberators, with many joining his [[French invasion of Russia|offensive against Russia]]. After the French army's defeat and withdrawal, Tsar Alexander I decided to keep the University of Vilnius open and the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] was able to receive his education there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 27&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The south-western part of Lithuania included in Prussia in 1795 and in the short-lived [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807 became a part of the Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1815, while the rest of Lithuania continued to be administered as a Russian province.

Lithuanians and Poles revolted twice, in 1831 and 1863, but both attempts had failed and resulted in increased repression by the Russian authorities. After the [[November Uprising]] of 1831, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] began an intensive program of [[Russification]] and the University of Vilnius was closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 28&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish language schooling and cultural life were however largely able to continue in the former Grand Duchy, until the failure of the 1863 [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 44&quot;/&gt; The [[Statutes of Lithuania|Statutes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] were annulled by the Russian Empire only in 1840, and [[Emancipation reform of 1861|serfdom was abolished]] in 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 44-45&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union of Brest|Uniate Church]], important in the [[Belarus]] part of the former Grand Duchy, was incorporated into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] in 1839.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 45&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kostuś Kalinowski.PNG|thumb|right|165px|[[Konstanty Kalinowski]]]]

The poetry of Adam Mickiewicz, emotionally attached to the Lithuanian setting and exploring Lithuania's medieval themes, influenced ideological foundations of the emerging Lithuanian national movement. [[Simonas Daukantas]], who studied with Mickiewicz at [[Vilnius University|Vilnius]], promoted a return to Lithuania's pre-[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] traditions and a renewal of the local culture, based on the [[Lithuanian language]]. With those ideas in mind he wrote already in 1822 (at that time not published) a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian. [[Teodor Narbutt]] wrote in Polish a voluminous ''Ancient History of the Lithuanian Nation'' (1835–1841), where he likewise expounded and expanded further the concept of historic Lithuania, whose days of glory had ended with the [[Union of Lublin|union with Poland]] (1569). Narbutt, invoking the German scholarship, pointed out the relationship between the Lithuanian and [[Sanskrit]] languages. It indicated the closeness of Lithuanian (preserved in considerable isolation from historic era foreign influences) to its old [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] roots and would later provide the &quot;antiquity&quot; argument for the [[Lithuanian National Revival|national revival]] activists. By the middle of the 19th century the basic ideology of the future [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement had thus been defined; it required, in order to establish a modern Lithuanian identity, a break with the Polish (early modern) tradition and cultural-linguistic dependence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 31-35, 37-38&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 31-35, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the January Uprising, there was a generation of Lithuanian leaders of the transitional period, between the Grand Duchy-oriented, bound with Poland, and the modern nationalist Lithuanian language-based movement. [[Jakób Gieysztor]], [[Konstanty Kalinowski]] and [[Antanas Mackevičius]] wanted to form alliances with the local (Lithuanian and Belarusian speaking) peasants, who, empowered and given land, would presumably help defeat the Russian Empire, acting in their own self-interest. This created new dilemmas that had to do with languages used for such inter-class communication, and later led to the concept of a nation as the &quot;sum of speakers of a vernacular tongue&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 26, 30&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 26, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;

The 1864 failure of the January Uprising made on the one hand the Polish connection seem of no further practical use to Lithuanians, while on the other led to the creation of a class of emancipated and even prosperous Lithuanian peasants, custodians of the Lithuanian language. Educational opportunities, now more widely available also to young people of such common origins, were one of the crucial factors responsible for the [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian revival]]. As schools were being de-Polonized and Lithuanian university students sent to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] or [[Moscow]] rather than [[Warsaw]], a cultural void resulted and it was not being successfully filled by the attempted [[Russification]] policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 31-33&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Russian Empire]] regarded the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] realm that ought to be (and was being) &quot;reunited&quot; with Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 49-51&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 49-51&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades however, a national, Lithuanian ethnicity-based movement emerged. It was composed of activists of different social backgrounds and persuasions, often primarily Polish speaking, but united by their willingness and zeal to promote the Lithuanian culture and language as a strategy for building a modern nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 31-33&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auksa altorius latin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|1864 Lithuanian language prayer book; it was printed in the [[Latin]] alphabet and therefore prohibited]]

In 1864 the Lithuanian language and the Latin alphabet were banned in junior schools. Lithuanians resisted the Russification by arranging printing abroad and smuggling the books in by ''[[knygnešiai]]''. The tsarist authorities implemented a number of Russification policies, including a [[Lithuanian press ban|ban on Lithuanian press]] and the closing of cultural and educational institutions. Lithuania became part of a new administrative region called [[Northwestern Krai]] (the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania).&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 60&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian nobles]] were Polonized and only the poor and middle classes used Lithuanian (some of the latter also preferred to use Polish), Lithuanian was not considered a prestigious language. There were even expectations that the language would become extinct, as more and more territories in the east were Slavicized, and more people used Polish or Russian in daily life. The only place where Lithuanian was considered more prestigious and worthy of books and studying was German-controlled [[Lithuania Minor]]. Even there, [[Germanisation|an influx of German immigrants]] threatened the native language and culture.

The language was already present among poor people and the language revival spread into more affluent strata, beginning with the release of Lithuanian newspapers, [[Aušra]] and [[Varpas]], then with the writing of poems and books in Lithuanian. These writings glorified the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], depicting the historic nation of great power and with many heroes.

[[Image:Ausra newspaper.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Aušra]]'', originally spelled ''Auszra'', formulated the ideas of Lithuanian nationalism]]

The two most prominent figures in the revival movement, [[Jonas Basanavičius]] and [[Vincas Kudirka]], both originated from affluent Lithuanian peasantry and both attended the [[Marijampolė]] (Mariampol) secondary school in the [[Suwałki|Suvalkai]] region, where [[serfdom]] had been eliminated in 1807, the time of [[Napoleon]]'s takeover. The school was a Polish educational center, Russified after the [[January Uprising|Uprising]], with the Lithuanian language classes introduced at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 33-34&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Basanavičius studied medicine at [[Moscow State University|Moscow]], where he developed international connections, published in Polish on Lithuanian history and graduated in 1879. From there he went to [[Bulgarian National Revival|Bulgaria]], and in 1882 moved to [[Prague]]. In Prague he met and became influenced by the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Czech National Revival|national movement]] activists. In 1883 Basanavičius began working on a Lithuanian language review, which assumed the form of a newspaper named ''Aušra'' (The Dawn). Published in German [[East Prussia]], ''Aušra'' was written in the [[Latin]] script, banned under the Russian rule where [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] characters were required for printing in Lithuanian, and was smuggled to Lithuania. The review (forty issues in total), building on the work of the earlier writers, sought to establish continuities with the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Grand Duchy of Lithuania and exalted the Lithuanian common people in their role as the conduit of that (essential for the national revival) continuity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder34-35&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jonas Basanavicius (1851-1927).jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Jonas Basanavičius]], a preeminent figure in the [[Lithuanian National Revival]] movement]]

Russian restrictions at Marijampolė secondary school were eased in 1872 and Kudirka, enrolled at that time, learned Polish there. He went on to study at the [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw imperial university]], where he was influenced by Polish [[socialism|socialists]]. In 1889 Kudirka returned to Lithuania and worked on incorporating Lithuanian peasantry into mainstream politics, as the main building block of a modern nation. In 1898 he wrote a poem inspired by the opening strophe of Mickiewicz's masterpiece ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', using the poet's famous invocation in a different language and for a differently understood, but resonating with the patriotism of the original, national purpose. The poem became the [[national anthem]] of Lithuania (''Tautiška Giesmė'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder38-40&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival spearheaded the independence movement, with various organizations opposing Russian influence. Russian policy became harsher in response. Attacks took place against Catholic churches while a ban forbidding Lithuanian press continued.

The period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet.  The majority of these were published in [[Tilsit]], a city in [[East Prussia]], although some publications reached Lithuania from the [[United States]]. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and [[Aukštaitija]]n (highland) usages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lki.lt/index.php?test=206] Lithuanian Language Institute Abstracts.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters -č-, -š- and -v- were taken from the modern (redesigned) [[Czech language|Czech]] orthography, to avoid the Polish usage for corresponding sounds.&lt;ref name=gied&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/classes/lith/lith410/SUB_2004_double_orthography_SCHMA.pdf Double Orthography in American Lithuanian Newspapers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century].

Lithuania's [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement continued to grow.  During the Russia-wide [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolutionary uprising of 1905]], a large congress of Lithuanian representatives in Vilnius known as the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] demanded provincial autonomy for Lithuania (by which they meant the lesser northwestern portion of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the territory they considered [[ethnic group|ethnically]] Lithuanian, including [[Vilnius Region|Vilnius and surrounding areas]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 53&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 December of that year. The tsarist regime made a number of concessions as the result of the 1905 uprising. The [[Baltic states]] could once again use their native languages in schooling and public discourse. The [[Latin script]] replaced the [[Cyrillic script]] which had been forced upon Lithuanians for four decades. However, not even Russian liberals were prepared to concede autonomy similar to that that had already existed in Estonia and Latvia, albeit under [[Baltic German]] hegemony. Many Baltic Germans looked toward aligning the Baltics (Lithuania and [[Courland]] in particular) with Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBNAE&quot;&gt;Hiden, John and Salmon, Patrick. The Baltic Nations and Europe. London: Longman. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of hostilities in [[World War I]] Germany occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. Vilnius fell to the Germans on 19 September 1915. An alliance with Germany in opposition to both tsarist Russia and Lithuanian nationalism became for the Baltic Germans a real possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBNAE&quot; /&gt; Lithuania was incorporated into [[Ober Ost]], occupational German government.&lt;ref name=maks&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite book| first=Mindaugas |last=Maksimaitis |title=Lietuvos valstybės konstitucijų istorija (XX a. pirmoji pusė) |publisher=Justitia |location=Vilnius |year=2005 |isbn=9955-616-09-1 |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As open annexation could result in a public relations backlash, the Germans planned to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be completely dependent on Germany, the so-called [[Mitteleuropa]].&lt;ref name=eidintas&gt;{{cite book |last=Eidintas |first=Alfonsas |coauthors=Vytautas Žalys, Alfred Erich Senn |editor=Ed.

[[File:Vilnius Conference 1917.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Presidium and secretariat of the [[Vilnius Conference]]]]

The Germans allowed the [[Vilnius Conference]] (18–22 September 1917) to convene (elections for a formal representative assembly were not permitted), demanding that Lithuanians declare loyalty to Germany and agree to an annexation. The Conference instead announced basic principles of a limited in territorial scope, but independent [[ethnic group|ethnic]] [[Lithuania|Lithuanian state]], with cultural rights for the minorities; accordingly, the publication of the Conference's resolution was not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Council of Lithuania | year = 1970–1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapočius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 581–585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference elected a 20-member [[Council of Lithuania]] (''Taryba'') and empowered it to act as the executive authority of the Lithuanian people.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; The Council declared on 11 December Lithuanian independence as a German [[protectorate]], and then adopted the outright [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] on 16 February 1918.

To prevent being incorporated into the [[German Empire]], Lithuanians elected [[Monaco]]-born King [[Mindaugas II of Lithuania|Mindaugas II]] as the titular monarch of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)|Kingdom of Lithuania]] in July 1918. Mindaugas II never assumed the throne.

[[File:Signatarai.Signatories of Lithuania.jpg|thumb|left|235px|The original twenty members of the [[Council of Lithuania]]]]

In the meantime, initially also under the German occupation, an attempt to revive the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a socialist multinational federal republic took place. [[Anton Lutskevich]] and his [[Belarusian National Council]] proclaimed in March 1918 the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], which was to stretch from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]] and include Vilnius. Lutskevich and the Council fled the approaching [[Red Army]] and left [[Minsk]] before it was taken over by the [[Bolshevik]]s in December 1918. Upon their arrival in Vilnius, they proposed a Belarusian-Lithuanian federation, which however generated no interest on the part of the Lithuanian leaders, who were in advanced stages of promoting national plans of their own. The Lithuanians were interested only in a state &quot;within ethnographic frontiers&quot;, as they perceived it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 60-61&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany lost the war and signed the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice of Compiègne]] on 11 November 1918. Lithuanians quickly formed their first government, led by [[Augustinas Voldemaras]], adopted a provisional constitution, and started organizing basic administrative structures. As the German army, defeated in [[Western Front (World War I)|the West]], was withdrawing from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], it was followed by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet forces]], whose intention was to spread the global [[proletarian revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 61&quot;/&gt; They created a number of [[puppet state]]s, including on 16 December 1918 the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–1919)|Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By the end of December the Red Army reached Lithuanian borders, starting the [[Lithuanian–Soviet War]].

[[File:Augustinas Voldemaras.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Augustinas Voldemaras]], Lithuania's first Prime Minister]]  

On 1 January 1919 the German occupying army withdrew from Vilnius turning the city over to local Polish self-defense forces. The Lithuanian government evacuated Vilnius and moved west to [[Kaunas]], which became the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]]. Vilnius was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 5 January 1919. As the Lithuanian army was in its infant stages, the Soviet forces moved largely unopposed and by mid-January 1919 controlled about ⅔ of the Lithuanian territory. Vilnius was now the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Republic, and soon of the combined [[Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian–Belarusian]] Soviet Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 61-62&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 1919, the Lithuanian–Soviet War went parallel with the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. Polish troops captured Vilnius from the Soviets on 21 April 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 62&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Poland had territorial claims over Lithuania, especially the [[Vilnius Region]], and these tensions spilled over into the [[Polish–Lithuanian War]]. [[Józef Piłsudski]] of Poland,{{Ref label|b|b|none}} seeking a Polish-Lithuanian federation, but unable to find common ground with Lithuanian politicians, in August 1919 made an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Lithuanian government in Kaunas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 62-65&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 62-65&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mid-May the Lithuanian army, commanded by General [[Silvestras Žukauskas]], began an offensive against the Soviets in northeastern Lithuania. By the end of August 1919, the Soviets were pushed out of the Lithuanian territory. The Lithuanian army was then deployed against the paramilitary [[West Russian Volunteer Army]], who invaded northern Lithuania. They were Germany-reactivated and supported German and Russian soldiers who sought to retain German control over the former Ober Ost. West Russian Volunteers were defeated and pushed out by the end of 1919. Thus the first phase of the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]] was over and Lithuanians could direct attention to internal affairs.

===Democratic Lithuania===

The [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania]] was elected in April and first met in May 1920. In June it adopted the third provisional constitution and on 12 July 1920 signed the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty]]. In the treaty the Soviet Union recognized fully independent Lithuania and its claims to the disputed [[Vilnius Region]]; Lithuania secretly allowed the Soviet forces passage through its territory, as they moved against Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 63&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1920, the advancing Soviet army captured Vilnius for a second time from Polish forces. However, they only handed the city over to Lithuanians on 26 August 1920, following the defeat of the Soviet offensive. The victorious Polish army returned and the Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty increased [[Polish–Lithuanian War|hostilities between Poland and Lithuania]]. To prevent further fighting, the [[Suwałki Agreement]] was signed on 7 October 1920; it left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the armistice line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 63-65&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 63-65&lt;/ref&gt; It had never gone into effect, because Polish General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]], acting on [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s orders, [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|staged a military action presented as a mutiny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 63-65&quot;/&gt; He invaded Lithuania on 8 October 1920, captured Vilnius the following day, and established a short-lived [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] on 12 October 1920.

However, the negotiations broke down as neither side agreed to the compromise.

The Constituent Assembly, which adjourned in October 1920 due to threats from Poland, gathered again and initiated many reforms needed in the new state: obtained international recognition and membership in the [[League of Nations]], passed the law of land reform, introduced national currency [[Lithuanian litas|litas]], and adopted the final constitution in August 1922. Lithuania became a democratic state, with [[Seimas]] (parliament) elected by men and women for a three-year term. The Seimas elected the president. The [[First Seimas of Lithuania|First Seimas]] was elected in October 1922, but could not form a government as the votes split equally 38–38, and was forced to resign. Its only lasting achievement was the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] from 10-15 January 1923. Lithuania took advantage of the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|Ruhr Crisis]] and captured the [[Klaipėda Region]], a territory detached from [[East Prussia]] according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and placed under French administration. The region was incorporated as an autonomous district of Lithuania in May 1924. For Lithuania it was the only access to the [[Baltic Sea]] and an important industrial center. The Revolt was the last armed conflict in Lithuania before World War II. The [[Second Seimas of Lithuania|Second Seimas]], elected in May 1923, was the only Seimas in independent Lithuania that served the full term. The Seimas continued the land reform, introduced social support systems, started repaying foreign debt. Strides were made in education: the network of primary and secondary schools was expanded and first universities were established in Kaunas. A [[Lithuanian census of 1923|national census]] took place in 1923.

===Authoritarian Lithuania===
[[File:Antanas Smetona 2.jpg|thumb|[[Antanas Smetona]], the first and last president of independent Lithuania during the [[interbellum]]. The 1918–1939 period if often known as &quot;Smetona's time&quot;.]]
The [[Third Seimas of Lithuania|Third Seimas]] was elected in May 1926. For the first time [[Lithuanian Christian Democrats]] (''krikdemai'') lost their majority and became an opposition. It was sharply criticized for signing the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact]] (Lithuanian claim to Poland-held Vilnius was recognized  by the Soviets again)&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 78-79&quot;/&gt; and accused of &quot;Bolshevization&quot; of Lithuania. As a result of growing tensions, the government was deposed during the [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état]] in December. The coup, organized by the military, was supported by the [[Lithuanian Nationalists Union]] (''tautininkai'') and Lithuanian Christian Democrats. They installed [[Antanas Smetona]] as the President and [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] as the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=vardys&gt;{{cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |coauthors=Judith B. Sedaitis |title=Lithuania: The Rebel Nation |publisher=WestviewPress |year=1997 |series=Westview Series on the Post-Soviet Republics |isbn=0-8133-1839-4 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smetona suppressed the opposition and remained as an authoritarian leader until June 1940.

The Seimas thought that the coup was just a temporary measure and new elections should be called to return Lithuania to democracy. The legislative body was dissolved in May 1927. Later that year members of the Social Democrats and other leftist parties, named ''plečkaitininkai'' after their leader, tried to organize an uprising against Smetona but were quickly subdued. Voldemaras grew increasingly independent of Smetona and was forced to resign in 1929. Three times in 1930 and once in 1934 he unsuccessfully attempted to return to power. In May 1928 Smetona, without the Seimas, announced the fifth provisional constitution. It continued to claim that Lithuania is a democratic state and vastly increased powers of the President. His party, the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]], steadily grew in size and importance. Smetona adopted the title of &quot;tautos vadas&quot; (leader of the nation) and slowly started building personality cult. Many of the prominent political figures married into Smetona's family ([[Juozas Tūbelis]], [[Stasys Raštikis]]).

When the [[Nazi Party]] came into power in the [[Weimar Republic]], Germany–Lithuania relations worsened considerably as [[Nazi Germany]] did not accept the loss of the [[Klaipėda Region]]. The Nazis sponsored anti-Lithuanian organizations in the region. In 1934, Lithuania put the activists on trial and sentenced about 100 people, including their leaders Ernst Neumann and Theodor von Sass. That prompted Germany, one of the main trade partners of Lithuania, to declare [[embargo]] of Lithuanian products. In response Lithuania shifted its exports to Great Britain. But that was not enough and peasants in [[Suvalkija]] organized strikes, which were violently suppressed. Smetona's prestige was damaged and in September 1936 he agreed to call the first elections to Seimas since the coup of 1926. Before the elections all political parties, except the National Union, were eliminated. Thus of the 49 members of the [[Fourth Seimas of Lithuania|Fourth Seimas]], 42 were from the National Union. It functioned as an advisory board to the President and in February 1938 adopted a new constitution, which granted the President even greater powers.

[[File:Lithuania territory 1939-1940.svg|thumb|left|275px|Lithuanian territorial issues 1939-1940]]

As tensions were rising in Europe following the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] by Nazi Germany, [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|Poland presented an ultimatum to Lithuania]] in March 1938. Poland demanded the re-establishment of normal diplomatic relations, which were broken after the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] in 1920, and threatened military actions in case of refusal. Lithuania, having a weaker military and unable to enlist international support for its cause, accepted the ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 78-79&quot;/&gt; [[Lithuania–Poland relations]] somewhat normalized and the parties concluded treaties regarding railway transport, postal exchange, and other means of communication. Just a year after the Polish ultimatum and five days after the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], Lithuania [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|received as oral ultimatum]] from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanding to cede the Klaipėda Region to Germany. Again, Lithuania was forced to accept. This triggered a political crisis in Lithuania and forced Smetona to form a new government which for the first time since 1926 included members of the opposition. The loss of Klaipėda was a major blow to Lithuanian economy and the country shifted to the sphere of German influence. When Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] concluded the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939 and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 80&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1939, [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], with secret clauses assigning [[spheres of influence]] in the area of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Lithuania with Vilnius, initially assigned to the German sphere of influence, was transferred to the Soviet sphere in secret additional protocols of the [[German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty]] of September 28, 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 80&quot;/&gt; Vilnius, regarded by Lithuanians as their capital, but under Polish control [[interwar period|before the war]], was occupied by the Red Army on 19 September 1939 during the [[invasion of Poland]]; Lithuania petitioned [[Soviet Union|Moscow]] for the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 80&quot;/&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] apparrently overruled the Soviet government circles inclined to grant Vilnius to the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 80-81&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Pact]] of 10 October 1939 transferred a part of the [[Vilnius Region]] previously held by Poland, including Vilnius, to Lithuanian  control in exchange for the stationing of 20,000 Soviet troops within Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania established its state authority in Vilnius and under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Antanas Merkys]] proceeded with [[Lithuanization]] of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt;

Once the [[Winter War]] in Finland was over and Germany was making rapid advances [[Operation Weserübung|against Denmark and Norway]] and [[Battle of France|against France and the Low Countries]], the Soviets heightened their diplomatic pressure on Lithuania, culminating in the [[1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania]] of June 14, 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; The ultimatum demanded the formation of a new pro-Soviet government and admission of an unspecified number of Russian troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; Lithuania, already partially controlled by Soviet forces and unable to effectively resist, accepted the ultimatum. President [[Antanas Smetona]] fled Lithuania as the Soviet military (15 divisions with 150,000 soldiers) crossed the Lithuanian border on June 15, 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; Lithuania lost its independence and was about to be incorporated into the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 72&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:194006 soviet occupation lithuania.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Red Army|Soviet troops]] marching into Lithuania (June 1940)]]
Soviet representative [[Vladimir Dekanozov]] formed the new pro-Soviet puppet government, known as the People's Government. [[Justas Paleckis]] replaced Smetona as the acting President of Lithuania. The new government was a rubber stamp institution, carrying out orders from Moscow. The [[Fourth Seimas]] was disbanded and new [[show election]]s to the so-called [[People's Seimas]] were organized on July 14–15, 1940. With only communist-led Lithuanian People's Bloc candidates running and under conditions of general terror, official results showed over 90% [[voter turnout]] and 95% support for the Bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; During its first session on July 21, the People's Seimas unanimously voted to convert Lithuania into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and petitioned to join the Soviet Union. The application was approved by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] on August 3, which completed the formalization of the annexation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; By August 6 the Republic was subjected to a complete Red Army control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt; Twenty to thirty thousand Lithuanians, Poles and Jews were deported by the Soviet [[NKVD]] to [[Siberia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and elsewhere between June 1940 and June 1941, including Lithuanian Prime Minister Merkys and Foreign Minister [[Juozas Urbšys]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 82-83&quot;/&gt;

Immediately following the occupation, Soviet authorities began rapid [[Sovietization of the Baltic states|Sovietization of Lithuania]]. All land was [[nationalized]]. To gain support for the new regime among the poorer peasants, large farms were distributed to small landowners. However, in preparation for eventual [[collectivization]], agricultural taxes were dramatically increased in an attempt to bankrupt all farmers. Nationalization of banks, larger enterprises, and real estate resulted in disruptions in production causing massive shortages of goods. The [[Lithuanian litas]] was artificially undervalued and withdrawn by spring 1941. The standard of living plummeted. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were banned leaving only the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] and its youth branch. Estimated 12,000 &quot;[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]&quot; were arrested. During the [[June deportation]] some 17,000 people (mostly former military officers, policemen, political figures, intelligentsia and their families) were deported, under the policy of elimination of national elites,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 83-84&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Gulags]] in Siberia, where many perished due to inhumane conditions.

===Nazi occupation===

====Collaboration and resistance====

On 22 June 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 72&quot;/&gt; The German forces moved rapidly, encountering only sporadic Soviet resistance. Vilnius was captured on 24 June 1941,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 84&quot;/&gt; and within a week Germany controlled all Lithuania. The retreating Soviet forces massacred Lithuanian political prisoners (see [[Rainiai massacre]]). The Lithuanians generally greeted the Germans as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime and hoped that Germany would restore some autonomy to Lithuania. The [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] organized anti-Soviet [[June Uprising in Lithuania|June Uprising]], declared independence, and formed the [[Provisional Government of Lithuania]] with [[Juozas Ambrazevičius]] as Prime Minister. The Provisional Government was not forcibly dissolved, but stripped of any actual power; it resigned on August 7, 1941. The Germans established the civil administration, known as the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. The Germans did not have enough manpower to staff local administration; therefore, most local offices were headed by the Lithuanians. Policy decisions would be made by high-ranking Germans and actually implemented by low-ranking Lithuanians. Overall, local self-government was quite developed in Lithuania and helped to sabotage or hinder several German initiatives, including raising a [[Waffen-SS]] unit or providing men for [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor in Germany]].

[[Image:Steponas Kairys.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Steponas Kairys]] was the first chairman of the [[Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania]]]]

There was substantial cooperation and collaboration between the German forces and some Lithuanians. The [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] volunteered a police force, known as [[Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas]] (TDA), hoping that it would be later transformed into regular army of independent Lithuania. Instead these units were employed by the Germans as auxiliary in massacres of the Jews during [[the Holocaust]]. Another infamous unit was the [[Lithuanian Security Police]] (Saugumo policija) operating in Vilnius. A number of other police battalions were formed; the auxiliary forces were sometimes employed outside of Lithuania and charged with securing communications, guarding prisoners, delivering supplies, etc. Harsh German policies of settling ethnic Germans in Lithuania, collecting large war provisions, gathering people for forced labor, conscripting men into the German army etc. soon produced a resistance movement. The most notable resistance organization, the [[Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania]], was formed in 1943. Despite German pressure a [[Waffen-SS]] division was not established in Lithuania. Eventually, the Lithuanian general [[Povilas Plechavičius]] agreed to form the [[Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force]] (LTDF), which was to operate solely in the Lithuanian territory and be commanded by Lithuanian officers. When Germans did not honor the agreement and attempted to subordinate LTDF to the German army, Plechavičius disbanded it in May 1944.

Lithuanians also organized armed resistance, which was conducted by pro-[[Soviet partisans]], operated in eastern Lithuania, and mainly consisted of minority Russians, Belarusians and Jews. This group fought for the re-incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Soviet partisans committed a number of atrocities (for example, the [[Koniuchy massacre]]) and sacked towns and villages.&lt;ref name = &quot;Genocid&quot;&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www.genocid.lt/Leidyba/1/audrone.htm Audronė Janavičienė.

The Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK) also operated in eastern Lithuania, expecting post-war Poland to resume control of the [[Vilnius Region]]. AK was fighting not only against the Nazis, but also against the pro-Nazi Lithuanian police involved in attacks on Poles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 84&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force]], and the Soviet partisans. Relationships between different national military organizations were often adversarial and [[Polish–Lithuanian relations during World War II|became only more hostile and retributive as the war went on]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 84&quot;/&gt;

Unlike in other Nazi-occupied countries where the Holocaust was introduced gradually, [[Einsatzkommando|Einsatzgruppe A]] started executions in Lithuania on first days of war.  Executions of Jews on a mass scale took place in Lithuania before the practice had spread to other occupied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 84&quot;/&gt; The executions were carried out in three main groups: in Kaunas ([[Ninth Fort]]), in Vilnius ([[Ponary massacre]]), and in the countryside ([[Rollkommando Hamann]]).

The [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|mass deportation]] campaigns of 1941–1952, the [[June deportation]] according to [[Serov Instructions]] and the [[March deportation]] known as Operation &quot;Priboi&quot;, exiled tens of thousands of families to [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced settlements]] in [[Siberia]] and other remote parts of the [[Soviet Union]]. Official statistics{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} state that more than 120,000 people were deported from Lithuania during this period, while researchers estimate the number of political prisoners and deportees at 300,000. In response to these events, approximately 100,000 of [[Lithuanian partisans|local organized resistance fighters]] participated in unsuccessful partisan warfare against the Soviet regime from 1944 to 1952. An estimated 30,000 partisans and their supporters were killed and many more were arrested and deported to [[Siberia]]n [[gulag]]s. The last partisan was killed in combat in 1965. Soviet authorities encouraged immigration of non-Lithuanian workers, especially Russians, as a way of integrating Lithuania into the Soviet Union and to encourage industrial development. However, to a great extent, [[Lithuanization]] rather than [[Russification]] had taken place in postwar Vilnius and elements of national revival characterize the period of Lithuania's existence as a Soviet republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snyder 72&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|d|d|none}} The communist era is memorialized in [[Grūtas Park]].

Until mid-1988, all political, economic, and cultural life was controlled by the [[Communist Party of Lithuania|Lithuanian Communist Party]] (LCP). Lithuanians as well as people in two other [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] distrusted the Soviet regime even more than people in other regions of the Soviet state, and gave their own specific and active support to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s program of social and political reforms known as [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Under the leadership of intellectuals, the Lithuanian reform movement &quot;[[Sąjūdis|Lietuvos persitvarkymo sąjūdis]]&quot; (the Reform Movement of Lithuania) was formed in mid-1988 and declared a program of democratic and national rights, winning nationwide popularity. Inspired by Sąjūdis, the [[Lithuanian Supreme Soviet]] passed constitutional amendments on the supremacy of Lithuanian laws over Soviet legislation, annulled the 1940 decisions on proclaiming Lithuania a part of the USSR, legalized a multi-party system, and adopted a number of other important decisions, including the return of the national state symbols — the [[flag of Lithuania|flag]] and the [[Tautiška giesmė|anthem]]. A large number of LCP members also supported the ideas of Sąjūdis, and with Sąjūdis support, [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] was elected First Secretary of the Central Committee of the LCP in 1988. On 23 August 1989, 50 years after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], in order to draw the world's attention to the fate of the Baltic nations, Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians joined hands in a human chain that stretched 600 kilometres from [[Tallinn]], to [[Riga]], to Vilnius. The human chain was called the [[Baltic Way]]. In December 1989, the Brazauskas-led LCP declared its independence from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and became a separate party, renaming itself in 1990 the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]].

In early 1990, Sąjūdis-backed candidates won the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1990|elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=281&amp;p_d=3248&amp;p_k=2 |title=Supreme Council (Reconstituent Seimas) 1990-1992 |date=1999-12-07 | publisher=Seimas |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 1990, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR|Supreme Soviet]] proclaimed the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|re-establishment of Lithuanian independence]]. The Baltic republics were in the forefront of the struggle for independence and Lithuania was the first of the Soviet republics to declare independence. [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] became the head of the state and [[Kazimira Prunskienė]] led the Cabinet of Ministers. On March 15, the Soviet Union demanded revocation of the independence and began employing political and economic sanctions against Lithuania. Soviet military was used to seize a few public buildings, but violence was largely contained until January 1991. During the [[January Events]], the Soviet authorities attempted to overthrow the elected government by sponsoring the so-called National Salvation Committee. The Soviets forcibly took over the [[Vilnius TV Tower]], killing 14 unarmed civilians and injuring 700.&lt;ref name=bbc-onthisday&gt;{{cite news|title=On This Day 13 January 1991: Bloodshed at Lithuanian TV station|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4059000/4059959.stm|accessdate=2011-09-13|date=13 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow failed to act further to crush the Lithuanian independence movement and the Lithuanian government continued to work.

During the national referendum on February 9, 1991, more than 90% of those who took part in the voting (76% of all eligible voters) voted in favor of an independent, democratic Lithuania. During the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]] in Moscow, Soviet military troops took over several communications and other government facilities in Vilnius and other cities, but returned to their barracks when the coup failed. The Lithuanian government banned the Communist Party and ordered confiscation of its property. Following the failed coup, Lithuania received widespread international recognition and was admitted to the [[United Nations]].

===Contemporary Republic of Lithuania (1991–present)===

[[File:Flag of Lithuania.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flag of Lithuania]]]]
As in many other formerly Soviet countries, popularity of the independence movement ([[Sąjūdis]] in the case of Lithuania) was diminishing due to worsening economic situation (rising unemployment, inflation, etc.). The [[Communist Party of Lithuania|Lithuanian Communist Party]] renamed itself [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] (LDDP) and ran against Sąjūdis in the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 parliamentary elections]], gaining a majority of the seats. LDDP continued building the independent democratic state and transitioning from a [[planned economy|centrally planned]] to a [[free market economy]]. In the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1996|1996 parliamentary elections]], the voters swinged back to the rightist [[Homeland Union]], led by the former Sąjūdis leader [[Vytautas Landsbergis]].

As part of the transition to a free market economy, Lithuania organized a [[privatization]] campaign to sell government-owned residential real estate and commercial enterprises. The government issued [[investment vouchers]] to be used in privatization instead of actual currency. People cooperated in groups to collect larger amounts of vouchers for the public auctions and the privatization campaign. Lithuania, unlike Russia, did not create a small group of very wealthy and powerful people. The privatization started with small organizations, and large enterprises (such as telecoms or airlines) were sold several years later for hard currency in a bid to attract foreign investors. Lithuania's monetary system was to be based on [[Lithuanian litas|litas]], the currency used during the interwar period. Due to high inflation and other delays a temporary currency, [[Lithuanian talonas|talonas]], was introduced (commonly called ''Vagnorkė'' or ''Vagnorėlis'' after Prime Minister [[Gediminas Vagnorius]]). Eventually litas was issued in June 1993 and it was decided to [[Fixed exchange rate|peg]] it to the [[United States dollar]] in 1994 and to the [[Euro]] in 2002.

Despite Lithuania's achievement of complete independence, sizable numbers of Russian forces remained in its territory. Withdrawal of those forces was one of Lithuania's top foreign policy priorities. Russian troop withdrawal was completed by August 31, 1993. The first military of the reborn country were the [[Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces|Volunteer Forces]], who first took an oath at the Supreme Council of Lithuania soon after the independence declaration. The [[Lithuanian military]] built itself to the common standard with an [[Lithuanian Air Force|air force]], [[Lithuanian Naval Force|navy]] and [[Lithuanian Land Force|land army]]. Interwar paramilitary organisations such as [[Lithuanian Riflemen's Union]], [[Young Riflemen]], and [[Lietuvos Skautija|Lithuanian Scouts]] were reestablished. Seeking closer ties with the West, Lithuania applied for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) membership in 1994. The country had to go through a difficult transition from a planned economy to a free market one, satisfying the requirements for the [[European Union]] (EU) membership. 

In October 2002, Lithuania was invited to join the European Union and one month later to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; it became a member of both in 2004. Large numbers of  Lithuanians have since left in search of better economic opportunities in other EU states, creating a significant for the small country demographic problem.

''a.''{{Note label|a|a|none}}This tiny fraction of Catholics in the early 17th century Grand Duchy is given by [[Kasper Cichocki]] (1545-1616), a Catholic parish priest near [[Sandomierz]], who wrote on the subject of the extent of the heresies in the Commonwealth. According to Wacław Urban, Calvinism and Eastern Orthodoxy predominated, and were followed by Catholicism and the [[Polish Brethren]], with [[Lutheranism]] being numerically the least significant of the Christian denominations in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban 30&quot;/&gt;
