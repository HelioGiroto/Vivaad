{{History of Palestine}}
The '''history of Palestine''' is the study of the past in the region of [[Palestine]], the region between the southern Mediterranean coastal plains and the Syrian interior. Situated at a strategic location between [[Egypt]], [[Greater Syria|Syria]] and [[Arabia]], and the birthplace of the [[Abrahamic religions]], the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous different peoples, including the [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Ancient Israelites]], [[Assyrians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the Muslims, the [[Crusaders]], [[Ayyubids]], [[Mameluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[United Kingdom|British]], The [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] (1948-1967) and modern [[Israelis]] and [[Palestinians]]. Other terms for the same area include [[Canaan]], [[Zion]], the [[Land of Israel]], [[Syria Palaestina]], [[Southern Syria]], [[Jund Filastin]], [[Outremer]], the [[Holy Land]] and the [[Southern Levant]]. Modern archaeologists and historians of the region refer to their field of study as [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology]].

The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and [[civilization]]. During the [[Bronze Age]], independent [[Canaan]]ite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete, and Syria. During 1550–1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]] who held power until the 1178 BCE [[Battle of Djahy|Battle of Djahy (Canaan)]] during the wider [[Bronze Age collapse]]. The [[Philistines]] arrived and mingled with the local population, and according to Biblical tradition, the [[United Monarchy|United Kingdom of Israel]] was established in 1020 BCE and split within a century to form the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]]. The region became part of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] from c. 740 BCE, which was itself replaced by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in c. 627 BCE. A war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the local leaders were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylonia]], only to be allowed to return under the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

In the 330s BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Palestine, and the region changed hands numerous times during the [[wars of the Diadochi]], ultimately joining the [[Seleucid Empire]] between 219–200 BCE. In 116 BCE, a Seleucid civil war resulted in the independence of certain regions including the minor [[Hasmonean]] principality in the [[Judean Mountains]]. From 110 BCE, the [[Hasmoneans]] extended their authority over much of Palestine, creating a [[Judean]]–[[Samaritan]]–[[Idumaean]]–[[Ituraean]]–[[Galilean]] alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MA-4VX5gWS4C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=%22Samaritan-Idumaean-Ituraean-Galilean%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x7zTj67JSg&amp;sig=x5y6WjVwho34sWpdPdIpLxLat3M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qhKzTtCfK8jBswat_aG_BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samaritan-Idumaean-Ituraean-Galilean%22&amp;f=false Cambridge History of Judaism, The early Roman period, Volume 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The Judean (Jewish, see [[Ioudaioi]]) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as [[Judaea]], a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the [[Judean Mountains]]. During 73–63 BCE, the [[Roman Republic]] extended its influence into the region in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], conquering Judea in 63 BCE, and splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. In 70 CE, [[Titus]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|sacked Jerusalem]], resulting in the dispersal of the city's Jews and Christians to [[Yavne]] and [[Pella]]. In 132 CE, [[Hadrian]] joined the province of Iudaea with [[Galilee]] to form the new province of [[Syria Palaestina]], and Jerusalem was renamed &quot;[[Aelia Capitolina]]&quot;. During 259–272, the region fell under the rule of [[Odaenathus]] as King of the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. Following the victory of Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in the [[Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306–324)]], the Christianization of the Roman Empire began, and in 326, [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s mother [[Saint Helena]] visited [[Jerusalem]] and began the construction of churches and shrines. Palestine became a center of [[Christianity]], attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The [[Samaritan Revolts]] during this period caused their near extinction.

Palestine joined the Islamic Empire following the 636 CE [[Battle of Yarmouk]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]]. In 661 CE, with the assassination of [[Ali]], [[Muawiyah I]] became the uncontested Caliph of the Islamic World after being crowned in [[Jerusalem]]. In 691, the [[Dome of the Rock]] became the world's first great work of Islamic architecture. The [[Umayyad]] were replaced by the [[Abbasids]] in 750. From 878 Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], and ending with the [[Ikhshidid]] rulers who were both buried in Jerusalem. The [[Fatimid]]s conquered the region in 969. In 1073 Palestine was captured by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]], only to be recaptured by the [[Fatimid]]s in 1098, who then lost the region to the [[Crusaders]] in 1099. Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until defeat by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. A rump Crusader state in the northern coastal cities survived for another century, but, despite seven further Crusades, the Crusaders were no longer a significant power in the region. The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was indirectly created in [[Egypt]] as a result of the [[Seventh Crusade]]. The [[Mongol Empire]] reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the [[Mongol raids into Palestine]] under [[Nestorian Christian]] general [[Kitbuqa]] and reaching an apex at the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a battle for control over western Asia and the Ottomans captured Palestine in 1516.

In 1832 Palestine was conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s Egypt, but in 1840 Britain intervened and returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans in return for further [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of [[Zionist]] immigration and the [[Revival of the Hebrew language]]. Jewish immigration throughout the century created relatively large Jewish concentrations in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias and Jaffa.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt , Tudor (1987) The Jews in Palestine, 1800–1882. Royal Historical Society studies in history (52). Woodbridge: Published for the Royal Historical Society by Boydell.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] government issued the pro-Zionist [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] during [[World War I]]. The British captured Jerusalem a month later, and were formally awarded a [[British Mandate of Palestine|mandate]] in 1922. The Arab Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929 and 1936. In 1947, following [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], the British Government announced their desire to terminate the Mandate, and the [[United Nations]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] voted to partition the territory. The Arabs rejected the UN partition plan, and a [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] began immediately, with the [[State of Israel]] was declared in 1948. The [[1948 Palestinian exodus|700,000 Palestinians]] who fled or were driven from their homes were unable to return following the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949]]. In the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Israel captured and incorporated more Mandate territory, Jordan [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|captured the region today known as the West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|captured by Egypt]]. In the course of the [[Six Day War]] in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of [[Israeli settlement]]s. From 1987 to 1993, the [[First Intifada|First Palestinian Intifada]] against Israel took place, ending with the [[1993 Oslo Peace Accords]]. In 2000, the Second or [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] began, and Israel built a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|barrier]]. Following [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004]], it withdrew all settlers and most of the military presence from the Gaza strip, but maintained control of the air space and coast.

The earliest human remains in Palestine were found in [[Ubeidiya]], some 3&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (Lake Tiberias), in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. The remains are dated to the [[Pleistocene]], c. 1.5 million years ago. These are traces of the [[early human migration|earliest migration]] of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa. The site yielded [[hand axe]]s of the [[Acheulean]] type.&lt;ref&gt;Galilee, Sea of. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica.

Wadi El Amud between [[Safed]] and the Sea of Galilee was the site of the first prehistoric dig in Palestine, in 1925. The discovery of [[Palestine Man]] in the Zuttiyeh Cave in Wadi Al-Amud near [[Safed]] in 1925 provided some clues to human development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Evolution and Neanderthal Man|publisher=Antiquity Journal|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/034/0090/Ant0340090.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amud.

These [[anatomically modern humans]], both adult and infant, are now dated to about 90–100,000 years old, and many of the bones are stained with [[red ochre]], which is conjectured to have been used in the burial process, a significant indicator of [[ritual|ritual behavior]] and thereby [[symbol]]ic thought and [[intelligence]]. 71 pieces of unused [[red ochre]] also littered the site. Mount Carmel has yielded several important findings, among them [[Kebara Cave]] that was inhabited between 60,000–48,000 [[Before Present|BP]] and where the most complete [[Neanderthal]] [[skeleton]] found to date. The [[Tabun, Israel|Tabun]] cave was occupied intermittently during the Lower and Middle [[Paleolithic age]]s (500,000 to around 40,000 years ago). [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] suggest that it features one of the longest sequences of human occupation in the [[Levant]]. In the nearby [[Es Skhul]] cave excavations revealed the first evidence of the late Epipalaeolithic [[Natufian]] culture, characterized by the presence of abundant [[microliths]], human burials and ground stone tools. This also represents one area where [[Neanderthal]]s—present in the region from 200,000 to 45,000 years ago—lived alongside modern humans dating to 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, S. &lt;u&gt;Mapping Human History.&lt;/u&gt; Houghton Mifflin, New York (2003). p. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the caves of [[Shuqba]] in [[Ramallah]] and Wadi Khareitun in [[Bethlehem]], stone, wood and animal bone tools were found and attributed to the [[Natufian]] culture (c. 12,800–10,300 BCE). Other remains from this era have been found at Tel Abu Hureura, Ein Mallaha, Beidha and [[Jericho]].&lt;ref&gt;Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef, 2000, pp. 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 10,000 and 5000 BCE, agricultural communities were established. Evidence of such settlements were found at Tel es-Sultan in Jericho and consisted of a number of walls, a religious shrine, and a {{convert|23|ft|adj=on}} tower with an internal staircase&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1996, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jericho is believed to be one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world]], with evidence of settlement dating back to 9000 BCE, providing important information about early human habitation in the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Gates, 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the Jericho–[[Dead Sea]]–[[Beersheva|Bir es-Saba]]–[[Gaza]]–[[Sinai]] route, a culture originating in [[Syria]], marked by the use of copper and stone tools, brought new migrant groups to the region contributing to an increasingly urban fabric.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp4&quot;&gt;Shahin (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, 1997, pp. 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Asher Silberman, Thomas E.

By the early Bronze Age (3000–2200 BCE), independent [[Canaan]]ite city-states situated in plains and coastal regions and surrounded by mud-brick defensive walls were established and most of these cities relied on nearby agricultural hamlets for their food needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canaan. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved August 12, 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9019900 Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological finds from the early Canaanite era have been found at [[Tel Megiddo]], Jericho, Tel al-Far'a (Gaza), [[Bet Shean|Bisan]], and [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] ([[Deir Dibwan]]/[[Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate|Ramallah District]]), Tel an Nasbe ([[al-Bireh]]) and [[Jib (village)|Jib]] (Jerusalem). The Canaanite city-states held trade and diplomatic relations with [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. Parts of the Canaanite urban civilization were destroyed around 2300 BCE, though there is no consensus as to why. Incursions by nomads from the east of the [[Jordan River]] who settled in the hills followed soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1990, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (2200–1500 BCE), [[Canaan]] was influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete, and Syria. Diverse commercial ties and an agriculturally based economy led to the development of new pottery forms, the cultivation of grapes, and the extensive use of bronze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=MiddleBronzeAge&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestine: Middle Bronze Age|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2007-08-11|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45048/Palestine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burial customs from this time seemed to be influenced by a belief in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prehistory|volume=8: South and Southwest Asia|edition=1|editor2-first=Peter Neal|editor2-last=Peregrine|editor2-link=Peter N.

===[[New Kingdom|New Kingdom Egyptian]] period===
[[File:Egypt 1450 BC.svg|thumb|left|New Kingdom at its maximum territorial extent in the 15th century BCE]]

During 1550–1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to Egypt as the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]] reunited Egypt and expanded into the [[Levant]] under [[Ahmose I]] and [[Thutmose I]]. Political, commercial and military events towards the end of this period (1450–1350 BCE) were recorded by ambassadors and Canaanite proxy rulers for Egypt in 379 cuneiform tablets known as the [[Amarna Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;William H. Propp &quot;Amarna Letters&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have established that the late 13th, the 12th and the early 11th centuries BCE witnessed the foundation of perhaps hundreds of insignificant, unprotected village settlements, many in the mountains of Palestine.&lt;ref name=LemcheJHS /&gt; From around the 11th century BC, there was a reduction in the number of villages, though this was counterbalanced by the rise of certain settlements to the status of fortified townships.&lt;ref name=LemcheJHS /&gt;

In 1178 BCE, the [[Battle of Djahy|Battle of Djahy (Canaan)]] between [[Ramesses III]] and the [[Sea Peoples]] marked the beginning of the decline in power of the [[New Kingdom]] in the [[Levant]] during the wider [[Bronze Age collapse]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

During the beginning of the [[Iron Age]] (c. 1175 BCE), the [[Philistines]] occupied the southern coast of Canaan, and mingled with the local population, losing their separate identity over several generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp6&quot;&gt;Shahin (2005), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl S.

Archaeological evidence from this era are believed to corroborate some Biblical events. In 925 BCE, Pharaoh [[Sheshonk I]] of the [[Third Intermediate Period]] is recorded to have invaded [[Canaan]] following the [[Battle of Bitter Lakes]], and is thought to be the same as [[Shishak]], the first Pharaoh mentioned in the [[Bible]] who captured and pillaged Jerusalem. There was an at least partial Egyptian withdrawal from Palestine in this period, though it is likely that [[Bet Shean]] was an Egyptian garrison as late as the beginning of the 10th century BCE.&lt;ref name=LemcheJHS /&gt; The [[Kurkh Monolith]], dated c. 835 BCE, describes King [[Shalmaneser III]] of Assyria's [[Battle of Qarqar]], where he fought alongside the contingents of several kings, among them [[King Ahab]] and King [[Gindibu]]. The Mesha Stele, from c. 850 BCE, recounts the conquering of [[Moab]], located East of the [[Dead Sea]], by king [[Omri]], and the successful revolt of Moabian king [[Mesha]] against Omri's son, presumably [[King Ahab]] (and French scholar [[André Lemaire]] reported that line 31 of the Stele bears the phrase &quot;the house of David&quot; (in ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' [May/June 1994], pp.&amp;nbsp;30–37).&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishhistory.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=Assyrian&amp;content=content/house_of_david |title=&quot;House of David&quot; Restored in Moabite Inscription: A new restoration of a famous inscription reveals another mention of the &quot;House of David&quot; in the ninth century BCE |publisher=Jewishhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Sites and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], including the [[Large Stone Structure]], [[Mount Ebal]], the [[Merneptah Stele|Menertaph]], and [[Mesha Stele|Mesha]] stelae, among others, are subject to widely varying historical interpretations: the &quot;conservative camp&quot; reconstructs the history of Israel according to the biblical text and views archaeological evidence in that context, while scholars in the minimalist or deconstructionist school hold that there is no archaeological evidence supporting the idea of a [[United Monarchy]] (or [[Israelite]] nation) and the biblical account is a religious mythology created by Judean scribes in the Persian and Hellenistic periods; a third camp of centrist scholars acknowledges the value of some isolated elements of the [[Pentateuch]] and of Deuteronomonistic accounts as potentially valid history of monarchic times that can be in accord with the archaeological evidence, but argue that nevertheless the biblical narrative should be understood as highly ideological and adapted to the needs of the community at the time of its compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Mazar and Schmidt, 2007, pp. 10–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|title=King David's Palace Is Found, Archaeologist Says |last=Erlanger |first=Steven |date=2005-08-05 |accessdate=2007-05-24 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/international/middleeast/05jerusalem.html?ex=1280894400&amp;en=3c435bc7bd0cd531&amp;ei=5088 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Sturgis, ''It ain't necessarily so'', ISBN 0-7472-4510-X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol A.

[[File:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|left|Neo-Assyrian Empire at its greatest extent]]

Assyrian inscriptions from c. 740 BCE record the military victories of [[Tiglath Pileser III]] in the region, during which period the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] conquered most of the [[Levant]]. The Bible records the Israelite cities becoming [[vassal]]s to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] during this period. At around this time, the [[Siege of Gezer (c. 733 BCE)]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of Jerusalem, is recorded on a stone relief at the Assyrian royal palace in Nimrud. Further military expeditions into the region are recorded in the annals of [[Sargon II|Sargon]] and [[Sennacherib]], as well as in the bible. According to the bible, between 722 and 720 BCE the northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the [[Assyrian Empire]] and the Israelite tribes—thereafter known as the [[Lost Tribes]]—were exiled.&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt; The most important finding from the southern Kingdom of Judah is the [[Siloam Inscription]], dated c. 700 BCE, which celebrates the successful encounter of diggers, digging from both sides of the Jerusalem wall to create the [[Hezekiah's Tunnel|Hezekiah water tunnel]] and water pool, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in {{bibleverse||2Kings|20:20|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, Texts p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, Pictures p. 275, 744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was replaced with the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in c. 627 BCE, following the death of [[Ashurbanipal]] and the successful revolt of [[Nabopolassar]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The region was controlled briefly by Pharaoh [[Necho II]] of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]] between the [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BCE)]] and the [[Battle of Carchemish]] four years later, and further conflict between the Babylonians and the 26th dynasty of Egypt is recorded during 601–586 BCE. According to the bible, this culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem and the [[First Temple]] were destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt; Most of the surviving Israelite leaders, and much of the other local population, were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Babylon&quot; ''A Dictionary of the Bible''.

===[[Achaemenid Empire|Persian (Achaemenid) Empire]] period===
[[File:Map achaemenid empire en.png|thumb|left|Achaemenid Empire under Darius III]]
{{main|Yehud Medinata}}
Following King [[Cyrus the Great]]'s defeat of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Opis]], the region became part of the [[Eber-Nari]] satrapy or [[Districts of the Achaemenid Empire#Fifth district|District number V]] (corresponding the regions of ([[Syria]], [[Phoenicia]], Palestine and [[Cyprus]]) according to [[Herodotus]] and [[Arrian]], which included three administrative areas: Phoenicia, Judah and Samaria, and the Arabian tribes. The Phoenician cities of Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and Aradus were vassal states ruled by hereditary local kings who struck their own silver coins and whose power was limited by the Persian satrap and local popular assemblies. The economies of these cities were mainly based on maritime trade. During military operations, the Phoenicians were obliged to put their fleet at the disposal of the Persian kings. Judah and Samaria enjoyed considerable internal autonomy. Bullae and seal impressions of the end of the 6th and beginning of the 5th centuries mention the province of Judah. Its governors included Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel under Cyrus and Darius I; Nehemiah ; Bagohi, who succeeded Nehemiah and whose ethnicity is difficult to determine; and &quot;Yehizkiyah the governor&quot; and &quot;Yohanan the priest&quot;, known from coins struck in Judah in the 4th century BCE. From the second half of the 5th century the province of Samaria was governed by Sanballat and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;*Dandamaev, M (1994): &quot;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eber-nari]&quot;, in [[Ehsan Yarshater|E.

According to the [[bible]] and implications from the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], [[Jews]] were allowed to return to what their holy books had termed the Land of Israel, and having been granted some autonomy by the Persian administration, it was during this period that the Second Temple in Jerusalem was built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Edelman&gt;{{cite web|title=Redating the Building of the Second Temple|author=Diana Edelman|month=November | year=2005|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Edelman_Redating_Second_Temple.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samaria#Sebastia|Sebastia]], near [[Nablus]], was the northernmost province of the Persian administration in Palestine, and its southern borders were drawn at [[Hebron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=palestineeb&gt;Palestine.

===Hellenic Kingdoms ([[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] / [[Seleucid]] / [[Hasmonean]]) period===

[[File:Rome-Seleucia-Parthia 200bc.jpg|thumb|left|The Seleucid Empire in c. 200 BCE]]
[[File:1stMithritadicwar89BC.png|thumb|left|Hasmonoen Kingdom at its greatest extent under [[Salome Alexandra]]]]

In the late 330s BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, during his six-year [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] conquest of the empire of [[Darius III of Persia]]. Alexander's armies took Palestine without complication while traveling to Egypt after the [[Siege of Tyre]], beginning an important period of Hellenistic influence in the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp7&quot;&gt;Shahin (2005), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;{{cite web|title=Hellenistic Greece:Alexander the Great|publisher=Washington State University|year=1996|accessdate=2007-08-11|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/ALEX.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 323–301 BCE, the region changed hands numerous times during the [[wars of the Diadochi]], with rulers including [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], [[Ptolemy I Soter]] and [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]]. In 312 BCE [[Ptolemy I Soter]] defeated Antigonus' son [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius I]] at the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]], but withdrew from the region shortly thereafter. It is probable that [[Seleucus I Nicator]], then an Admiral under Ptolemy's command, took part in the battle, as following the battle he was given 800 infantry and 200 cavalry and immediately travelled to [[Babylon]] where he founded the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The region was finally re-captured by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] after [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] was killed at the [[Battle of Ipsus]]. Ptolemy had not taken part in the battle, and the victors [[Seleucus I Nicator]] and [[Lysimachus]] had carved up the [[Antigonid]] Empire between them, with Southern Syria intended to become part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Although [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] did not attempt to conquer the area he was due, [[Ptolemy]]'s pre-emptive move led to the [[Syrian Wars]], which began in 274 BCE between the successors of the two leaders. The northern portion of Palestine ultimately fell in to the hands of the [[Seleucid Empire]] in 219 through the betrayal of Governor [[Theodotus of Aetolia]], who had held the province on behalf of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]]. The Seleucids advanced on Egypt, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Raphia]] ([[Rafah]]) in 217. However, in 200 BCE Southern Palestine also fell under the control of the [[Seleucid Empire]] following the [[Battle of Panium]] (part of the Fifth [[Syrian Wars|Syrian War]]) in which [[Antiochus III the Great]] defeated the [[Ptolemies]].&lt;ref name=Freep225&gt;Free and Vos, 1992, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians had not interfered with the internal affairs of the various subject-peoples of the region, but the Greeks followed a policy of deliberate [[Hellenisation]], encouraging, although not normally enforcing, Greek culture. Hellenisation took root first in the densely settled coastal and lowland areas, and only really began to impinge on more backward areas such as Judea in the early 2nd century. According to [[Josephus]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees]], the continued Hellenization of Palestine by the [[Seleucid]]s resulted in an uprising in the [[Judean Mountains]], known as the [[Maccabees|Maccabean Revolt]]. Although the revolt was quelled in 160 BCE at the [[Battle of Elasa]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] entered a period of rapid decline in 145–144 BCE, beginning with the overthrowing of King [[Alexander Balas]] at the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] (the capital of the empire) by [[Demetrius II Nicator]] in alliance with [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] of [[Egypt]], as well as the capturing of [[Seleucia]] (the previous capital of the empire) by [[Mithradates I of Parthia]]. By 116 BCE, a civil war between Seleucid half-brothers [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]] and [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]] resulted in a breakup of the kingdom and the independence of certain principalities, including Judea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j4McAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA465&amp;lpg=PA465&amp;dq=Grypus+Cyzicenus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7r0fLoAPkF&amp;sig=gGC3Sv8xKfBXKYlu2lGklhWiDDk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f4OfTb7pEaS10QG7-b2VBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Grypus%20Cyzicenus&amp;f=false |title=Lectures on ancient history, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Marcus Carsten Nicolaus von Niebuhr |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianbookshelf.org/josephus/the_antiquities_of_the_jews/chapter_10_how_upon_the.htm |title=Josephus, chapter 10 |publisher=Christianbookshelf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Judean leader [[John Hyrcanus]] to carry out the first military conquests of the independent Hasmonean kingdom in 110 BCE, raising a mercenary army to capture [[Madaba]] and [[Schechem]], significantly increasing the regional influence of Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iEj7FA8InCoC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=hyrcanus+medeba+110&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CHjjvpQcZZ&amp;sig=357llCEJ8MiRLcqzffN9MCZYskQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h4GfTZWZOarg0QHWst0q&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hyrcanus%20medeba%20110&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible, Volume 5, William George Smith |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sievers, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hasmoneans]] gradually extended their authority over much of the region, forcibly converting the populations of neighbouring regions, and creating a [[Judean]]-[[Samaritan]]-[[Idumaean]]-[[Ituraean]]-[[Galilean]] alliance in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The Judean (Jewish, see [[Ioudaioi]]) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as [[Judaea]], a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the [[Judean Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/series/series_display/item3937015/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Cambridge History of Judaism|volume=3| page=210 |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of Judea led by [[Pompey]] in 63 BCE, [[Aulus Gabinius]], proconsul of [[Syria (Roman province)#Syria in antiquity|Syria]], split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of legal and religious councils known as [[sanhedrin]] based at Jerusalem, [[Tzippori|Sepphoris]] ([[Galilee]]), [[Jericho]], Amathus ([[Perea (Bible)|Perea]]) and [[Umm Qais|Gadara]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And when he had ordained five councils (συνέδρια), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts.

The three-year [[Ministry of Jesus]], culminating in his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], is estimated to have occurred during 28–30 CE, although the [[historicity of Jesus]] is disputed by scholars.

As a result of the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] (66–73), [[Titus]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|sacked Jerusalem]] destroying the Second Temple, leaving only supporting walls, including the [[Western Wall]]. According to [[Josephus]], the estimated death toll was 250,000–1,100,000.

In 132 CE, the Emperor [[Hadrian]] joined the province of Iudaea (comprising Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea) with [[Galilee]] to form new province of [[Syria Palaestina]]. Jerusalem was renamed &quot;[[Aelia Capitolina]]&quot; and temples were built there to honor Roman gods, particularly [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. In 135 CE, the victory in [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] by [[Hadrian]] resulted in 580,000 Jews killed (according to [[Cassius Dio]]) and destabilization of the region's Jewish population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Jerusalem]] was re-established as the Roman military colony of [[Aelia Capitolina]]; a largely unsuccessful attempt was made to prevent Jews and Christians from living there. Many Jews and Christians left Palestine altogether for the [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]] communities, and large numbers of prisoners of war were sold as [[Slavery|slaves]] throughout the Empire. Christianity in particular was practiced in secret and the [[Hellenization]] of Palestine continued under [[Septimius Severus]] (193–211 CE).&lt;ref name=Shahinp7 /&gt; New pagan cities were founded in Judea at [[Eleutheropolis]] ([[Bayt Jibrin]]), Diopolis ([[Lod|Lydd]]), and [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Nicopolis]] ([[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]]).&lt;ref name=palestineeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shahinp7 /&gt; Some two hundred Jewish communities remained, as gradually certain religious freedoms were restored, such as exemption from the imperial cult and internal self-administration. The Romans made no such concession to the Samaritans, to whom religious liberties were denied, while their sanctuary on Mt.[[Gerizim]] was defiled by a pagan temple, as part of measures were taken to suppress the resurgence of Samaritan nationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehmann&quot; /&gt;

A number of events with far-reaching consequences took place during this period, including further religious [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] between [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism]] such as a council held by the bishops of Palestine in Caesarea in 195 that decreed that [[Easter]] was to be always kept on a Sunday, and not with the [[Jewish Passover]]. The Romans destroyed the community of the Mother Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of Jesus&lt;ref&gt;Whealey, J (2008) &quot;Eusebius and the Jewish Authors: His Citation Technique in an Apologetic Context&quot; (Journal of Theological Studies; Vol 59: 359–362)&lt;/ref&gt; The line of [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Jewish bishops in Jerusalem]], which is claimed to have started with Jesus's brother [[James the Just|James the Righteous]] as its first bishop, ceased to exist, within the Empire. Hans Kung  suggests that the [[Jewish Christians]] sought refuge in Arabia and he quotes with approval a view that this created a paradox of truly world-historical significance that while Jewish Christianity was swallowed up in the Christian church, it preserved itself in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Küng,''Christianity and world religions: paths of dialogue with Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism,'' Orbis Books, 1993 p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 259–272, the region fell under the rule of [[Odaenathus]] as King of the [[Palmyrene Empire]] after the capture of Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] by [[Shapur I]] at the [[Battle of Edessa]] caused the [[Roman Empire]] to splinter until [[Aurelian]] defeated the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrenes]] at the [[Battle of Emesa]] ([[Homs]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Under Byzantine rule, the two dioceses of Palaestina proper became a center of [[Christianity]], while retaining significant [[Jewish]] and [[Samaritan]] communities. Some areas, like Gaza, were well known as pagan holdouts, and remained attached to the worship of [[Dagon]] and other deities as their ancestors had been for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar (1999) Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World Harvard University Press, ISBN 0-674-51173-5 p 553&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghassanid]] Arab migration in the 4th and 5th centuries established an Arab Christian domain with a capital on the Golan, forming a buffer of Christian Byzantium against the wild tribes of Arabia.

The Samaritan self-rule had shortly gained a level of independence under the leadership of [[Baba Rabba]] in late 4th century. However, they were again subdued by Byzantine forces. Samaritan attempts to gain independence from Byzantines peaked during the 5th and 6th centuries in a series of [[Samaritan Revolts]], some of which had messianic aspirations. The outcome of Samaritan strife with Christian Byzantines, supported by [[Ghassanid]] Arabs, turned disastrous.

The [[Nabateans]] roamed the Negev by the Roman Period, and by the Byzantine Period dominated the swath of sparsely populated deserts, from the Sinai to the Negev to the northwest coast of Arabia, the outlands that the Byzantines called the diocese of Palaestina Salutoris (meaning something like &quot;near Palestine&quot;). Its capital Petra was formally the capital of the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]]. The Nabateans also inhabited the outland of Jordan and southern Syria, improperly called the diocese of Arabia because its capital Bostra was within the northern extremity of the Roman province of Arabia Petrae. The origin of the Nabateans remains obscure, but they were [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] speakers, and the term &quot;Nabatean&quot; was the Arabic name for an Aramean of Syria and Iraq. By the 3rd century during the Late Roman Period, the Nabateans stopped writing in Aramaic and began writing in [[Greek language|Greek]], and by the Byzantine Period they converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'' (London 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arabic, the area approximating the Byzantine Diocese of Palaestina I in the south (roughly Judea, Philistia, and southern Jordan) was called [[Jund Filastin]] (meaning &quot;the military district of Palestine&quot;, as a tax administrative area),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mideastweb.org/caliph2m.gif&lt;/ref&gt; and the Diocese of Palaestina II in the north (roughly Samaria, Galilee, Golan, and northern Jordan) [[Jund al-Urdunn]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 661, with the assassination of [[Ali]], the last of the Rashidun Caliphs, [[Muawiyah I]] became the uncontested Caliph of the Islamic World.

Trading relations between Palestine and Europe were strong, and a trade fair took place in Jerusalem every year on September 15 where merchants from [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]] and [[Marseilles]] converged to acquire spices, soaps, silks, olive oil, sugar and glassware in exchange for European products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp11&quot; /&gt;

In 744 riots broke out in the major cities of [[Palestine]] and [[Syria]] during the reign of [[Marwan II]], and were quelled in 745–6. These rebellions were followed by further revolts in the East of the empire, which culminated in the defeat of the [[Umayyad]] army in 750 at the [[Battle of the Zab]].

The influence of the Arabian tribes declined during the Abbasid period and the only context where they are reported is in uprising against the central authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil283&quot;&gt;Gil, Moshe (February 1997).

Harun al-Rashid viewed this as a rebellion and sent a large army under [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki]] to quell the revolt. According to historian Moshe Gil, &quot;he put down the rebels with an iron hand and much blood was spilled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil283&quot;/&gt; The cities of [[Gaza]], [[Bayt Jibrin]], [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] in Jund Filastin and the town Sariphaea in [[Jund al-Urdunn]] were completely destroyed in the conflict by [[Bedouin]] tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil283&quot;/&gt; Several towns and villages in western Palestine were also sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Exploration Fund, 1872, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The monasteries of St. Chariton, St. Cyriacus, St. Sabas, [[al-Ubeidiya|St. Theodosius]], and St. Euthymius were also attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrich65&quot;&gt;Patrich, 2001, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The combined casualties of the tribal federations totalled roughly 1,200.&lt;ref name=&quot;SERK22&quot;&gt;Shagrir, Ellenblum, Riley-Smith, and Kedar, 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 9th century, the Baghdad-based Abbasids began to lose control of their western provinces. From 878 Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], ruler of [[Egypt]] and founder of the [[Tulunid]] dynasty, who conquered Palestine and most of [[Syria]] four years after declaring [[Egypt]]'s independence from the [[Abbasid]] court in [[Baghdad]]. The [[Abbasids]] regained direct control of Palestine in 904, after their invasion forced the army of [[Tulunid]] Emir [[Harun of Tulunids|Harun]] to retreat to [[Egypt]] where the [[Tulunids]] were defeated the following year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Direct control from Baghdad was maintained until 939 when [[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]], governor of [[Abbasid]] [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine]], was granted independent control over his domain and the title Al-Ikhshid (Prince) by [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Ar-Radi]]. Like the Tulunids, the relative proximity of the Ikhshidid capital to Palestine resulted in a greater focus on the region, such that both Ikhshidid rulers, [[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]] and [[Abu al-Misk Kafur]], were buried in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The death of [[Abu al-Misk Kafur]] in 968 resulted in a fatal division of the [[Ikhshidid]] government as they prepared for the expected invasion by the [[Fatimids]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===[[Fatimid Caliphate]] period===
[[File:Fatimid Islamic Caliphate.png|thumb|left|The Fatimid Caliphate at its greatest extent, showing Jerusalem]]

From their base in [[Tunisia]], General [[Gawhar Al-Siqilli]] of the [[Ismaili]] [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]]s, who claimed to be descendants of Muhammad through his daughter [[Fatimah]], conquered the [[Ikhshidid]] domains of [[Palestine]] and [[Egypt]] in 969, following a treaty guaranteeing the local [[Sunni]]s freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=Arabnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt: The Fatimid Period 969 - 1771|publisher=Arab Net|year=2002|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.arab.net/egypt/et_fatimid.htm}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved their capital to the new city of [[Cairo]], just north of the [[Ikhshidid]] capital of [[Fustat]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Fatimids continued their expansion to the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and a failed attack on [[Antioch]] in 971 was followed up by a Byzantine defeat outside of [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Byzantines fought back and in 975 Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]]'s second campaign took Syria and much of northern Palestine, including [[Tiberias]], [[Nazareth]] and [[Caesarea Palaestina]], but was defeated en route to Jerusalem. The emperor became ill and died suddenly in 976 on his return from the campaign, and the Byzantines withdrew shortly thereafter to face the Bulgar threat in the north of their empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem, Nablus, and Askalan were expanded and renovated under Fatimid rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp11&quot; /&gt; However, in 1009, Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]] ordered the destruction of all churches and synagogues in the empire, including the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. However, this was reversed twenty years later by the Al-Hakim' successor as Caliph, [[Ali az-Zahir]], who authorized the rebuilding of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and other Christian churches in a treaty with Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos III Argyros]]. Romanos' successor [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] paid for the restoration, and a number of other Christian buildings, including the [[Muristan]] hospital, church and monastery were built during this period. Az-Zahir also undertook a major renovation of the [[Dome of the Rock]] during his reign. After the 10th century, the division of Palestine into ''Junds'' began to break down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahinp11&quot; /&gt;

During the early 11th century, [[Seljuk Turks]] invaded large portions of West Asia and both the [[Fatimid]]s and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] suffered setbacks from the fighting. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuks caused great disruption for the local population and for western pilgrims. In 1073 Palestine was captured by [[Malik-Shah I]]'s [[Isfahan]]-based [[Great Seljuq Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gil, ''A History of Palestine'' (Cambridge, 1992) p. 410; p. 411 n. 61&lt;/ref&gt; under Emir [[Atsiz ibn Uvaq]], who was advancing south into the weakening [[Fatimid Empire]] following the decisive defeat over the [[Byzantine]] army at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] two years previously and a devastating six-year famine in Egypt between 1067 and 1072.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh2002 p.455&quot;&gt;Singh, Nagendra. 2002. &quot;International Encyclopedia of Islamic Dynasties&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Seljuk rule was unpopular, and in 1077 Jerusalem revolted against their rule while Emir [[Atsiz ibd Uvaq]] was fighting the [[Fatimid Empire]] in [[Egypt]]. On his return to Jerusalem, Atsiz re-took the city and massacred the local population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth2007 p. 234&quot;&gt;Bosworth, Clifford Edmund. 2007. &quot;Historic Cities of the Islamic World''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Atsiz was executed by the governor of [[Syria]] [[Tutush I]], the brother of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] leader [[Malik-Shah I]]. [[Tutush I]] appointed [[Artuqid dynasty|Artuq bin Ekseb]], later founder of the [[Artuqid dynasty]], as governor. [[Artuqid dynasty|Artuq bin Ekseb]] died in 1091, and was succeeded as governor by his sons [[Ilghazi]] and [[Ahlatshahs|Sokmen]], known as the [[Artuqid dynasty]]. [[Malik-Shah I|Malik Shah]] died in 1092, and the [[Great Seljuk Empire]] split into smaller warring states. Control of Palestine was disputed between [[Duqaq]] and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] after the death of their father [[Tutush I]] in 1095. The ongoing rivalry weakens [[Syria]], and [[Fatimid]] Regent [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]] recaptured the region in 1098 from the [[Artuqids]], just before the arrival of the crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1054, the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] formally divided the Christian church into east and west, resulting in the holy sites of Palestine falling under the jurisdiction of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. However, in 1090, Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] began taking reconciliatory measures towards the [[Papacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before [[Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;II]] at the [[Council of Piacenza]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 279&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 279&lt;/ref&gt; to request [[mercenary]] forces, and later that year at the [[Council of Clermont]] Pope [[Urban II]] called for the [[First Crusade]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===[[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Kingdom of Jerusalem (Crusaders)]] period===
[[File:Near East 1135.svg|thumb|300px|The kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states at their height in 1135]]
[[File:The Byzantine Empire, c.1180.PNG|thumb|left|Crusader states shortly before their fall in 1180]]
{{Main|The Crusades}}

The [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] was a [[Christianity|Christian]] kingdom established in the [[Levant]] in 1099 as a result of the [[First Crusade]]. Its control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until defeat by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Shortly after Crusader rule was established in Palestine, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] promised to turn over the rule of the region to the Papacy once the crusaders had captured [[Egypt]]. However, the invasion of Egypt did not occur as Godfrey died shortly thereafter and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] was proclaimed the first [[King of Jerusalem]] after politically outmanoeuvering [[Dagobert of Pisa]] who had previously been appointed as the Latin Patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, Steven. 1951. ''A History of the Crusades: Volume 1 The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem''. New York, New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 279–290. ISBN 0-521-06161-X&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the kingdom was little more than a loose collection of towns and cities captured during the [[first crusade]]. At its height, the kingdom roughly encompassed the territory of modern-day Israel and the Palestinian territories. It extended from modern Lebanon in the north to the [[Sinai Desert]] in the south, and into modern Jordan and Syria in the east. There were also attempts to expand the kingdom into [[Fatimid]] Egypt. Its kings held a certain amount of authority over the other [[crusader state]]s to the north: the [[County of Tripoli]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], and the [[County of Edessa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Many customs and institutions were imported from the territories of Western Europe from which the crusaders came, and there were close familial and political connections with the West throughout the kingdom's existence. It was, however, a relatively minor kingdom in comparison and often lacked financial and military support from Europe. Locally based military orders were founded in the kingdom to fill this vacuum. The foundation of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] by [[Gerard Thom]] at the [[Muristan]] Christian hospice in Jerusalem was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] from [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1113, and the founding by [[Hugues de Payens]] and [[Godfrey de Saint-Omer]] of the [[Knights Templar]] took place in 1119 in the [[Al Aqsa Mosque]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The kingdom grew closer to the neighbouring [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], from which it inherited &quot;oriental&quot; qualities, and the kingdom was also influenced by pre-existing Muslim institutions. However, when [[Arnulf of Chocques]] was appointed [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] for the second time in 1112, he prohibited non-Catholic worship at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Socially, the &quot;Latin&quot; inhabitants from Western Europe had almost no contact with the Muslims and Eastern Christians whom they ruled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Royal Palace of the Kingdom was based in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], and the [[Dome of the Rock]] was converted in to a church. Under the Crusader rule, fortifications, castles, towers and fortified villages were built, rebuilt and renovated across Palestine largely in rural areas.&lt;ref name=Shahinp11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicolle&gt;{{cite book|title=Crusader Castles in the Holy Land 1192–1302|author=[[David Nicolle]]|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-1-84176-827-4|month=July | year=2005|url=http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php/title=S8278~per=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable urban remnant of the Crusader architecture of this era is found in Acre's old city&lt;ref name=Shahinp11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IsraelAntiquities&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects:The Old City of Akko (Acre)|publisher=Israeli Antiquities Authority|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?subject_id=11&amp;site_id=5&amp;id=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the island of [[Arwad]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the crusader defeat by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187, most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. However a rump crusader state in the northern coastal cities known as the [[Kingdom of Acre]] survived in the region for another hundred years until 1291, throughout the Ayyubid Period and well into the Mamluk Period. However, despite seven further crusades from Europe, the Crusader state was no longer a significant power in the region after the fall of Jerusalem in 1187.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Ayyubids allowed Jewish and [[Orthodox Christian]] settlement in the region, and the [[Dome of the Rock]] was converted back in to an [[Islamic]] center of worship. The [[Mosque of Omar (Jerusalem)|Mosque of Omar]] was built under [[Saladin]] outside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], commemorating [[Umar]] the Great's decision to pray outside the church so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the Church's status as a Christian site. About eighty years after Saladin's conquest, the Catalan Rabbi [[Nahmanides]] left Europe following the [[disputation of Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 73 in Jonathan Sachs (2005) To heal a fractured world: the ethics of responsibility. London: Continuum (ISBN 978-0-8264-8039-2)&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the last three years of his life in Palestine, primarily in Acre. He established the [[Ramban Synagogue]] in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] and thus, having found only two Jewish people living in the city at the time, re-established Jewish communal life in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The defeat of the Europeans provoked further crusades from Europe, varying in size and success. In 1192, after preventing the [[Third Crusade]] under [[Richard the Lionheart]] from recapturing Jerusalem, Saladin entered into the [[Treaty of Ramla]] in which he agreed that Western [[Christian]] pilgrims could worship freely in [[Jerusalem]]. The threat remained, however, and [[Ayyubid]] Emir [[Al-Mu'azzam]] destroyed Jerusalem's city walls in 1219 to prevent the [[Crusaders]] from capturing a fortified city. To end the [[Sixth Crusade]], a 10-year treaty was signed between [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Ayyubid]] [[Sultan]] [[Al-Kamil]], allowing Christians freedom to live in the unfortified Jerusalem, as well as [[Nazareth]] and Bethlehem, although the [[Ayyubids]] retained control of the [[Muslim]] holy places.&lt;ref name=Setton/&gt;

These areas were returned to Ayyubid control after the peace treaty expired in 1239 and [[An-Nasir Dawud]], [[Ayyubid]] Emir of [[Kerak]], occupied the cities. For the four following years, control of the cities was contested between [[An-Nasir Dawud]] and his cousin [[As-Salih Ayyub]] who had allied with the [[Crusaders]], aided by the diplomatic efforts of [[Thibaut IV of Champagne]]. In order to permanently retake the city from the rival breakaway rulers who had allied with the [[Crusaders]], [[As-Salih Ayyub]] summoned a huge mercenary army of [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty#Mercenaries|Khwarezmians]], who were available for hire following the defeat of the [[Khwarazm Shah]] dynasty by the Mongols ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08364a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (After 1291) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty#Mercenaries|Khwarezmians]] could not be controlled by As-Salih Ayyub, and destroyed Jerusalem.

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was indirectly created in [[Egypt]] as a result of the [[Seventh Crusade]], which had been launched in reaction to the 1244 destruction of Jerusalem. The crusade failed after [[Louis IX of France]] was defeated and captured by [[Ayyubid]] [[Sultan]] [[Turanshah]] at the [[Battle of Fariskur]] in 1250. [[Turanshah]] was killed by his [[Mamluk]] soldiers a month after the battle and his step-mother [[Shajar al-Durr]] became [[Sultana (title)|Sultana]] of [[Egypt]] with the [[Mamluk]] [[Aybak]] as [[Atabeg]]. The [[Ayyubids]] relocated to [[Damascus]], where they continued to control Palestine for a further 10 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the late 13th century, Palestine and Syria became the primary front against the fast-expanding [[Mongol Empire]]. The Army of the [[Mongol Empire]] reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the [[Mongol raids into Palestine]] under [[Nestorian Christian]] general [[Kitbuqa]]. Mongol leader [[Hulagu Khan]] sent a message to [[Louis IX of France]] that Jerusalem had been remitted to the [[Christians]] under the [[Franco-Mongol Alliance]], however shortly thereafter he had to return to Mongolia following the death of [[Möngke Khan|Mongke]], leaving [[Kitbuqa]] and a reduced army. Kitbuqa then engaged with the Mamluks under [[Baibars]] in the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The Mamluks' decisive victory in Palestine is seen as one of [[world history]]'s most significant battles, establishing a highwater mark for the Mongol conquests. The Mongols were, however, able to engage into some further brief [[Mongol raids into Palestine]] in 1300 under [[Ghazan]] and [[Mulay]], reaching as far as Gaza. [[Jerusalem]] was held by the Mongols for four months (see [[Ninth Crusade]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1270, Sultan [[Baibars]] expelled the remaining Crusaders from most of the country, and the last major Crusader stronghold, [[Acre, Palestine|Acre]] fell in 1291, at the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Siege of Acre]].&lt;ref name=Setton/&gt; Thereafter, any remaining Europeans either went home or merged with the local population.&lt;ref name=Shahinp12 /&gt;

The Mamluks, continuing the policy of the [[Ayyubids]], made the strategic decision to destroy the coastal area and to bring desolation to many of its cities, from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in the north to Gaza in the south. [[sea port|Ports]] were destroyed and various materials were dumped to make them inoperable. The goal was to prevent attacks from the sea, given the fear of the return of the crusaders. This had a long term affect on those areas, that remained sparsely populated for centuries. The activity in that time concentrated more inland.&lt;ref&gt;Myriam Rosen-Ayalon, ``Between Cairo and Damascus: Rural Life and Urban Economics in the Holy Land During the Ayyuid, Maluk and Ottoman Periods'' in '''The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land'' edited Thomas Evan Levy, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestine formed a part of the [[Damascus]] [[Wilayah]] (district) under the rule of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt and was divided into three smaller [[Sanjak]]s (subdivisions) with capitals in [[Jerusalem#Crusader, Ayyubid, and Mamluk period|Jerusalem]], Gaza, and Safed.&lt;ref name=Shahinp12 /&gt; Due in part to the many conflicts, earthquakes and the [[Black Death]] that hit the region during this era, the population is estimated to have dwindled to around 200,000. The Mamluks constructed a &quot;postal road&quot; from [[Cairo]] to [[Damascus]], that included lodgings for travelers ([[Caravanserai|khans]]) and bridges, some of which survive to this day ([[Wikipedia:WikiProject Palestine/Jisr Jindas|Jisr Jindas]], near [[Lod]]). The period also saw the construction of many schools and the renovation of mosques neglected or destroyed during the Crusader period.&lt;ref name=WKhalidi28 /&gt;

In 1377 the major cities of Palestine and [[Syria]] revolted, following the death of [[Al-Ashraf Sha'ban]]. The revolt was quelled and a [[coup d'etat]] was staged by [[Barquq]] in [[Cairo]] in 1382, founding the [[Mamluk]] [[Burji dynasty]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Palestine was celebrated by Arab and Muslim writers of the time as the &quot;blessed land of the prophets and Islam's revered leaders&quot;,&lt;ref name=Shahinp12 /&gt; Muslim sanctuaries were &quot;rediscovered&quot; and received many pilgrims.&lt;ref name=WKhalidi28&gt;{{cite book|title=Before Their Diaspora|author=Walid Khalidi|publisher=Institute for Palestine Studies, Washington DC|year=1984|pages=28–29|isbn=0-88728-144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1496, [[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi]] wrote his history of Palestine known as ''The Glorious History of Jerusalem and Hebron&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a battle for control over western Asia. The Mamluk armies were eventually defeated by the forces of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Selim I]], and lost control of Palestine after the 1516 battle of [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|Marj Dabiq]].&lt;ref name=Shahinp12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase, 2003, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The Founder of Modern Egypt - A Study of Muhammad 'Ali by Henry Dodwell Palmerston and the Levant Crisis, 1832 M. Vereté The Journal of Modern History &gt; Vol. 24, No. 2 (Jun. 1952), pp. 143–151 --&gt;
On 10 May 1832 the territories of [[Bilad ash-Sham]], which include modern Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel were conquered and annexed by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s expansionist Egypt (nominally still Ottoman) in the [[1831 Egyptian-Ottoman War]]. Britain sent the navy to shell Beirut and an Anglo-Ottoman expeditionary force landed, causing local uprisings against the Egyptian occupiers. A British naval squadron anchored off Alexandria. The Egyptian army retreated to Egypt. Muhammad Ali signed the Treaty of 1841. Britain returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans, and as a result was able to increase the extraterritorial rights that various European nations has enjoyed throughout previous centuries under the terms of the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. One American diplomat wrote that &quot;Extraordinary privileges and immunities had become so embodied in successive treaties between the great Christian Powers and the Sublime Porte that for most intents and purposes many nationalities in the Ottoman empire formed a state within the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire and the Question of their Abrogation as it Affects the United States, Lucius Ellsworth Thayer, The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 17, No. 2 (April , 1923), pp. 207-233 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2188106]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, there was a [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|peasants revolt]] against conscription into the Egyptian army. Local pre-Zionist indigenous Jews of the [[Old Yishuv]] were massacred when they became targets of the general Arab Muslim and Druze discontent during the [[Safed Plunder]].

In common usage from 1840 onwards, &quot;Palestine&quot; was used either to describe the Consular jurisdictions of the Western Powers&lt;ref&gt;e.g. American Consuls in the Holy Land, 1832–1914 By Ruth Kark, Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1994, ISBN 0-8143-2523-8, p. 139 [http://books.google.com/books?id=LkAvPDl5yfgC&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;client=&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; or for a region that extended in the north-south direction typically from [[Rafah]] (south-east of [[Gaza]]) to the [[Litani River]] (now in Lebanon). The western boundary was the sea, and the eastern boundary was the poorly-defined place where the Syrian desert began. In various European sources, the eastern boundary was placed anywhere from the Jordan River to slightly east of [[Amman]]. The [[Negev Desert]] was not included.&lt;ref&gt;Biger, Gideon (1981). Where was Palestine? Pre-World War I perception, AREA (Journal of the Institute of British Geographers) Vol 13, No. 2, pp. 153–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Consuls were originally magistrates who tried cases involving their own citizens in foreign territories. While the jurisdictions in the secular states of Europe had become territorial, the Ottomans perpetuated the legal system they inherited from the Byzantine Empire. The law in many matters was personal, not territorial, and the individual citizen carried his nation's law with him wherever he went.&lt;ref&gt;The Abrogation of the Turkish Capitulations, Norman Bentwich, Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, Third Series, Vol. 5, No. 4 (1923), pp. 182–188 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/752966]&lt;/ref&gt; Capitulatory law applied to foreigners in Palestine. Only Consular Courts of the State of the foreigners concerned were competent to try them. That was true, not only in cases involving personal status, but also in criminal and commercial matters.&lt;ref&gt;From Occupation to Interim Accords, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Moslem, Christian, and Jewish communities of Palestine were allowed to exercise jurisdiction over their own members according to charters granted to them. For centuries the Jews and Christians had enjoyed a large degree of communal autonomy in matters of worship, jurisdiction over personal status, taxes, and in managing their schools and charitable institutions. In the 19th century those rights were formally recognized as part of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms and when the communities were placed under the protection of European public law.&lt;ref&gt;See Jews, Turks, Ottomans, Avigdor Levy (Editor) Syracuse University Press, 2003, ISBN 0-8156-2941-9, p. 109; Christian communities in Jerusalem and the West Bank since 1948, By Daphne Tsimhoni, Praeger, 1993, ISBN 0-275-93921-9, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See International law: achievements and prospects, UNESCO, editor Mohammed Bedjaoui, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991, ISBN 92-3-102716-6, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s the Ottoman military was able to restore order east of Jordan by halting tribal conflicts and bedouin raids. This invited migration to the east, notably the [[Salt, Jordan|es-Salt]] area, from various populations in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine to take advantage of new lands. This influx amounted to some 12,000 over the period from 1880 to just before the First World War, while the Bedouin population east of Jordan increased to 56,000.&lt;ref&gt;Heikki Palva, Negations in the dialect of [[Salt, Jordan|''es-Salt'']], Jordan, university of Helsinki, in, Martine Haak, Rudolf de Jong, Kees Versteegh, eds., ''Approaches to Arabic dialects: A collection of articles presented to Manfred Woidich on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday'', Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 2004, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the creation of the Transjordanian emirate in 1921–22, the hamlet of [[Amman|''ʿAmmān'']], which had been recently resettled by Circassians, attracted most of the new immigrants from Palestine, and many of those that had previously moved to es-Salt.&lt;ref&gt;Heikki Palva, Negations in the dialect of [[Salt, Jordan|''es-Salt'']], Jordan, university of Helsinki, in, Martine Haak, Rudolf de Jong, Kees Versteegh, eds., ''Approaches to Arabic dialects: A collection of articles presented to Manfred Woidich on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday'', Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 2004, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reorganisation of 1873, which established the administrative boundaries that remained in place until 1914, Palestine was split between three major administrative units. The northern part, above a line connecting Jaffa to north Jericho and the Jordan, was assigned to the [[vilayet of Beirut]], subdivided into the ''[[sanjak]]s'' (districts) of [[Sanjak of Acre|Acre]], Beirut and [[Sanjak of Nablus|Nablus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boundaries&quot;/&gt; The southern part, from Jaffa downwards, was part of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], a special district under the direct authority of [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James P.|last=Jankowski|title=Rethinking Nationalism in the Arab Middle East|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f3axNF2GdCkC&amp;dq=Jerusalem+1874+Ottoman&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1997|page=174|isbn=0231106955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its southern boundaries were unclear but petered out in the eastern Sinai Peninsula and northern Negev Desert.

The Ottomans regarded &quot;Filistin&quot; as an abstract term referring to the &quot;Holy Land&quot;, and not one consistently applied to a clearly defined area.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, &quot;Palestine: On the History and Geography of a Name&quot;, ''International History Review'' 11 (1980): 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the educated Arab public, ''Filastin'' was a common concept, referring either to the whole of Palestine or to the Jerusalem ''sanjak'' alone&lt;ref&gt;Porath, 1974, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; or just to the area around Ramle.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gerber (1998) referring to [[fatwa]]s by two [[Hanafite]] Syrian jurists.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the daily paper ''Falastin'' (Palestine) from 1911 was one example of the increasing currency of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, John (2010), pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Zionism]], the national movement of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] started in Europe in the 19th century seeking to recreate a Jewish state in Palestine, and return the original homeland of the Jewish people.

The Second Aliyah immigrants were primarily idealists, inspired by the revolutionary ideals then sweeping the [[Russian Empire]] who sought to create a communal agricultural settlement system in Palestine. They thus founded the [[kibbutz]] movement. The first kibbutz, [[Degania Alef|Degania]], was founded in 1909.

In [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] sided with [[Germany]]. As a result, it was embroiled in a conflict with [[Great Britain]]. Under the secret [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916, it was envisioned that most of Palestine, when freed from Ottoman control, would become an international zone not under direct French or British colonial control. Shortly thereafter, British foreign minister [[Arthur Balfour]] issued the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], which promised to establish a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; in Palestine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6T_Ff6Ra57sC&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Baylis Thomas,'&amp;#39;How Israel was Won'&amp;#39; (1999) p. 19 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24|isbn=978-0-7391-0064-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; but appeared to contradict the 1915–16 [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]], which contained an undertaking to form an Arab state in exchange for the Great [[Arab Revolt]]. McMahon's promises could have been seen by Arab nationalists as a pledge of immediate Arab independence, an undertaking violated by the region's subsequent partition into British and French [[League of Nations mandate]]s under the secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] of May 1916, which became the real cornerstone of the [[geopolitics]] structuring the entire region. The Balfour Declaration, likewise, was seen by Jewish nationalists as the cornerstone of a future Jewish homeland.

The British-led [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], commanded by [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]], captured Jerusalem on 9 December 1917 and occupied the whole of the Levant following the defeat of Turkish forces in Palestine at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918 and the capitulation of Turkey on 31 October.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 1999, p. 17; p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Third Battle of Gaza]] and [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]]&lt;/ref&gt; Allenby famously dismounted from his horse when he entered Jerusalem as a mark of respect for the ''Holy City'' and was greeted by the [[Christian]], [[Jewish]], and [[Islamic]] leaders of the city.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the First World War and the occupation of the region by the British, the principal [[Allied Powers|Allied and associated powers]] drafted the mandate, which was formally approved by the [[League of Nations]] in 1922. Great Britain administered Palestine on behalf of the League of Nations between 1920 and 1948, a period referred to as the &quot;British Mandate&quot;. Two states were established within the boundaries of the Mandate territory, Palestine and Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;Boundaries Delimitation: Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Yitzhak Gil-Har, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1 (January , 2000), pp. 68-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, U.S. State Department (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp. 650–652&lt;/ref&gt;

The preamble of the mandate declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|declaration originally made on November 2nd, 1917]], by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp |title=The Palestine Mandate |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all were satisfied with the mandate. The purported objective of the League of Nations mandate system was to administer parts of the defunct Ottoman Empire, which had been in control of the [[Middle East]] since the 16th century, &quot;until such time as they are able to stand alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm#art22 Article 22, The Covenant of the League of Nations] and &quot;Mandate for Palestine&quot;, Encyclopedia Judaica, Vol. 11, p. 862, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Arabs]] felt that Britain was violating the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]] and the understanding of the [[Arab Revolt]]. Some wanted a unification with Syria:
In February 1919, several Moslem and Christian groups from Jaffa and Jerusalem met and adopted a platform endorsing unity with Syria and opposition to Zionism (this is sometimes called the First Palestinian National Congress). A letter was sent to Damascus authorizing [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] to represent the Arabs of Palestine at the Paris Peace Conference. In May 1919 a [[Syrian National Congress]] was held in Damascus, and a Palestinian delegation attended its sessions.&lt;ref&gt;see A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, By Mark A. Tessler, Indiana University Press, 1994, ISBN 0-253-20873-4, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1922 census of Palestine]] recorded the population of Palestine as 757,000, of which 78% were Muslims, 11% were Jews, 10% were Christians and 1% were Druze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census1922&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor=J. B. Barron | title=Palestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922 | publisher=Government of Palestine | year=1923 | at=Table I}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the Mandate, Jewish immigration to Palestine was quite substantial. In April 1920, violent Arab disturbances against the Jews in Jerusalem occurred, which came to be known as the [[1920 Palestine riots]]. The riots followed rising tensions in Arab-Jewish relations over the implications of Zionist immigration. The British military administration's erratic response failed to contain the rioting, which continued for four days. As a result of the events, trust among the British, Jews, and Arabs eroded. One consequence was that the Jewish community increased moves towards an autonomous infrastructure and security apparatus parallel to that of the British administration.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In April 1920, the Allied Supreme Council (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) met at [[San Remo conference|Sanremo]] and formal decisions were taken on the allocation of mandate territories. The United Kingdom obtained a mandate for Palestine and France obtained a mandate for Syria. The boundaries of the mandates and the conditions under which they were to be held were not decided. The Zionist Organization's representative at Sanremo, [[Chaim Weizmann]], subsequently reported to his colleagues in London:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are still important details outstanding, such as the actual terms of the mandate and the question of the boundaries in Palestine. There is the [[delimitation]] of the boundary between French Syria and Palestine, which will constitute the northern frontier and the eastern line of demarcation, adjoining Arab Syria. The latter is not likely to be fixed until the Emir Feisal attends the Peace Conference, probably in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;'Zionist Aspirations: Dr Weizmann on the Future of Palestine', ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 May 1920; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Churchillabdullah.jpg|thumb|Churchill and Abdullah (with Herbert Samuel) during their negotiations in Jerusalem, March 1921]]

In July 1920, the French drove [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal bin Husayn]] from Damascus, ending his already negligible control over the region of Transjordan, where local chiefs traditionally resisted any central authority. The sheikhs, who had earlier pledged their loyalty to the [[Sharif of Mecca]], asked the British to undertake the region's administration. [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] asked for the extension of the Palestine government's authority to Transjordan, but at meetings in Cairo and Jerusalem between [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Emir Abdullah]] in March 1921 it was agreed that Abdullah would administer the territory (initially for six months only) on behalf of the Palestine administration. In the summer of 1921 Transjordan was included within the Mandate, but excluded from the provisions for a [[Jewish National Home]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, 1997, pp. 6–15.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 1922, the League of Nations approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine and Transjordan. On 16 September the League formally [[Transjordan memorandum|approved a memorandum]] from [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]] confirming the exemption of Transjordan from the clauses of the mandate concerning the creation of a Jewish national home and Jewish settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, 1999, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; With Transjordan coming under the administration of the British Mandate, the mandate's collective territory became constituted of 23% Palestine and 77% Transjordan. The mandate for Palestine, while specifying actions in support of Jewish immigration and political status, stated, in Article 25, that in the territory to the east of the Jordan River, Britain could 'postpone or withhold' those articles of the Mandate concerning a Jewish National Home. Transjordan was a very sparsely populated region (especially in comparison with Palestine proper) due to its relatively limited resources and largely desert environment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
[[File:BritishMandatePalestine1920.svg|thumb|right|Palestine and [[Transjordan]] were incorporated (under different legal and administrative arrangements) into the Mandate for Palestine issued by the [[League of Nations]] to [[Great Britain]] on 29 September 1923]]

In 1923, an agreement between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] confirmed the border between the British Mandate of Palestine and the [[French Mandate of Syria]]. The British handed over the southern [[Golan Heights]] to the French in return for the northern Jordan Valley. The border was re-drawn so that both sides of the [[Jordan River]] and the whole of the [[Sea of Galilee]], including a 10-metre-wide strip along the northeastern shore, were made a part of Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caabu.org/press/focus/gee.html |title=The Council for Arab-British Understanding |publisher=CAABU |date= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the provisions that Syria have fishing and navigation rights in the lake.&lt;ref&gt;No. 565. — Exchange of Notes * Constituting an Agreement Between the British and French Governments Respecting the Boundary Line Between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hammé, Paris March 7, 1923, p. 7 [http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf Border Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the Mandate came into legal effect in 1923 ([[1922 Text: League of Nations Palestine Mandate|text]]), British terminology sometimes used '&quot;Palestine&quot; for the part west of the Jordan River and &quot;Trans-Jordan&quot; (or ''Transjordania'') for the part east of the Jordan River.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrams, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==== Infrastructure and development ====
Between 1922 and 1947, the annual growth rate of the Jewish sector of the economy was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5%. Per capita, these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively. By 1936, the Jewish sector had eclipsed the Arab one, and Jewish individuals earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs. In terms of human capital, there was a huge difference. For instance, the literacy rates in 1932 were 86% for the Jews against 22% for the Arabs, but Arab literacy was steadily increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, ''The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood'', 2006. Beacon Press. [http://books.google.com/books?id=xp3MQavDxjIC].&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of &quot;Mufti of Jerusalem&quot;, traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned by the British into that of &quot;Grand Mufti of Palestine&quot;. Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties, such as the administration of religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis. During the revolt (see below) the [[Arab Higher Committee]] was established as the central political organ of the Arab community of Palestine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

During the Mandate period, many factories were established and roads and railroads were built throughout the country. The Jordan River was harnessed for production of electric power and the Dead Sea was tapped for minerals—[[potash]] and [[bromine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==== 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine ====
{{Main|1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine}}

Sparked off by the death of [[Sheikh|Shaykh]] [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] at the hands of the British police near [[Jenin]] in November 1935, in the years 1936–1939 the Arabs participated in the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Uprising]] to protest against British rule and against mass Jewish immigration. The revolt manifested in a [[Palestinian general strike|strike]] and armed insurrection started sporadically, becoming more organized with time. Attacks were mainly directed at British strategic installations such as the [[Trans Arabian Pipeline]] (TAP) and railways, and to a lesser extent against Jewish settlements, secluded Jewish neighborhoods in the mixed cities, and Jews, both individually and in groups.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Violence abated for about a year while the [[Peel Commission]] deliberated and eventually recommended partition of Palestine. With the rejection of this proposal, the revolt resumed during the autumn of 1937. Violence continued throughout 1938 and eventually petered out in 1939.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The British responded to the violence by greatly expanding their military forces and clamping down on Arab dissent. &quot;Administrative detention&quot; (imprisonment without charges or trial), curfews, and house demolitions were among British practices during this period. More than 120 Arabs were sentenced to death and about 40 hanged. The main Arab leaders were arrested or expelled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The ''[[Haganah]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for &quot;defense&quot;), an illegal Jewish paramilitary organization, actively supported British efforts to quell the insurgency, which reached 10,000 Arab fighters at their peak during the summer and fall of 1938. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the ''Haganah'', the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the [[Jewish Settlement Police]] and [[Special Night Squads]].&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historama.com/online-resources/online-gallery/eretz_israel_palestine_noter_jewish_settlement_police_uniform.html see Uniform and History of the Palestine Police]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[terrorist]] splinter group of the Haganah, called the ''[[Irgun]]'' (or ''Etzel'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac02.htm Etzel - The Establishment of Irgun].&lt;/ref&gt; adopted a policy of violent retaliation against Arabs for attacks on Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac03.htm |title=Restraint and Retaliation |publisher=Etzel |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting in Alexandria in July 1937 between Jabotinsky and Irgun commander Col. Robert Bitker and chief-of-staff Moshe Rosenberg, the need for indiscriminate retaliation due to the difficulty of limiting operations to only the &quot;guilty&quot; was explained. The Irgun launched attacks against public gathering places such as markets and cafes.&lt;ref&gt;see for example the incident on 14 March 1937 when Arieh Yitzhaki and Benjamin Zeroni tossed a bomb into the Azur coffee house outside Tel Aviv in Terror Out of Zion, by J. Bowyer Bell, Transaction Publishers, , 1996, ISBN 1-56000-870-9, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Havlagah bus during 1936-1939 Arab revolt-British Mandate of Palestine.jpg|thumb|The Arab revolt of 1936–39 in Palestine.

The revolt did not achieve its goals, although it is &quot;credited with signifying the birth of the Arab Palestinian identity&quot;.&lt;ref name=HistoryOfPalestinianRevolts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9A489B74-6477-4E67-9C22-0F53A3CC9ADF.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051215061527/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9A489B74-6477-4E67-9C22-0F53A3CC9ADF.htm |archivedate=2005-12-15 |title=Aljazeera: The history of Palestinian revolts |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally credited with forcing the issuance of the [[White Paper of 1939]], which renounced Britain's intent of creating a Jewish National Home in Palestine, as proclaimed in the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Another outcome of the hostilities was the partial disengagement of the Jewish and Arab economies in Palestine, which were more or less intertwined until that time. For example, whereas the Jewish city of [[Tel Aviv]] previously relied on the nearby Arab seaport of [[Jaffa]], hostilities dictated the construction of a separate Jewish-run seaport for Tel Aviv.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==== World War II and Palestine ====
When the Second World War broke out, the Jewish population sided with Britain. [[David Ben-Gurion]], head of the [[Jewish Agency]], defined the policy with what became a famous motto: &quot;We will fight the war as if there were no White Paper, and we will fight the White Paper as if there were no war.&quot; While this represented the Jewish population as a whole, there were exceptions (see below).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

As in most of the Arab world, there was no unanimity among the Palestinian Arabs as to their position regarding the combatants in World War II. A number of leaders and public figures saw an [[Axis powers|Axis]] victory as the likely outcome and a way of securing Palestine back from the Zionists and the British. [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, spent the rest of the war in [[Nazi Germany]] and the occupied areas. About 6,000 Palestinian Arabs and 30,000 Palestinian Jews joined the British forces.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the British Commonwealth and sided with Germany. Within a month, the Italians [[Italian bombings on Palestine in World War II|attacked Palestine from the air]], bombing [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?ID=470&amp;t=Why-Italian-Planes-Bombed-Tel-Aviv |title=Why Italian Planes Bombed Tel-Aviv? |publisher=Isracast.com |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, there was a period of anxiety for the [[Yishuv]], when the forces of German General [[Erwin Rommel]] advanced east in [[North Africa]] towards the [[Suez Canal]] and there was fear that they would conquer Palestine. This period was referred to as the [[200 days of anxiety|two hundred days of anxiety]]. This event was the direct cause for the founding, with British support, of the [[Palmach]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycentral.com/Israel/1941PalmachFormed.html How the Palmach was formed] (History Central)&lt;/ref&gt;—a highly-trained regular unit belonging to [[Haganah]] (which was mostly made up of reserve troops).
[[File:JB HQ.jpg|thumb|Jewish Brigade headquarters under both [[Union Flag]] and [[Flag of Israel|Jewish flag]]]]
On 3 July 1944, the British government consented to the establishment of a [[Jewish Brigade]] with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers. The brigade fought in Europe, most notably against the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in [[Italy]] from March 1945 until the end of the war in May 1945. Members of the Brigade played a key role in the [[Berihah]]'s efforts to help Jews escape Europe for Palestine. Later, veterans of the Jewish Brigade became key participants of the new [[State of Israel]]'s [[Israel Defense Force]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Starting in 1939 and throughout the war and the [[Holocaust]], the British reduced the number of Jewish immigrants allowed into Palestine, following the publication of the [[MacDonald White Paper]]. Once the 15,000 annual quota was exceeded, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution were placed in detention camps or deported to places such as [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Lenk, ''The Mauritius Affair, The Boat People of 1940/41'', London 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 [[Menachem Begin]] assumed the [[Irgun]]'s leadership, determined to force the British government to remove its troops entirely from Palestine. Citing that the British had reneged on their original promise of the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]], and that the [[White Paper of 1939]] restricting Jewish immigration was an escalation of their pro-Arab policy, he decided to break with the Haganah. Soon after he assumed command, a formal 'Declaration of Revolt' was publicized, and armed attacks against British forces were initiated. [[LEHI|Lehi]], another splinter group, opposed cessation of operations against the British authorities all along. The [[Jewish Agency]], which opposed those actions and the challenge to its role as government in preparation responded with &quot;[[The Hunting Season]]&quot;—severe actions against supporters of the Irgun and Lehi, including turning them over to the British.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The country developed economically during the war, with increased industrial and agricultural outputs and the period was considered an `economic Boom'. In terms of Arab-Jewish relations, these were relatively quiet times.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Gelvin, '''The Israel-Palestine conflict''', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombe Irgoun 29 dec 1947.jpg|thumb|Arab autobus after an attack by [[Irgun]], 29 December 1947]]
In the years following [[World War II]], Britain's control over Palestine became increasingly tenuous. This was caused by a combination of factors, including:
* World public opinion turned against Britain as a result of the British policy of preventing [[Holocaust]] survivors from reaching Palestine, sending them instead to [[Cyprus internment camps]], or even back to [[Germany]], as in the case of [[Exodus (ship)|Exodus 1947]].
* The costs of maintaining an army of over 100,000 men in Palestine weighed heavily on a British economy suffering from post-war depression, and was another cause for British public opinion to demand an end to the Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;The Rise and fall of the British Empire, By Lawrence James, Macmillan, 1997, ISBN 0-312-16985-X, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rapid deterioration due to the actions of the Jewish paramilitary organizations ([[Hagana]], [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]), involving attacks on strategic installations (by all three) as well as on British forces and officials (by the Irgun and Lehi). This caused severe damage to British morale and prestige, as well as increasing opposition to the mandate in Britain itself, public opinion demanding to &quot;bring the boys home&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* The U.S. Congress was delaying a loan necessary to prevent British bankruptcy. The delays were in response to the British refusal to fulfill a promise given to Truman that 100,000 Holocaust survivors would be allowed to emigrate to Palestine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In early 1947 the British Government announced their desire to terminate the Mandate, and asked the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to make recommendations regarding the future of the country.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ukreq.html Request for a Special Session of the General Assembly on Palestine]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Administration declined to accept the responsibility for implementing any solution that wasn't acceptable to both the Jewish and the Arab communities, or to allow other authorities to take over responsibility for public security prior to the termination of its mandate on 15 May 1948.&lt;ref&gt;see Rabbi Silver's request regarding the formation of a Jewish militia and the dissolution of the mandate in S/PV.262, Minutes 262nd Meeting of the UN Security Council,5 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intensive battles were waged between the Jordanian and Israeli forces over the control of Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On June 11, a truce was accepted by all parties. Israel used the lull to undertake a large-scale reinforcement of its army. In a series of military operations, it then conquered the whole of the Galilee region, both the Lydda and Ramle areas, and the Negev. It also managed to secure, in the [[Battles of Latrun]], a road linking Jerusalem to Israel. In this phase, 350,000 more Arab Palestinians fled or were expelled from the conquered areas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Partition between Israel, Jordan and Egypt===
{{Main|History of the State of Israel|Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt}}

During the first 6 months of 1949, negotiations between the belligerents came to terms over armistice lines that delimited Israel's borders. On the other side, no Palestinian Arab state was founded: Jordan annexed the Arab territories of the Mandatory regions of Samaria and Judea (today known as the [[West Bank]]), as well as East Jerusalem, while the Gaza strip came under Egyptian administration. During this time, Jordan and Egypt did not normalize the living conditions for the Palestinian refugees, neither did Israel after 1967. All Jewish inhabitants were expelled from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip until the Israel occupation in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The [[New Historians]], like [[Avi Shlaim]], hold that there was an unwritten secret agreement between King Abdullah of Transjordan and Israeli authorities to partition the territory between themselves, and that this translated into each side limiting their objectives and exercising mutual restraint during the 1948 war.&lt;ref name=Shlaimp187&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=0nUqCwLOW-sC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=%22king+abdullah%22+jordan+agreement+secret#v=onepage&amp;q=%22king%20abdullah%22%20jordan%20agreement%20secret&amp;f=false Avi Shlaim in Pappe's The Israel/Palestine question], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day that the [[State of Israel]] was announced, the Arab League announced that it would set up a single Arab civil administration throughout Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JAW2aHnkL4UC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq= |title=Truman, the Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel, John Snetsinger, Hoover Press, 1974, ISBN 0-8179-3391-3, p. 107 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24|isbn=978-0-8179-3391-3|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see The Middle East Journal, Middle East Institute (Washington, D.C.), 1949, p. 78, October 1): Robert A.

The former mufti of Jerusalem, [[Amin al-Husayni|Haj Amin al-Husseini]], was appointed as president. The government was recognised by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Yemen]], but not by Transjordan (later known as [[Jordan]]) or any non-Arab country. It was little more than an Egyptian protectorate and had negligible influence or funding. Palestinian Arabs living in the [[Gaza Strip]] or Egypt were issued with All-Palestine passports until 1959, when [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], president of Egypt, issued a decree that annulled the All-Palestine government.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the area allocated to the Palestinian Arabs and the international zone of Jerusalem were occupied by Israel and the neighboring Arab states in accordance with the terms of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. In addition to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN-partitioned area]] allotted to the Jewish state, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Jordan [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|captured and annexed about 21% of the Mandate territory]], which it referred to as the [[West Bank]] (to differentiate it from the newly-named [[East Bank]] – the original Transjordan). Jerusalem was divided, with Jordan taking the eastern parts, including the [[Jerusalem's Old City walls|Old City]], and Israel taking the western parts. The [[Gaza Strip]] was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|captured by Egypt]]. In addition, Syria held on to small slivers of Mandate territory to the south and east of the [[Sea of Galilee]], which had been allocated in the UN partition plan to the Jewish state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} For a description of the massive population movements, Arab and Jewish, at the time of the 1948 war and over the following decades, see [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] and [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Israeli period===
{{Over coverage|region=the West Bank and Gaza Strip|date=October 2012}}
====Six Day War and Yom Kippur War====
[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|thumb|left|The region as of today: [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[Golan Heights]]]]

In the course of the [[Six Day War]] in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine, taking West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Following military threats by Egypt and Syria, including Egyptian president Nasser's demand of the UN to remove its peace-keeping troops from the Egyptian-Israeli border, in June 1967 Israeli forces went to action against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. As a result of that war, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] conquered the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] bringing them under [[Military law|military rule]]. Israel also pushed Arab forces back from East Jerusalem, which Jews had not been permitted to visit during the prior Jordanian rule. East Jerusalem was allegedly&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Lustick]], [http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol5/9701_lustick.asp Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem?]&lt;/ref&gt; annexed by Israel as part of its capital, though this action has not been recognized internationally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Israel also started building [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] on the occupied land.&lt;ref&gt;Ian J. Bickerton 2009, ''The Arab-Israeli-Conflict: A History''. Reaktion Books Ltd, ISBN 9781861895271, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nation's [[Security Council]] passed [[Resolution 242]], promoting the &quot;[[land for peace]]&quot; formula, which called for Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967, in return for the end of all states of belligerency by the aforementioned [[Arab League]] nations. Palestinians continued longstanding demands for the destruction of Israel or made a new demand for self-determination in a separate independent Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip similar to but smaller than the original Partition area that Palestinians and the Arab League had rejected for statehood in 1947.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the course of 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], military forces of Egypt crossed the Suez canal and Syria to regain the Golan heights. The attacking military forces of Syria were pushed back. After a cease fire, Egyptian President Sadat [[Anwar Sadat]] started peace talks with the U.S. and Israel. Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to [[Egypt]] as part of the [[1978 Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt and Israel]] in hopes of establishing a genuine peace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====First Intifada and Oslo Accords====
From 1987 to 1993, the [[First Intifada|First Palestinian Intifada]] against Israel took place. Attempts at the [[peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] were made at the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]]. As the process progressed, in 1993 the Israelis allowed Chairman and President of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] [[Yassir Arafat]] to return to the region.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the historic [[1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israel]] (the &quot;Oslo Accords&quot;), which gave the Palestinian Arabs limited self-rule in some parts of the Disputed Territories through the [[Palestinian Authority]], and other detailed negotiations, [[proposals for a Palestinian state]] gained momentum. They were soon followed in 1993 by the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]]. To date, efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in deadlock, and the people of the region, Jews and Arabs, are engaged in a bloody conflict, called variously the &quot;[[Arab-Israeli conflict]]&quot; or &quot;[[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====21st century====
After few years of on-and-off negotiations, the Palestinians began an uprising against Israel. This was known as the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]]. The events were highlighted in world media by Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel that killed many civilians, and by [[Israeli Security Forces]] full fledged invasions into civilian areas&lt;ref name=&quot;baroud2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mondediplo.com/2007/07/06gaza|first=Ramzy |last =Baroud| title=Gaza: chaos foretold | publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |month=July | year=2007 | accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with some [[targeted killing]]s of Palestinian militant leaders and organizers. Israel began building a complex [[Israeli West Bank barrier|security barrier]] to block suicide bombers invading into Israel from the West Bank in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Also in 2002, the [[Road map for peace]] calling for the resolution of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] was proposed by a &quot;quartet&quot;: the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Russia]], and [[United Nations]]. [[President of the United States of America|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in a speech on June 24, 2002 called for an [[independent Palestinian state]] living side by side with [[Israel]] in peace. Bush was the first U.S. President to explicitly call for such a Palestinian state.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004]], it withdrew all settlers and most of the military presence from the Gaza strip, but maintained control of the air space and coast. Israel also dismantled four settlements in northern West Bank in September 2005. Following Israel's withdrawal, Palestinian militia groups fired [[Qassam rocket]]s into Israel and [[smuggling tunnels|smuggled]] weapons and ammunition into Gaza from [[Egypt]]. After the kidnap of Israeli soldiers in June 2006, Israel launched a military operation and reentered some parts of the Gaza Strip. Amidst severe criticism, they built the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Following the January 2006 election of the [[Hamas]] government, Fatah resistance took the form of street battles that resulted in a victory for Hamas.&lt;ref name=&quot;baroud2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IA09Ak03.html| title =No-goodniks and the Palestinian shootout| publisher=Asia Times |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas took over the ministries of the (Fatah) Palestinian Authority and Gaza became a Hamas enclave outside PA control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

As of July 2009, approximately 305,000 Israelis live in 121 settlements in the West Bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz-27July2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1103125.html |title=IDF: More than 300,000 settlers live in West Bank |publisher=haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2.4 million{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} West Bank Palestinians (according to Palestinian evaluations) live primarily in four blocs centered in [[Hebron]], [[Ramallah]], [[Nablus]], and [[Jericho]]. In 2005, Israel withdrew its army and all the Israeli settlers were evacuated from the [[Gaza Strip]], in keeping with [[Ariel Sharon]]'s plan for unilateral disengagement, and control over the area was transferred to the [[Palestinian Authority]]. However, due to the [[Hamas-Fatah conflict]],and to local elections, the Gaza Strip has been in control of [[Hamas]] since 2006. Even after this disengagement, the UN, [[Human Rights Watch]], and many other international bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip because Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, and does not allow the movement of goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI_briefing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/007/2009/en/4c407b40-e64c-11dd-9917-ed717fa5078d/mde150072009en.html|title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability|date=2009-01-19|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isrlpa13698&quot;&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm &quot;Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories&quot;] July 6, 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn2009-01-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory?|last=Levs|first=Josh|date=2009-01-06|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
