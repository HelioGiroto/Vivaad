The '''history of Austria''' covers the history of [[Austria]] and its predecessor states, from the farming communities of the early [[Stone Age]], through to the present sovereign state. The name ''Ostarrîchi'' (Austria) has been in use since 996 CE when it was a [[margravate]] of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] and from 1156 an independent [[archduchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German nation]] (''Heiliges Römisches Reich'' 962–1806). During this time Austria was dominated by the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] (''Haus Österreich'') from 1273 to 1806 when the empire came to an end. Austria then emerged in to the nineteenth century as the [[Austrian Empire]], a part of the [[German Confederation]] until the  Austro-Prussian War of 1866 excluded her, after which Austria continued as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (1867–1918) as a dual kingdom with [[Hungary]]. When this empire collapsed in 1918 after the end of [[World War I]], Austria was reduced to the main German speaking areas of the empire corresponding to its current frontiers and adopted the name [[German Austria]], since it wanted to join the new German [[Weimar Republic]]. This union was forbidden by the victorious Allies at the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Following the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]] (1918-1933) [[Austrofascism]] tried to keep Austria independent from the German Reich and in 1938 was [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] with the support of a large part of the [[Austrians|Austrian people]]. After the [[Second World War]] Austria again became an independent republic as the [[Second Austrian Republic|Second Republic]] in 1955 and joined the [[European Union]] in 1995.

== Historiography ==
The history of Austria creates a number of problems. For instance, should it be confined to the current relatively small Republic of German-Austria, dating from the end of the First World War, or to all lands that fell under the various rulers of what is now known as Austria? Should Austrian history include 1938-1945 when it no longer existed, having been annexed to the German Third Reich? Of the lands now encompassed in modern Austria, many were added over time and only two of the nine provinces or ''Länder'' are strictly 'Austria', namely the 'core' provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria, while other parts are now included in surrounding countries such as Italy or the Czech Republic. Within Austria there are large regional variations, and parts of Austria have at various times wished to become part of adjacent countries. (Beller 2006, 2-9).

== Overview ==
Human habitation of current Austria can be traced back to the first farming communities of the early [[Stone Age]] ([[Paleolithic era]]). In the late Iron Age it was occupied by a [[Celts|Celtic]] culture (ca. 800 BCE), the first organised nation state being the [[Celts|Celtic]] Kingdom of [[Noricum]] dating from ca. 800-400 BCE. This subsequently became incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]]'s lands to the south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the first century BC, and was incorporated as the [[Roman province|Province of Noricum]] around 40 AD. The most important Roman settlement was that at [[Carnuntum]]. Later, in the sixth century, another Celto-Germanic people, the [[Bavarii]] occupied these lands until it fell under the [[Frankish Empire]] in the ninth century. Around 800 AD Charlemagne established an the outpost of [[Avar March]] (''Awarenmark'') in what is now [[Lower Austria]], to hold back advances from [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] from the East. 

In the tenth century an eastern (east of the River [[Enns (river)|Enns]]) outpost of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]],  bordering [[Hungary]], was established as the ''[[Marchia orientalis]]'' (March of the East) or '[[Name of Austria|Margraviate of Austria]]' in 976, ruled by the [[Margraves]] of [[Babenberg]]. This 'Eastern March' (borderland), in German was known as ''Ostarrîchi'' or 'Eastern Realm', [[Name of Austria|hence 'Austria]]'. The first mention of ''Ostarrîchi'' occurs in a document of that name dated 996 CE. From 1156 the Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] created an independent duchy ([[Privilegium Minus]]) under the [[House of Babenberg]], until its extinction in 1246, corresponding to modern [[Lower Austria]]. 

Following the Babenberg dynasty and a brief [[interregnum]], Austria came under the rule of the [[List of German monarchs|German king]] [[Rudolf I]] of Habsburg (1276 – 1282), beginning a [[Hapsburg Dynasty|dynasty]] that would last through seven centuries becoming progressively distinct from neighbouring [[Bavaria]], within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The fifteenth and early sixteenth century saw considerable extension of the Habsburg territories through diplomatic means and marriage ties to include [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]] and parts of [[Italy]]. This expansionism, together with French aspirations and the resultant [[France–Habsburg rivalry|Habsburg-French or Bourbon-Habsburg rivalry]] were important factors shaping [[European History]] for 200 years (1516-1756). By the Treaty of Worms (''Wormser Vertrag'') of April 28 1521 the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ([[Archduchy of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] 1519–1521) split the dynasty, bestowing the hereditary [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian lands]] (''Österreichische Länder'') on his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] (1521–1564) and the first central administrative structures were established. By 1526 Ferdinand had also inherited the kingdoms of [[Bohemia]], and Hungary after the [[Battle of Mohács]] which partitioned the latter. However the [[Ottoman Empire]] now lay directly adjacent to the Austrian lands. Even after the unsuccessful first [[Siege of Vienna]] by the Turks in 1529, the Ottoman threat persisted for another one and a half centuries.    

The 16th Century also saw the spread of the [[Reformation]] through the Austrian lands. From around 1600 the Habsburg policy of recatholicisation or Catholic Renewal (''Rekatholisierung'') was to eventually lead to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), initially a [[protestant]]-[[catholic]] struggle. However it was also a struggle for power in central Europe, particularly the French opposition to the consolidation of power by the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire. Eventually the pressure of the anti-Habsburg coalition of France, Sweden, and most Protestant German states contained their authority to the Austrian and Czech lands in 1648.  

In 1683, the Ottoman forces were beaten back from Vienna a [[Battle of Vienna|second time]] and eventually, in the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1699), pushed back behind [[Belgrade]]. When the main (Spanish) line of the Habsburgs died out in 1700, it precipitated the [[War of Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714) between the Habsburgs and [[King Louis XIV of France]]. Subsequently Austria gained control, through the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]], of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Naples]] and [[Lombardy]]. 

These acquisitions together with conquests in the [[Balkans]] gave Austria its greatest territorial extent to date. 1713 also saw the [[Pragmatic Sanction]], designed to prevent any further division of the territory. But when [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] (Archduke 1711 – 1740) died and was succeeded by his daughter, Maria Theresa (1740-1780) Austria was perceived as weak by her neighbours since she could not be Empress in her own right, leading to the [[War of Austrian Succession]] (1740 – 1748) and the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). Subsequently Austria lost [[Silesia]] to [[Prussia]]. These [[Silesian Wars]] initiated a long standing tension between Austria and Prussia over imperial policy. Maria Theresa effectively reigned as Empress through her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen of Lorraine]] (d. 1765) and they therefore founded the new dynasty of Habsburg-Lorraine. During her reign extensive reforms were initiated, and when Francis died in 1765, these were continued by her son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (Emperor 1765-1790; Archduke 1780-1790). However his brother, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] (1790-1792), who succeeded him was much more conservative.    

Austria remained part of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806. Following the coronation of [[Napoleon I]] in 1804, the then emperor and archduke [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] (1792-1835) responded by proclaiming the [[Empire of Austria]]. In 1806 he resigned the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which then ceased to exist. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]], which restored order to Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, Austria became part of the [[German Confederation]] till the [[Austro-Prussian war]] of 1866, and then the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] which collapsed at the end of [[World War I]]. Austria was briefly independent ([[First Republic of Austria|First Republic]]) till [[Anschluss|annexation by the German Third Reich]], partitioned after the [[Second World War]] and then became the independent sovereign state ([[Austria|Second Republic]]) that has existed to the present day.

== Geography and geology ==
{{See also|Geography of Austria}}
[[File:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|right|250px|Topographical map of Austria]]
[[File:Austria satellite Grosslandschaften markerstyle.png|thumb|right|250px|Satellite image of the Geographical regions of Austria]]
The modern state of Austria is considered to have three major zones. The Austrian [[Alps]] which cover the majority (62%) of Austria's land mass, consists of most of the Eastern Alps together with the northern edge of the Southern Alps in the west and south of the country. To the north of the [[Danube]] lies the Austrian (southern) portion of the [[Bohemian Massif]] known as the [[Bohemian Forest]] (''Böhmerwald''), a relatively lower mountain range of [[granite]] (10% of the Austrian land area). In German, this area is also known as the Granite and [[Gneiss]] Plateau (''Granit- und Gneisplateau''). The remaining third of the country consists of the foothills and lower lying areas along the Danube valley between the two mountain ranges in the centre, and the eastern plains along the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border, forming the western edge of the [[Pannonian Basin]]. 

The Bohemian Massif and its foothills were formed in the [[Variscan orogeny]] of the late [[Paleozoic]] era. Another important element of Austrian geology and [[Geography of Austria|geography]] is the late [[Mesozoic]] [[Alpine orogeny]], and the subsequent formation of the [[Paratethys]] ocean and [[Molasse Basin]] in the [[Cretaceous]] era. 

The extensive alpine regions are sparsely populated, and form a barrier to passage of peoples apart from strategic passes which have provided access to [[Italy]]. Austria is positioned between the eastern European countries and central-western Europe, a position that has dictated much of its history. The Danube Valley has always been an important corridor from the West to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Orient]].

== Prehistory ==

=== Paleolithic ===
[[File:Venus von Willendorf 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Venus of Willendorf]], ca. 25,000 BCE. [[Naturhistorisches Museum]], Vienna]]
The Alps were inaccessible during the [[Ice Age]], so human habitation dates no earlier than the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era, during the time of the [[Neanderthals]]. The oldest traces of human habitation in Austria, more than 250,000 years ago, were found in the Repolust Cave at Badl, near [[Peggau]] in the [[Graz-Umgebung]] district of [[Styria]]. These include stone tools, bone tools and pottery fragments together with mammalian remains. Some 70,000 year-old evidence was found in the Gudenus Cave in northwestern Lower Austria. 

[[Upper Paleolithic]] remains are more numerous. The best known are in the [[Wachau]] region, including the sites of the two oldest pieces of art in Austria. These are figurative representations of women, the [[Venus of Galgenberg]] found near [[Stratzing]] and thought to be 32,000 years old, and the nearby [[Venus of Willendorf]] (26,000 years old) found at [[Willendorf]], near [[Krems an der Donau]]. In 2005 in the same area in 2005, a double infant burial site was discovered at Krems-Wachtberg, dating from [[Gravettian]] culture (27,000 years old), the oldest burial ground found in Austria to date.

During the Neolithic era, the territory of modern-day Austria was home to the [[Linear pottery culture]], one of the first agrarian cultures in Europe.

=== Chalcolithic ===
[[Ötzi the Iceman]], a well-preserved mummy of a man frozen in Austrian Alps, is dated around 3300 BC.

==Celtic and Roman==
[[File:REmpire-Noricum.png|thumb|250px|Province of Noricum highlighted]]
[[File:Austria Romana.png|thumb|250px|Roman provinces corresponding to modern Austria]]

[[Noricum]], in [[ancient history|ancient]] [[geography]], was a [[Celts|Celtic]] kingdom (perhaps better described as a federation of, by tradition, twelve tribes) stretching over the area of today's [[Austria]] and a part of [[Slovenia]]. It became a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was bounded on the north by the [[Danube]], on the west by [[Raetia]] and [[Vindelicia]], on the east and southeast by [[Pannonia]], on the south by Region 10, [[Italia (Roman Empire)|''Venetia et Histria'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wagna.at/flaviasolva/sites/flavia2.html  see detailed map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Middle Ages==

During the [[Migration Period]], the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe of the Carantanians [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|migrated into the Alps]] in the wake of the expansion of their [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] overlords during the 7th century, mixed with the [[Celto-Romanic]] population, and established the realm of [[Carantania]], which covered much of eastern and central Austrian territory. In the meantime, the [[Germanic tribe]] of the [[baiuvarii|Bavarians]] had developed in the 5th and 6th century in the west of the country and in [[Bavaria]], while what is today [[Vorarlberg]] had been settled by the [[Alemans]]. Those groups mixed with the [[Romansh people|Rhaeto-Romanic]] population and pushed it up into the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBS&quot;&gt;Gordon Brook-Shepherd, ''The Austrians: a thousand-year odyssey'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Carantania, under pressure of the Avars, lost its independence to [[Bavaria]] in 745 and divided between Bavaria (western part) and [[Avar Khaganate]] (eastern part). Bavarian part of it became a [[margraviate]]. During the following centuries, Bavarian settlers went down the Danube and up the Alps, a process through which Austria was to become the mostly German-speaking country it is today.

The Bavarians themselves came under the overlordship of the [[Carolingian]] [[Franks]] and subsequently became a [[duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo III]], who wanted to maintain Bavarian independence, was defeated and displaced by [[Charlemagne]] in 789. An eastern march (military borderland), the [[Avar March]], was established in Charlemagne's time, but it was overrun by the [[Hungarians]] in 909.

==Babenberg Austria==
[[File:Ostarrichi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ostarrîchi]] from [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]]]]
{{Main|March of Austria}}
{{details|Babenbergs}}
After the defeat of the Hungarians by Emperor [[Otto the Great]] in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (955), new marches were established in what is today Austria. The one known as the ''[[marchia orientalis]]'' was to become the core territory of Austria and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976 after the revolt of [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria]].

The [[marches]] were overseen by a ''comes'' or ''dux'' as appointed by the emperor. These titles are usually translated as count or duke, but these terms conveyed very different meanings in the [[Early Middle Ages]], so the [[Latin]] versions are to be preferred. In lumbardi-speaking countries, the title was eventually regularized to ''[[margrave]]'' (German: ''markgraf'') i.e. &quot;count of the mark&quot;.

The first recorded instance of the name Austria appeared in 996, written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March. The term [[March of Austria|Ostmark]] is not historically certain and appears to be a translation of ''marchia orientalis'' that came up only much later.

The following centuries were characterized first by the settlement of the country, when forests were cleared and towns and monasteries were founded. In 1156 the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] through the [[Georgenberg Pact]]. At that time, the Babenberg Dukes came to be one of the most influential ruling families in the region, peaking in the reign of [[Leopold VI of Austria|Leopold VI]] (1198–1230).&lt;ref name=&quot;GBS&quot;/&gt;

However, with the slaughter of his son [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line went extinct, which resulted in the ''[[interregnum]]'', a period of several decades during which the status of the country was disputed. [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Otakar II Přemysl of Bohemia]] effectively controlled the duchies of Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]]. His reign came to an end with his defeat in the [[battle of Dürnkrut and Jedenspeigen]] at the hand of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf of Habsburg]] in 1278.

Following the extinction of the Babenbergs in the 13th century, Austria came briefly under the rule of the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]]. Contesting the election of [[Rudolf I of Habsburg]] as emperor, Ottokar was defeated and killed by Rudolf, who took Austria with the assistance of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]].

==The beginnings of the Habsburg Monarchy (1278–1526)==
{{See also|Habsburg Monarchy}}
[[File:Albrecht Dürer 084b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] portrayed by [[Albrecht Dürer]] 1519]]
Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg gave Austria to his sons in 1278. Austria was ruled by the [[Habsburgs]] for the next 640 years (13th century–1918). In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria, which remained a small territory along the Danube, and Styria, which they had acquired from Ottokar along with Austria. [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]] came under Habsburg rule in 1335, [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] in 1363. These provinces, together, became known as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands, although they were sometimes all lumped together simply as Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the notable but short reign of [[Rudolf IV of Austria|Rudolf IV]] (the first to claim the title of Archduke of Austria), his brothers [[Albert III of Austria|Albert III]] and [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III]] split the realms in the [[Treaty of Neuberg]] in 1379. Albert retained Austria proper, while Leopold took the remaining territories. In 1402, there was another split in the ''[[Leopoldian line]]'', when [[Ernest of Austria (Habsburg)|Ernest the Iron]] took [[Inner Austria]] (Styria, Carinthia and Carniola) and [[Frederick IV of Austria|Frederick IV]] became ruler of Tyrol and [[Further Austria]]. The territories were only reunified by Ernest's son [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick V]] (Frederick III as Holy Roman Emperor), when the ''[[Albertinian line]]'' (1457) and the [[List of Austrian consorts#Elder Tyrolean line|''Elder Tyrolean line'']] (1490) had become extinct.

In 1438, Duke Albert V of Austria was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, from then on, every emperor was a Habsburg, with only one exception, and Austria's rulers wee also the Holy Roman Emperors, till 1806. The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the Hereditary Lands. In 1477, the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Low Countries]] for the family. His son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married the heiress of Castile and Aragon, and thus acquired Spain and its Italian, African, and New World appendages for the Habsburgs.  The Habsburgs' hereditary territories, however, were soon separated from this enormous empire when, in 1520, [[Emperor Charles V]] left them to the rule of his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]].

==Austria in the Reformation (1526–1618)==
[[File:Juliusz Kossak Sobieski pod Wiedniem.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Vienna]]]]

In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], in which Ferdinand's brother-in-law [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II, King of Hungary and Bohemia]], was killed, Ferdinand expanded his territories, bringing Bohemia and that part of Hungary not occupied by the Ottomans under his rule.  Habsburg expansion into Hungary, however, led to frequent conflicts with the Turks, particularly the so-called [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606.

Austria and the other Habsburg hereditary provinces (and Hungary and Bohemia, as well) were much affected by the Reformation. Although the Habsburg rulers themselves remained Catholic, the provinces themselves largely converted to Lutheranism, which Ferdinand I and his successors, [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], and [[Mathias, Holy Roman Emperor|Mathias]] largely tolerated.

In the late 16th century, however, the Counter-Reformation and the [[Society of Jesus]] began to make its influence felt, and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit-educated]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand of Austria]], who ruled over [[Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], and [[Carniola]] before becoming Holy Roman Emperor, was energetic in suppressing heresy in the provinces which he ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648)==
When, in 1619, he was elected Emperor to succeed his cousin Mathias, the ultra-pious and intransigent [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], as he became known, embarked on an energetic attempt to re-Catholicize not only the Hereditary Provinces, but Bohemia and Habsburg Hungary as well as most of Protestant Europe within the Holy Roman Empire. Outside his lands, his reputation for strong headed uncompromising intolerance had triggered the [[Thirty Years' War]] in May 1618 in the polarizing first phase, known as the Revolt in Bohemia. After several initial reverses, he became accommodating but as the Catholics turned things around and began to enjoy a long string of successes at arms he set forth the [[Edict of Restitution]] in 1629 vastly complicating the politics of settlement negotiations and prolonging the rest of the war; encouraged by the mid-war successes, he became even more forceful leading to infamies by his armies such as the [[Sack of Magdeburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) pp 45-53&lt;/ref&gt;

His forced conversions or evictions carried out in the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which with the later general success of the Protestants therefore had greatly negative consequences for Habsburg control of the Holy Roman Empire itself, while these campaigns within the Habsburg hereditary lands were largely successful in religiously purifying his demesnes, leaving the Austrian Emperors thereafter with much greater control within their hereditary power base&amp;mdash; although Hungary was never successfully re-Catholicized&amp;mdash;but one much reduced in population and economic might while less vigorous and weakened as a [[nation-state]].

In terms of human costs, the [[Thirty Years' war]]s many economic, social, and population dislocations caused by the hardline methods adopted by Ferdinand's strict counter-reformation measures and almost continual employment of mercenary field armies contributed significantly to the loss of life and tragic depopulation of all [[list of the states of the Holy Roman Empire|the German states]], during a war which some estimates put the civilian loss of life as high as fifty-percent overall. Studies mostly cite the causes of death due to starvation or as caused (ultimately by the lack-of-food induced) weakening of resistance to endemic diseases which repeatedly reached epidemic proportions amongst the general Central European population&amp;mdash;the German states were the battle ground and staging areas for the largest mercenary armies theretofore, and the armies foraged amongst the many provinces stealing the food of those people forced onto the roads as refugees, or still on the lands, regardless of their faith and allegiances. Both townsmen and farmers were repeatedly ravaged and victimized by the armies on both sides leaving little for the populations already stressed by the refugees from the war or fleeing the Catholic counter-reformation repressions under Ferdinand's governance.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao,  ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618-1815'' (2nd ed. 2000) pp 23-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria's rise to power (1657–1714)==
The culmination of the Austrian conflict with the Turks came during the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705).  Following the successful defense of [[Battle of Vienna|Vienna]] in 1683 led by King of Poland [[John III Sobieski]],  a series of campaigns resulted in the return of all of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.  At the same time, Austria was becoming more involved in competition with France in Western Europe, with Austria fighting the French in the [[Third Dutch War]] (1672–1679), the [[War of the League of Augsburg]] (1688–1697) and finally the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), in which the French and Austrians (along with their British, Dutch and Catalonian allies) fought over the inheritance of the vast territories of the Spanish Habsburgs.  Although the French secured control of Spain and its colonies for a grandson of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Austrians also ended up making significant gains in Western Europe, including the former [[Spanish Netherlands]] (now called the Austrian Netherlands, including most of modern Belgium), the [[Duchy of Milan]] in Northern Italy, and Naples and Sardinia in Southern Italy.  (The latter was traded for Sicily in 1720).&lt;ref&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711–1780)==

The later part of the reign of [[Emperor Charles VI]] (1711–1740) saw Austria relinquish many of these fairly impressive gains, largely due to Charles's apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg.  Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir.  The most notable instance of this was in the [[War of the Polish Succession]] whose settlement saw Austria cede Naples and Sicily to the Spanish Infante [[Charles III of Spain|Don Carlos]] in exchange for the tiny Duchy of [[Parma]] and Spain and France's adherence to the Pragmatic Sanction.  The latter years of Charles's reign (1736–1739) also saw an unsuccessful war against the Turks, which resulted in the Austrian loss of Belgrade and other border territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) pp 90-101&lt;/ref&gt;

And, as many had anticipated, when Charles died in 1740, all those assurances from the other powers proved of little worth to Maria Theresa.  The peace was initially broken by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]], who invaded [[Silesia]].  Soon other powers began to exploit Austria's weakness.  The [[Emperor Charles VII|Elector of Bavaria]] claimed the inheritance to the hereditary lands and Bohemia, and was supported by the King of France, who desired the Austrian Netherlands.  The Spanish and Sardinians hoped to gain territory in Italy, and the Saxons hoped to gain territory to connect Saxony with the Elector's Polish Kingdom.  Austria's allies—Britain, Holland, and Russia, were all wary of getting involved in the conflict.  Thus began the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748), one of the more confusing and less eventful wars of European history, which ultimately saw Austria holding its own, despite the permanent loss of most of Silesia to the Prussians.  In 1745, following the reign of the [[Bavaria]]n [[prince-elector|Elector]] as [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VII]], Maria Theresa's husband [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis of Lorraine]], [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]], was elected Emperor, restoring control of that position to the Habsburgs (or, rather, to the new composite house of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1980 c5&quot;&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918'' (2nd ed. 1980) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;

For the eight years following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] that ended the War of the Austrian Succession, Maria Theresa plotted revenge on the Prussians.  The British and Dutch allies who had proved so reluctant to help her in her time of need were dropped in favour of the French in the so-called [[Diplomatic Revolution|Reversal of Alliances]] of 1756.  That same year, war once again erupted on the continent as Frederick, fearing encirclement, launched a pre-emptive invasion of Saxony.  The [[Seven Years' War]], too, was indecisive, and saw Prussia holding onto Silesia, despite Russia, France, and Austria all combining against him, and with only Hanover as a significant ally on land.

The end of the war saw Austria, exhausted, continuing the alliance with France (cemented in 1770 with the marriage of Maria Theresa's daughter [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Archduchess Maria Antonia]] to the [[Louis XVI of France|Dauphin]]), but also facing a dangerous situation in Central Europe, faced with the alliance of [[Friedrich II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] and [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] of Russia.  The [[Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1768–1774 caused a serious crisis in east-central Europe, with Prussia and Austria demanding compensation for Russia's gains in the Balkans, ultimately leading to the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, in which Maria Theresa took [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] from Austria's traditional ally.

Over the next several years, Austro-Russian relations began to improve.  When the [[War of Bavarian Succession]] erupted between Austria and Prussia in 1777 following the extinction of the Bavarian line of the [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty, Russia refused to support its ally, and the war was ended, after almost no bloodshed, on May 13, 1779 when Russian and French mediators at the [[Congress of Teschen]] negotiated an end to the war. In the agreement Austria receive the [[Innviertel]] from Bavaria.

==Joseph II and Leopold II (1780–1792)==
[[File:Pompeo Batoni 002.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (right) with his brother and successor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] (left)]]

=== Joseph II (1780-1790) ===
On Maria Theresa's death in 1780, she was succeeded by her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], already [[Holy Roman Emperor]] since Francis I's death in 1765.  A reformer herself, Maria Theresa always acted with a cautious respect for the conservatism of the political and social elites and the strength of local traditions. Her cautious approach repelled Joseph, who always sought the decisive, dramatic intervention to impose the one best solution, regardless of traditions or political opposition.  He was the archetypical embodiment of [[The Enlightenment]] spirit of the 18th-century reforming monarchs known as the [[Enlightened absolutism|&quot;enlightened despots&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamish H. Scott, ed. '' Enlightened Absolutism: Reform and Reformers in Later Eighteenth-Century Europe'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph and his mother were typically at odds on policy, and their quarrels were usually mediated by the chancellor, [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Prince Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]]  (1711–94), who served nearly 40 years as the principal minister to Maria Theresa and Joseph.  When Maria Theresa died in 1780, Joseph became the absolute ruler over the most extensive realm of Central Europe. There was no parliament to deal with. Joseph was always positive that the rule of reason, as propounded in the Enlightenment, would produce the best possible results in the shortest time.  He issued edicts—6,000 in all, plus 11,000 new laws designed to regulate and reorder every aspect of the empire. The spirit was benevolent and paternal. He intended to make his people happy, but strictly in accordance with his own criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1980 c5&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Josephism,&quot; as his policies were called, is notable for the very wide range of reforms designed to modernize the creaky empire in an era when France and Prussia were rapidly upgrading. Josephism elicited grudging compliance at best, and more often vehement opposition from all sectors in every part of his empire. Failure characterized most of his projects.  Joseph set about building a rational, centralized, and uniform government for his diverse lands, a pyramid with himself as supreme autocrat. He expected government servants to all be dedicated agents of Josephism and selected them without favor for class or ethnic origins; promotion was solely by merit. To impose uniformity, he made German the compulsory language of official business throughout the Empire. The Hungarian assembly was stripped of its prerogatives, and not even called together

As privy finance minister, Count [[Karl von Zinzendorf]] (1739–1813) introduced a uniform system of accounting for state revenues, expenditures, and debts of the territories of the Austrian crown. Austria was more successful than France in meeting regular expenditures and in gaining credit. However, the events of Joseph II's last years also suggest that the government was financially vulnerable to the European wars that ensued after 1792.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. M. Dickson, &quot;Count Karl von Zinzendorf's 'New Accountancy': the Structure of Austrian Government Finance in Peace and War, 1781-1791.&quot; ''International History Review'' 2007 29(1): 22-56. Issn: 0707-5332&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph reformed the traditional legal system, abolished brutal punishments and the death penalty in most instances, and imposed the principle of complete equality of treatment for all offenders. He ended censorship of the press and theatre.

In 1781-82 he extended full legal freedom to serfs. Rentals paid by peasants were to be regulated by imperial (not local) officials and taxes were levied upon all income derived from land. The landlords saw a grave threat to their status and incomes, and eventually reversed the policy. In Hungary and Transylvania, the resistance of the landed nobility was so great that Joseph compromised with halfway measures—one of the few times he backed down. After the great peasant revolt of Horea, 1784–85, however, the emperor imposed his will by fiat. His Imperial Patent of 1785 abolished serfdom but did not give the peasants ownership of the land or freedom from dues owed to the landowning nobles. It did give them personal freedom. Emancipation of the Hungarian peasantry promoted the growth of a new class of taxable landholders, but it did not abolish the deep-seated ills of feudalism and the exploitation of the landless squatters.

To equalize the incidence of taxation, Joseph ordered a fresh appraisal of the value of all properties in the empire; his goal was to impose a single and egalitarian tax on land.  The goal was to modernize the relationship of dependence between the landowners and peasantry, relieve some of the tax burden on the peasantry, and increase state revenues. Joseph looked on the tax and land reforms as being interconnected and strove to implement them at the same time. The various commissions he established to formulate and carry out the reforms met resistance among the nobility, the peasantry, and some officials. Most of the reforms were abrogated shortly before or after Joseph's death in 1790; they were doomed to failure from the start because they tried to change too much in too short a time, and tried to radically alter the traditional customs and relationships that the villagers had long depended upon.

In the cities the new economic principles of the Enlightenment called for the destruction of the autonomous guilds, already weakened during the age of mercantilism. Joseph II's tax reforms and the institution of Katastralgemeinde (tax districts for the large estates) served this purpose, and new factory privileges ended guild rights while customs laws aimed at economic unity. The intellectual influence of the [[Physiocrats]] led to the inclusion of agriculture in these reforms.

====Education and medicine====
To produce a literate citizenry, elementary education was made compulsory for all boys and girls, and higher education on practical lines was offered for a select few.  He created scholarships for talented poor students, and allowed the establishment of schools for Jews and other religious minorities. In 1784 he ordered that the country change its language of instruction from Latin to German, a highly controversial step in a multilingual empire.

By the 18th century, centralization was the trend in medicine because more and better educated doctors requesting improved facilities; cities lacked the budgets to fund local hospitals; and the monarchy's wanted to end costly epidemics and quarantines. Joseph attempted to centralize medical care in Vienna through the construction of a single, large hospital, the famous Allgemeines Krankenhaus, which opened in 1784. Centralization worsened sanitation problems causing epidemics a 20% death rate in the new hospital. which undercut Joseph's plan, but the city became preeminent in the medical field in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul P. Bernard, &quot;The Limits of Absolutism: Joseph II and the Allgemeines Krankenhaus.&quot; ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 1975 9(2): 193-215. Issn: 0013-2586 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2737597 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion====
Joseph's goals were to weaken the power of the Catholic Church and introduce a policy of religious toleration that was the most advanced of any state in Europe.  In 1789 he issued a charter of religious toleration for the Jews of Galicia, a region with a large Yiddish-speaking traditional Jewish population.  The charter abolished communal autonomy whereby the Jews controlled their internal affairs; it promoted Germanization and the wearing of non-Jewish clothing.

Probably the most unpopular of all his reforms was his attempted modernization of the highly traditional Roman Catholic Church. Calling himself the guardian of Catholicism, Joseph II struck vigorously at [[Papacy, history|papal power]]. He tried to make the Catholic Church in his empire the tool of the state, independent of Rome. Clergymen were deprived of the tithe and ordered to study in seminaries under government supervision, while bishops had to take a formal oath of loyalty to the crown. He financed the large increase in bishoprics, parishes, and secular clergy by extensive sales of monastic lands.  As a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] he ridiculed the contemplative monastic orders, which he considered unproductive. Accordingly, he suppressed a third of the monasteries (over 700 were closed) and reduced the number of monks and nuns from 65,000 to 27,000. Church courts were abolished and marriage was defined as a civil contract outside the jurisdiction of the Church.

Josph sharply cut the number of holy days and reduced ornamentation in churches. He greatly simplified the manner of celebration. The results of these reforms included a deepening crisis of faith; the disappearance of piety; and the decline of morality. Opponents of the reforms blamed them for revealing Protestant tendencies, with the rise of Enlightenment rationalism and the emergence of a liberal class of bourgeois officials. Anti-clericalism emerged and persisted, while the traditional Catholics were energized in opposition to the emperor.

====Foreign policy====
The Habsburg Empire developed a policy of war and trade as well as intellectual influence across the borders. While opposing Prussia and Turkey, Austria was friendly to Russia though trying to remove Romania from Russian influence.

In foreign policy, there was no Enlightenment, only hunger for more territory and a willingness to undertake unpopular wars to get the land. Joseph was a belligerent, expansionist leader, who dreamed of making his Empire the greatest of the European powers. Joseph's plan was to acquire Bavaria, if necessary in exchange for Belgium (the Austrian Netherlands), but in 1778 and again in 1785 he was thwarted by King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] of Prussia, who had a much stronger army. This failure caused Joseph to seek territorial expansion in the Balkans, where he became involved in an expensive and futile war with the Turks 1787-1791, which was the price to be paid for friendship with Russia.

The Balkan policy of both Maria Theresa and Joseph II reflected the [[Cameralism]] promoted by Prince Kaunitz, stressing consolidation of the border lands by reorganization and expansion of the military frontier.  [[Transylvania]] was incorporated into the frontier in 1761 and the frontier regiments became the backbone of the military order, with the regimental commander exercising military and civilian power. &quot;Populationistik&quot; was the prevailing theory of colonization, which measured prosperity in terms of labor. Joseph II also stressed economic development. Habsburg influence was an essential factor in Balkan development in the last half of the 18th century, especially for the Serbs and Croats.

====Reaction====
The nobility throughout his empire hated Joseph: they hated his taxes, his egalitarianism, his despotism and his puritanism. In Belgium and Hungary everyone resented the way he tried to do away with all regional government, and to subordinate everything to his own personal rule in Vienna. The ordinary people were not happy. They loathed the Emperor's interference in every detail of their daily lives. Why should they be forbidden to bake ginger-bread just because Joseph thought it bad for the stomach? Why the Imperial edict demanding the breast-feeding of infants? Why the banning of corsets? From these and a thousand other petty regulations, enforced by a secret police, it looked to the Austrians as though Joseph were trying to reform their characters as well as their institutions Only a few weeks before Joseph's death, the director of the Imperial Police reported to him: &quot;All classes, and even those who have the greatest respect for the sovereign, are discontented and indignant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saul K. Padover, ''The Revolutionary Emperor, Joseph the Second 1741-1790.'' (1934) pp 384-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lombardy (in northern Italy) the cautious reforms of Maria Theresa in Lombardy enjoyed support from local reformers. Joseph II, however, by creating a powerful imperial officialdom directed from Vienna, undercut the dominant position of the Milanese principate and the traditions of jurisdiction and administration. In the place of provincial autonomy he established an unlimited centralism, which reduced Lombardy politically and economically to a fringe area of the Empire. As a reaction to these radical changes the middle class reformers shifted away from cooperation to strong resistance. From this basis appeared the beginnings of the later Lombard liberalism.

By 1790 rebellions had broken out in protest against Joseph's reforms in Belgium and Hungary, and his other dominions were restive under the burdens of his war with Turkey. His empire was threatened with dissolution, and he was forced to sacrifice some of his reform projects. His health shattered by disease, alone, and unpopular in all his lands, the bitter emperor died February 20, 1790. He was not yet forty-nine.  Joseph II rode roughshod over age-old aristocratic privileges, liberties, and prejudices, thereby creating for himself many enemies, and they triumphed in the end. Joseph's attempt to reform the Hungarian lands illustrates the weakness of absolutism in the face of well-defended feudal liberties.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. M. Dickson, &quot;Monarchy and Bureaucracy in Late Eighteenth-century Austria.&quot; ''English Historical Review'' 1995 110(436): 323-367. Issn: 0013-8266 Fulltext: [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-8266%28199504%29110%3A436%3C323%3AMABILE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind his numerous reforms lay a comprehensive program influenced by the doctrines of enlightened absolutism, natural law, mercantilism, and physiocracy. With a goal of establishing a uniform legal framework to replace heterogeneous traditional structures, the reforms were guided at least implicitly by the principles of freedom and equality and were based on a conception of the state's central legislative authority. Joseph's accession marks a major break since the preceding reforms under Maria Theresa had not challenged these structures, but there was no similar break at the end of the Josephinian era. The reforms initiated by Joseph II had merit despite the way they were introduced. They were continued to varying degrees under his successors. They gained comprehensive &quot;Austrian&quot; form in the Allgemeine Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch of 1811 and have been seen as providing a foundation for subsequent reforms extending into the 20th century.

=== Leopold II (1790-1792) ===
Joseph's death proved a boon for Austria, as he was succeeded by his more sensible brother, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], previously the reforming [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]].  Leopold knew when to cut his losses, and soon cut deals with the revolting Netherlanders and Hungarians.  He also managed to secure a peace with Turkey in 1791, and negotiated an alliance with Prussia, which had been allying with Poland to press for war on behalf of the Ottomans against Austria and Russia.

Leopold's reign also saw the acceleration of the [[French Revolution]].  Although Leopold was sympathetic to the revolutionaries, he was also the brother of the French queen.  Furthermore, disputes involving the status of the rights of various imperial princes in [[Alsace]], where the revolutionary French government was attempting to remove rights guaranteed by various peace treaties, involved Leopold as Emperor in conflicts with the French.  The [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], made in late 1791 jointly with the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] and the [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], in which it was declared that the other princes of Europe took an interest in what was going on in France, was intended to be a statement in support of Louis XVI that would prevent the need from taking any kind of action.  However, it instead inflamed the sentiments of the revolutionaries against the Emperor.  Although Leopold did his best to avoid war with the French, he died in March 1792.  The French declared war on his inexperienced son [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] a month later.

=== The Arts ===
Vienna and Austria dominated European music during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, typified by the [[First Viennese School]] (''Wiener Klassik''). Initially the monarchy were the major patrons of the arts, till rising middle class aspirations incorporated music into the lives of the [[bourgeoisie]].

==French Revolution and Napoleon (1792–1815)==
[[File:Johann Peter Krafft 003.jpg|thumb|250px|Victorious [[Archduke Charles of Austria]] during the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (May 21&amp;ndash;22, 1809)]]
The war with France, which lasted until 1797, proved unsuccessful for Austria.  After some brief successes against the utterly disorganized French armies in early 1792, the tide turned, and the French overran the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in the last months of 1792.  While the Austrians were so occupied, their erstwhile Prussian allies stabbed them in the back with the [[Partitions of Poland|Second Partition of Poland]], from which Austria was entirely excluded.  This led to the dismissal of Francis's chief minister, [[Philipp von Cobenzl]], and his replacement with [[Franz Maria Thugut]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618-1815'' ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, the increasing radicalization of the French Revolution, as well as the French occupation of the Low Countries, brought Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Spain into the war, which became known as the [[War of the First Coalition]].  Once again, there were initial successes against the disorganized armies of the French Republic, and the Netherlands were recovered.  But in 1794 the tide turned once more, and Austrian forces were driven out of the Netherlands again—this time for good.  Meanwhile, the Polish Crisis again became critical, resulting in a Third Partition (1795), in which Austria managed to secure important gains.  The war in the west continued to go badly, as most of the coalition made peace, leaving Austria with only Britain and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] as allies.  In 1796, the [[French Directory]] planned a two-pronged campaign in Germany to force the Austrians to make peace, with a secondary thrust planned into Italy.  Although Austrian forces under [[Archduke Charles of Austria|Archduke Charles]], the Emperor's brother, were successful in driving the French back in Germany, the [[French Army of Italy]], under the command of the young Corsican General [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], was brilliantly successful, forcing Piedmont out of the war, driving the Austrians out of [[Lombardy]] and besieging [[Mantua]].  Following the capture of Mantua in early 1797, Bonaparte advanced north through the Alps against Vienna, while new French armies moved again into Germany.  Austria sued for peace.  By the terms of the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] of 1797, Austria renounced its claims to the Netherlands and Lombardy, in exchange for which it partitioned the territories of the [[Republic of Venice]] with the French.  The Austrians also provisionally recognized the French annexation of the Left Bank of the Rhine, and agreed in principle that the German princes of the region should be compensated with ecclesiastical lands on the other side of the Rhine.

The peace did not last for long.  Soon, differences emerged between the Austrians and French over the reorganization of Germany, and Austria joined Russia, Britain, and Naples in the [[War of the Second Coalition]] in 1799.  Although Austro-Russian forces were initially successful in driving the French from Italy, the tide soon turned—the Russians withdrew from the war after a defeat at [[First Battle of Zurich|Zürich]] (1799) which they blamed on Austrian recklessness, and the Austrians were defeated by Bonaparte, now [[French Consulate|First Consul]] at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]], which forced them to withdraw from Italy, and then in Germany at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]].  These defeats forced Thugut's resignation, and Austria, now led by [[Ludwig Cobenzl]], to make peace at [[Treaty of Lunéville|Lunéville]] in early 1801.  The terms were surprisingly mild—the terms of Campo Formio were largely reinstated, but now the way was clear for a reorganization of the Empire on French lines.  By the Imperial Deputation Report of 1803, the Holy Roman Empire was entirely reorganized, with nearly all of the ecclesiastical territories and free cities, traditionally the parts of the Empire most friendly to the House of Austria, eliminated.

[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|right|250px|Europe in 1812 after several French victories]]
With Bonaparte's assumption of the title of Emperor of the French in 1804, Francis, seeing the writing on the wall for the old Empire, took the new title of &quot;[[Austrian Empire|Emperor of Austria]]&quot; as Francis I, in addition to his title of Holy Roman Emperor.  Soon, Napoleon's continuing machinations in Italy, including the annexation of [[Genoa]] and [[Parma]], led once again to war in 1805—the [[War of the Third Coalition]], in which Austria, Britain, Russia, and Sweden took on Napoleon.  The Austrian forces began the war by invading [[Bavaria]], a key French ally in Germany, but were soon outmaneuvered and forced to surrender by Napoleon at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], before the main Austro-Russian force was defeated at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] on December 2.  By the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], Austria was forced to give up large amounts of territory—[[Dalmatia]] to France, [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] to Bavaria, and Austria's various Swabian territories to [[Baden Germany|Baden]] and [[Württemberg]], although [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], formerly held by Francis's younger brother, the previous Grand Duke of Tuscany, was annexed by Austria as compensation.

The defeat meant the end of the old Holy Roman Empire.  Napoleon's satellite states in southern and Western Germany seceded from the Empire in the summer of 1806, forming the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], and a few days later Francis proclaimed the Empire dissolved, and renounced the old imperial crown.

Over the next three years Austria, now led by [[Philipp Stadion]], attempted to maintain peace with France, but the overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons in 1808 was deeply disturbing to the Habsburgs, who rather desperately went to war once again in 1809, the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] this time with no continental allies, but the United Kingdom.  Stadion's attempts to generate popular uprisings in Germany were unsuccessful, and the Russians honored their alliance with France, so Austria was once again defeated at the [[Battle of Wagram]], although at greater cost than Napoleon, who had suffered his first battlefield defeat in this war, at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], had expected.  The terms of the subsequent [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] were quite harsh. Austria lost Salzburg to Bavaria, some of its Polish lands to Russia, and its remaining territory on the Adriatic (including much of Carinthia and Styria) to Napoleon's [[Illyrian Provinces]].

[[Klemens von Metternich]], the new Austrian foreign minister, aimed to pursue a pro-French policy.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger, ''A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812-22'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Emperor's daughter, [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie Louise]], was married to Napoleon, and Austria contributed an army to Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812.  With Napoleon's disastrous defeat in Russia at the end of the year, and Prussia's defection to the Russian side at the beginning of 1813, Metternich began slowly to shift his policy.  Initially he aimed to mediate a peace between France and its continental enemies, but when it became apparent that Napoleon was not interested in compromise, Austria joined the allies and declared war on France in August 1813.  The Austrian intervention was decisive.  Napoleon was defeated at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in October, and forced to withdraw into France itself.  As 1814 began, the Allied forces invaded France.  Initially, Metternich remained unsure as to whether he wanted Napoleon to remain on the throne, a Marie Louise regency for Napoleon's young son, or a Bourbon restoration, but he was eventually brought around by British Foreign Secretary [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] to the last position.  Napoleon abdicated on April 3, 1814, and Louis XVIII was restored, soon negotiating a peace treaty with the victorious allies at [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Paris]] in June.

Under the control of [[Metternich]], the Austrian Empire entered a period of [[censorship]] and a [[police state]] in the period between 1815 and 1848 (''[[Biedermaier]]'' or ''[[Vormärz]]'' period). The latter term (Before March) referring to the period prior to the revolution of March 1848. Metternich kept a firm hand on government resisting the constitutional freedoms demanded by the liberals. Government was by custom and by imperial decree (''Hofkanzleidekrete''). However, both [[liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] were on the rise, which resulted in the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]]. Metternich and the mentally handicapped Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] were forced to resign to be replaced by the emperor's young nephew [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].

=== Franz Joseph I and the Belle Époque (1848-1914) ===

==== Post revolutionary Austria 1848-1866 ====
Separatist tendencies (especially in [[Lombardy]] and Hungary) were suppressed by military force. A constitution was enacted in March 1848, but it had little practical impact, although [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1848|elections]] were held in June. The 1850s saw a return to neoabsolutism and abrogation of constitutionalism. However, one of the concessions to revolutionaries with a lasting impact was the freeing of [[peasant]]s in Austria. This facilitated [[industrialization]], as many flocked to the newly industrializing cities of the Austrian domain (in the industrial centers of [[Bohemia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]], and [[Upper Styria]]). Social upheaval led to increased strife in ethnically mixed cities, leading to mass nationalist movements.

On the foreign policy front, Austria with its non-German constituencies, was faced with a dilemma in 1848 when Germany's Constituent National Assembly (''Deutsche Konstituierende Nationalversammlung''), of which Austria was a member, stated that members could not have a state connection with non-German states, leaving Austria to decide between Germany or its Empire and Hungarian union. However these plans came to nothing for the time being, but the concept of a smaller Germany that excluded Austria (''[[Kleindeutschland]]'') was to re-emerge as the solution in 1866.  Austria's neutrality during the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856), while the emperor was preoccupied with his wedding, antagonized both sides and left Austria dangerously isolated, as subsequent events proved (Hamann 1986). 

===== The Italian question 1859 - 1860 =====
{{see also|Italian unification|Second Italian War of Independence}}
[[File:Italia1859.png|thumb|right|250px|Italy 1859. &lt;span style=&quot;color:yellow&quot;&gt;'''Yellow'''&lt;/span&gt;: Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; &lt;span style=&quot;color:brown&quot;&gt;'''Brown''' &lt;/span&gt;: Sardinia-Piedmont; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Red'''&lt;/span&gt;: Papal States; &lt;span style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;'''Green'''&lt;/span&gt;: [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], [[Parma]] and [[Modena]]; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;'''Blue'''&lt;/span&gt;: [[Lombardy-Venetia]]]]
While Austria and the Hapsburgs held hegemony over northern [[Italy]], the south was the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], with the [[Papal States]] intervening. Italy had been in a turmoil since the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, with insurrections starting in 1820 (''[[Carbonari]]''). [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] of the Two Sicilies, an absolutist monarch, sought to strengthen his position by a further dynastic alliance with Austria. He already had a connection through his second wife, [[Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of the Two Sicilies|Maria Theresa]], granddaughter of the emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] This he achieved by marrying his son, [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]], to Duchess [[Maria Sophie of Bavaria]] in February 1859. Marie was a younger sister of the Empress [[Elisabeth of Austria-Hungary|Elisabeth of Austria]], making Francis brother in law to the Emperor. Ferdinand died a few months later in May, and Francis and Maria Sophie ascended the throne. 

In the meantime Austria had fallen into a trap set by the Italian ''risorgimento''. [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]], jointly ruled with Sardinia had been the site of earlier insurrections. This time they formed a secret alliance with France (''Patto di Plombières''), whose emperor, [[Napoleon III]] was a previous ''Carbonari''. Piedmont then proceeded to provoke Vienna with a series of military manoeuvres, successfully triggering an ultimatum to [[Turin]] on April 23. its rejection was followed by an Austrian invasion, and precipitated war with France (Second Italian War of Independence 1859). Austria mistakenly expected support and received none, and the country was ill prepared for war, which went badly. The Hapsburg rulers in [[Tuscany]] and [[Modena]] were forced to flee to Vienna.         

In May 1859 Austria suffered a military defeat at the [[Battle of Varese]] and in June at [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] against the combined forces of France and Sardinia. The emperor refused to to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation which was causing great hardship at home, and took over direct command of the army, though not a professional soldier. Later that month a further defeat at [[Battle of Solférino|Solférino]] sealed Austria's fate, and the emperor found himself having to accept Napoleon's terms at [[Villafranca di Verona|Villafranca]]. Austria agreed to cede Lombardy, and the rulers of the central Italian states were to be restored. However the latter never happened, and the following year in plebiscites, all joined the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. By April 1860 [[Garibaldi]] had invaded and quickly subdued Sicily, and by February 1861 the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ceased to exist, Francis and Maria fled to Austria.

===== Aftermath - constitutional concessions =====   
These events severely weakened the emperor's position. The government's absolutist policies were unpopular and these setbacks led to domestic unrest, Hungarian secessionism, criticism of Austria's governance and allegation's of corruption. The first casualties were the emperor's ministers. The Finance Minister, [[Karl Ludwig von Bruck]] killed himself. Other casualties were [[Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol]] ([[List of foreign ministers of Austria-Hungary|Foreign Minister]]), Interior Minister [[Baron Alexander von Bach]], Police Minister [[Johann Freiherr von Kempen von Fichtenstamm]], Adjutant General [[Karl Ludwig von Grünne]], together with army generals. 

The result was a reluctant undertaking by the emperor and his chief advisor [[Agenor Gołuchowski (senior)|Goluchowski]] to return to constitutional government, culminating in the [[October Diploma]] (October 1960) establishing constitutional monarchy through a legislative assembly and provincial autonomy. This was never completely implemented due to Hungarian resistance, demanding the full autonomy lost in 1849. Consequently the October Diploma (''Oktoberdiplom'') was replaced by the [[February Patent]] (''Februarpatent''), in 1861 establishing a [[bicameral]] legislative body, the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]. The upper house (''Herrenhaus'') consisted of appointed and hereditary positions, while the lower house, the House of Deputies (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') was appointed by the provincial [[Diet (assembly)|diets]]. The ''Reichsrat'' would meet with or without the Hungarians, depending on the issues being considered. This was a first step towards the establishment of a separate Cisleithanian legislature, on the other hand the more limited role of the diets in the February Patent, compared to the October Diploma, angered the champions of regionalism. The ''Reichsrat'' was dominated by liberals, who where to be the dominant political force for the next two decades.

===== The Danish Question 1864-6 =====
[[File:Deutscher-Dualismus.gif|thumb|250px|The Prussian lion circling the Austrian elephant. [[Adolph Menzel]], 1846]]
Prussia and Denmark had already fought [[First Schleswig War|one war]] in 1848-51 over the territories that lined their common border, [[Schleswig-Holstein Question|Schleswig-Holstein]] which resulted in Denmark retaining them. By 1864 Austria was at war again, this time allying itself with Prussia against Denmark in the [[Second Schleswig War]], which although successful this time, turned out to be Austria's last military victor. The war concluded with the [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|Treaty of Vienna]] by which Denmark ceded the territories. The following year the [[Gastein Convention]] resolved the control of the new territories, [[Holstein]] being allocated to Austria, after initial conflicts between the allies. However this did little to ease [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]] over the German question. The ongoing efforts by [[Otto von Bismarck]], the Prussian Minister President, to revoke the agreement and wrest control of the territories would soon lead to all out out conflict between the two powers and achieve the desired weakening of Austria's position in central Europe.

===== The Hungarian question =====
From the 1848 revolution, in which much of the Hungarian aristocracy had participated, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Hungary]] remained restless, pressing for more autonomy, restoration of the constitution, opposing the centralism of Vienna and refusing to pay taxes (Hamann 144). Hungary had little support in the court at Vienna which was strongly Bohemian and considered the Hungarians as revolutionaries. From the loss of the Italian territories in 1859, the Hungarian question became more prominent. Hungary was negotiating with foreign powers to support it, and most significantly with [[Prussia]]. Therefore Hungary represented a threat to Austria in any opposition to Prussia within the [[German Confederation]] over the [[German question|German Question]]. Therefore cautious discussions over concessions, referred to as ''Conciliation'' by the Hungarians (Hamann 146), started to take place. Emperor Franz Joseph traveled to [[Budapest]] in June 1865 and made a few concessions, such as abolishing the military jurisdiction, and granting an amnesty to the press. However these fell far short of the demands of the Hungarian liberals whose minimal demands were restoration of the constitution and the emperor's separate coronation as King of Hungary. Chief among these were [[Gyula Andrássy]] and [[Ferenc Deák]], who endeavoured to improve their influence at the court in Vienna. (Hamann 146-147). In January 1866 a delegation of the Hungarian parliament traveled to Vienna to invite the imperial family to make an official visit to Hungary, which they did, at some length from January to March. (Hamann 150-151).

===== Austro-Prussian War 1866 =====
While Andrássy was making frequent visits to Vienna from Budapest during early 1866, relations with [[Prussia]] were deteriorating. There was talk of war. Prussia had signed a secret treaty with the relatively new [[Kingdom of Italy]] on April 8, while Austria concluded one with France on June 12, in exchange for Venetia. 

While the motives for the war, Prussian masterplan or opportunism, are disputed, the outcome was a radical re-alignment of power in Central Europe. Austria brought the continuing dispute over Holstein before the German diet and also decided to convene the Holstein diet. Prussia, declaring that the Gastein Convention had thereby been nullified, invaded Holstein. When the German diet responded by voting for a partial mobilization against Prussia, Bismarck declared that the [[German Confederation]] was ended. Thus this may be considered a Third Schleswig War.

Hostilities broke out on June 14 as the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (June - August 1866), in which Prussia and the north German states faced not only Austria but much of the rest of Germany, especially the southern states. Unfortunately for Austria, three days later Italy declared was on Austria in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Italy now being Prussia's ally. Thus Austria had to fight on two fronts. Their first engagement resulted in a minor victory against the Italians at [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]] near Verona on June 24. However on the northern front Austria suffered a major military defeat at the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] in Bohemia on July 3. Although Austria had a further victory against the Italians in a naval battle at [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Lissa]] on July 20, it was clear by then that the war was over for Austria, Prussian armies threatening Vienna itself, forcing the evacuation of the court to Budapest. Napoleon III intervened resulting in an armistice at [[Nikolsburg]] on July 21 and a peace treaty in [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Prague]] on August 23. In the meantime the Italians who had had a series of successes throughout July, and signed an [[armistice]] at [[Armistice of Cormons|Cormons]] on August 12 rather than face the remaining Austrian army freed from its northern front. 

As a result of these wars Austria had now lost all its Italian territory and was now excluded from further German affairs, that were now reorganised under [[Prussian]] dominance in the new [[North German Confederation]]. The ''[[Kleindeutschland]]'' concept had prevailed. For the Austrians in Italy, the war had been tragically pointless, since Venetia had already been ceded.

===== Conciliation =====

Andrassy was regularly in Vienna, as was Deak and the Hungarian position was backed by constitutionalists and liberals. While anti-Hungarian sentiments ran high at the court, the Emperor's position was becoming increasingly untenable, with the Prussian army now at [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava), and Vienna crammed with exiles, while hope for French intervention proved to be fruitless. The Hungarians recruited [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]] who became a strong advocate for their cause. [[György Klapka]] had organised a legion fighting for the Prussians, which Bismarck had supported, that entered Hungary and agitated for Hungarian independence. 

However the needs of the other provinces had to be considered before entering into any form of Hungarian dualism which would give Hungary special privileges, and started to fan the flames of Czech nationalism, since Slavic interests were likely to be submerged. People started to talk about the events of 1848 again. By February 1867 [[Count Richard Belcredi|Count Belcredi]] resigned as Minister President over his concerns about Slavic interests, and was succeeded by foreign minister [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust|Ferdinand Beust]], who promptly pursued the Hungarian option which had become a reality by the end of the month. 

===== ''Ausgleich'' (Compromise) 1867 =====
[[Austria-Hungary]] was created through the mechanism of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] (''Ausgleich''). Thus the Hungarians finally achieved their aims of autonomy, indeed citizenship of one half of the realm was not recognised by the other. The western half of the realm known as (Cisleithania) and the eastern Hungarian ([[Transleithania]]), that is the realms lying on each side of the [[Leitha]] [[tributary]] of the [[Danube]] river, now became two realms with different interior policy, but with a common ruler and a common foreign and military policy. The empire now had two capitals, two cabinets and two parliaments. Only three cabinet positions served both halves of the monarchy, war, foreign affairs and finance (when both sectors were involved). Costs were assigned 70:30 to Cisleithania, however the Hungarians represented a single nationality while Cisleithania included all the other kingdoms and provinces. Andrassy was appointed as the first Minister President of the new Hungary on February 17th. Feelings ran high in the provinces, and the Diets in Moravia and Bohemia were shut down in March. (Hamann 172)  

Emperor Franz Joseph made a speech from the throne in May to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|''Reichsrat'']] (Imperial Council) asking for retroactive ratification and promising further constitutional reforms and increased autonomy to the provinces. This was a major retreat from absolutism. (Hamann 173) On June 8 the Emperor and Empress were crowned [[King of Hungary|King and Queen of Hungary]] in a ceremony whose pomp and splendour seemed out of keeping with Austria's recent military and political humiliation and the extent of financial reparations. (Hamann 174ff) As part of the celebrations the emperor announced further concessions that aggravated relationships between Hungary and the rest of the monarchy. An amnesty was declared for all political offences since 1848 (including [[Klapka]] and [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]]) and reversal of the confiscation of estates. In addition the coronation Gift was directed to the families and veterans of the revolutionary Honved, which was revived as the Royal Hungarian Militia. (Hamann 178)

In return for the Liberals support of the ''Ausgleich'', concessions were made to parliamentary prerogatives in the new constitutional law. The law of 21 December 1867, although frequently amended, was the foundation of Austrian governance for the remaining 50 years of the empire, and was largely based on the February Patent, the Imperial Council and included a bill of rights. Ultimately the political balance of the dual monarchy represented a compromise between authoritarianism (''Obrigkeitsstaat'') and parliamentarianism ''([[Rechtsstaat]])'' (Hacohen 2002). Like most compromises it was rejected by extremists on both sides, including Kossuth.

===== Austria-Hungary 1867-1914 =====
1873 marked the [[Silver Jubilee]] of Franz Joseph, and provided not only an occasion for celebration but also one of reflection on the progress of the monarchy since 1848. [[Vienna]] had grown from a population of 500,000 to over a million, the walls and fortifications had been demolished and the ''Ringstrasse'' constructed with many magnificent new buildings along it. The Danube was being regulated to reduce the risk of flooding, a new aqueduct constructed to bring fresh water into the city, and many new bridges, schools, hospitals, churches and a new university built. (Hamann 211)  

'''Foreign policy'''&lt;br&gt;
What was supposed to be a temporary emergency measure was to last for half a century. Austria succeeded in staying neutral during the [[Franco Prussian War]] of 1870-1 despite those who saw an opportunity for revenge on Prussia for the events of 1866. However Austria'a allies amongst the South German States were now allied with Prussia, and it was unlikely that Austria's military capacity had significantly improved in the meantime. Any residual doubts were rapidly dispelled by the the speed of the Prussian advance and the subsequent overthrow of the [[Second Empire (France)|Second Empire]]. 

In November 1871 Austria made a radical change in foreign policy. [[Ferdinand Beust]], the First Prime Minister (to 1867), Chancellor and Foreign Minister (1866-1871) of the Dual Monarchy, was dismissed. Beust was an advocate of ''revanche'' against Prussia, but was succeeded by the Hungarian Prime Minister, the liberal [[Gyula Andrássy]] as [[List of foreign ministers of Austria-Hungary|Foreign Minister]] (1871-1879), although both opposed the federalist policies of Prime Minister [[Karl Hohenwart]] (1871) while [[Prince Adolf of Auersperg]] became the new Prime Minister (1871-1879). Andrassy's appointment caused concern amongst the conservative Court Party (''[[Kamarilla]]''), but he worked hard to restore relationships between Berlin and Vienna, culminating in the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] (''Zweibund'') of 1879.   

In 1878, [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which had been cut off from the rest of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by the creation of new states in the [[Balkans]] following the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]] and the resulting [[Congress of Berlin]] (June-July 1878). The territory was ceded to Austria-Hungary, and Andrassy prepared to occupy it. This led to a further deterioration of relations with [[Russia]] and was to lead to tragic consequences in the next century. Austrian troops encountered stiff resistance and suffered significant casualties. The occupation created controversy both within and without the empire and led to Andrassy's resignation in 1879. This territory was finally [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed in 1908]] and put under joint rule by the governments of both Austria and Hungary.

'''Economy'''&lt;br&gt;
The second half of the nineteenth century saw a lot of construction, expansion of cities and railway lines, and development of industry. During the earlier part of this period, known as ''[[Gründerzeit]]'', Austria became an industrialized country, even though the Alpine regions remained characterized by agriculture. Austria was able to celebrate its new found grandeur in the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|Vienna World Exhibition (''Weltausstellung'') of 1873]], attended by all the crowned heads of Europe, and beyond. This period of relative prosperity was followed by the [[Panic of 1873|1873 Stock market crash]].

==== Politics and governance ====

===== Liberalism in Cisleithania 1867-1879 =====
{{see also|Liberalism in Austria}}
Political parties became legitimate entities in Austria from 1848, apart from a brief lapse in the 1850s. However the structure of the legislative body created by the 1861 February Patent provided little scope for party organisation. Initial political organisation resembled the cleavages in Austrian culture. Since the time of the [[Counter-Reformation]] the [[Catholic Church]] had assumed a major role in the political life of the empire, in conjunction with the aristocracy and conservative rural elements. Allied against these forces were a more secular urban middle class, reflecting the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]] with its anti-clericism ''([[Kulturkampf]])''. Other elements on the left were German nationalism, defending [[German question|Greater German]] interests against the [[Slavs]], and found support amongst urban intelligentsia. However party structure was far from cohesive and both groupings contained factions which either supported or opposed the government of the day. These parties reflected the traditional right/left split of political vision. The left, or [[Liberalism in Austria|Liberal]] (''Deutschliberale Partei'') factions were known as the Constitutional Party (''Verfassungspartei''), but both left and right were fragmented into factions (''Klubs''). Without direct elections there was no place for constituency organisation, and affinities were intellectual not organisational. Nor, without ministerial responsibility, was there a need for such organisation. The affinities were driven by respective visions of the representative institutions. The left derived its name from its support in principle of the 1861-7 constitution and were the driving elements of the 1848 revolution, the right supported historic rights. The left drew its support from the propertied bourgeoisie (''Besitzbürgertum''), affluent professionals and the civil service. These were longstanding ideological differences (Pulzer 1969). The 1867 elections saw the Liberals take control of the lower house under [[Prince Karl of Auersperg|Karl Auersperg]] (1867-1868) and were instrumental in the adoption of the 1867 constitution and in abrogating the 1855 [[Concordat]] (1870).

Suffrage progressively improved during the period 1860-1882. The selection of deputies to the ''Reichsrat'' by provincial legislatures proved unworkable particularly once the [[Bohemia]]n diet effectively boycotted the Reichsrat in an attempt to acquire equal status with the Hungarians in a tripartite monarchy. As a result suffrage was changed to direct election to the ''Reichsrat'' in 1873.

Even then by 1873 only six percent of the adult male population were franchised (Hacohen 2002). The initial divisions into Catholic, [[Classical liberalism|liberal]], [[Nationalism|national]], [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[agrarian]] parties differed across ethnic grounds further fragmenting the political culture. However there was now emerging the presence of extra-parliamentary parties whereas previously parties were purely intra-parliamentary. This provided an opportunity for the disenfranchised to find a voice. These changes were taking place against a rapidly changing backdrop of an Austrian economy that was modernising and industrialising and economic crises such as [[Panic of 1873|that of 1873]] and its resultant [[Long Depression|depression]] (1873-1879), and the traditional parties were slow to respond to the demands of the populace. By the election of 1901, the last election under the defined classes of franchisement (''Curia'') extraparliamentary parties won 76 of the 118 seats. 

This era saw anti-liberal sentiments and declining fortunes of the Liberal party which had held power since 1867 apart from a brief spell of conservative government in 1870-1. In 1870 Liberal support for Prussia in the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] displeased the Emperor and he turned to the Conservatives to form a government under [[Count Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart]] (1871-1871). Hohenwart was the conservative leader in parliament, and the Emperor believed his more sympathetic views to Slavic aspirations and federalism would weaken the Austro-German Liberals. Hohenwart appointed [[Albert Schäffle]] as his commerce minister and drew up a policy known as the [[Fundamental Articles of 1871]] (''Fundamentalartikel''). The policy failed, the Emperor withdrew his support and the Liberals regained power. 

The Liberal party became progressively unliberal and more nationalistic, and against whose social conservatism the progressive intellectuals would rebel (Hacohen 2002). During their 1870-1 opposition they blocked attempts to extend the dual monarchy to a tripartite monarchy including the Czechs, and promoted the concept of ''Deutschtum'' (the granting of all rights of citizenship to those who displayed the characteristics of the solid German ''Bürger''). They also opposed the extension of suffrage because restricted suffrage favoured their electoral base (Hacohen 2002). In 1873 the party fragmented, with a radical faction of the Constitutional Party forming the Progressive Club (''Fortschrittsklub''), while a right-wing faction formed the conservative Constitutionalist Landlordism (''Verfassungstreue Grossgrundbesitz'') leaving a rump of 'Old Liberals' (''Altliberale''). The result was a proliferation of German Liberal (''Deutschfreiheitlichkeit'') and [[German nationalism in Austria|German National]] (''Deutschnationalismus'') groups.

===== Political realignment 1879 =====
While Liberal achievements had included economic modernisation, expanding secular education and rebuilding the fabric and culture of Vienna, while collaborating with the Administration ''([[Verwaltung]])'', after 1873 a progressive series of schisms and mergers continued to weaken the party which effectively disappeared by 1911. 

The Liberal cabinet of [[Prince Adolf of Auersperg|Adolf Auersperg]] (1871-1879) was dismissed in 1879 over its opposition to [[Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary|Foreign Minister]] [[Gyula Andrássy]]'s (1871-1879) Balkan policy and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|annexation of Bosnia-Herzogovina]], which would have added more Slavs and further diluted German nationalism and identity (''Staatsnation''). In the ensuing elections the [[Liberalism in Austria|Liberals]] lost control of parliament and went into opposition, the incoming government under [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Edward Taaffe]] (1879-1893) basically consisting of a group of factions, the &quot;Iron Ring&quot; (''Der eiserne Ring''), united in a determination to keep the Liberals out of power. However the latter [[filibustered]] leading the government to seek electoral reform as a strategy to weaken their position, which was enacted in 1882. Despite this, the coalition, nominally conservative and committed to anti-socialism passed a series of social reforms over the decade 1880-1890, following the examples of Germany and Switzerland. These were reforms which the Liberals had been unable to get past a government strongly tied to the concept of individual's rights to self-determination free from government interference (Grandner 1997). Such measures had the support of both the Liberals, now the United Left (''Vereinigte Linke'' 1881) and the German National Party (''Deutsche Nationalpartei'' 1891), an offshoot of the [[German nationalism in Austria|German National Movement]] (''Deutschnationale Bewegung''). The electoral reforms of 1882 were the most influential in that it enfranchised proportionally more Germans. 

Social reform now moved to become a platform of conservative Catholics like [[Prince Aloys Franz de Paula Maria|Prince Aloys de Paula Maria of Liechtenstein]], [[Karl Freiherr von Vogelsang|Baron Karl von Vogelsang]], and Count Egbert Belcredi (Boyer 1995). The era of electoral reform saw the emergence of [[Georg von Schonerer]]’s [[Linz Program of 1882|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutsche Vereinigung'') (1882), appealing to an anti-clerical middle class, and Catholic social reformers such as L. Psenner and A. Latschka created the Christian Social Association (''Christlich-Sozialer Verein'') (1887). Around the same time F. Piffl, F. Stauracz, Ae. Schoepfer, A. Opitz, [[Karl Lueger]] and Prince Aloys Liechtenstein formed the United Christians (''Vereinigten Christen'') to advocate Christian social reform. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://austria-lexikon.at/af/AEIOU/Christlichsoziale_Bewegung Austria-Forum: Christlichsoziale Bewegung]&lt;/ref&gt;
These two organisations merged in 1891 under Karl Lueger to form the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Socialist Party]] (''Christlichsoziale Partei'', CS).   

However the Taaffe government's policy of ethnic inclusiveness fuelled nationalism amongst the German speaking population. The Liberals had maintained the strong centralism of the absolutist era (with the exception of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in 1867) while the Conservatives attempted a more federalist state that ultimately led to the fall of the Taaffe government in 1893, including a second attempt at Bohemian ''Ausgleich'' (Tripartite monarchy) in 1890 (Grandner 1997). 
&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Hantsch, Die Nationalitaetenfrage im alten Oesterreich. Das Problem der konstruktiven Reichsgestaltung (in Wiener Historische Studien 1, Vienna 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left the spread of anarchical ideas and oppressive government saw the emergence of a Marxist [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (''Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs'', SDAPÖ) in 1889 which succeeded in winning seats in the 1897 elections which followed further extension of suffrage in 1896 to include peasants and the working classes.

===== Universal male suffrage 1907 =====
[[File:2007 Austria 5 Euro 100 Years Universal Male Suffrage back.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2007 coinage|2007 Austrian coin depicting 100 Years of Universal Male Suffrage]], showing Parliament in 1907]]
The [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1907|universal male suffrage introduced in 1907]] by Minister-President [[Baron Max Wladimir von Beck|Freiherr von Beck]] changed the balance of power, formally tilted towards German Austrians, and revealed that they were now a minority in a predominantly Slavic empire. In the 1900 census, Germans were 36% of the Cisleithanian population but the largest single group, but never acted as a cohesive group (nor did any other national group), although they were the dominant group in the political life of the monarchy. Germans were followed by Czechs and Slovaks (23%), Poles (17), Ruthenians (13), Slovenes (5), Serbo-Croats (3), Italians (3) and Romanians 1%. However these national groups, especially the Germans were often scattered geographically. The Germans also dominated economically, and in level of education.   

The post reform 1907 parliament (''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'') was elected along national lines, with only the Christian-Social and Social Democrat parties predominantly German. However Austria was governed by the Emperor who appointed the Imperial Council of Ministers (''Ministerrat''), who in turn answered to him, parliament being left free to criticise government policy. Technically it had the power to legislate from 1907, but in practice the Imperial government generated its own legislation, and the Emperor could veto his own minister's bills. The major parties were divided geographically and socially, with the social democrats base being the towns, predominantly Vienna, and having a very different perspective to the devout but illiterate peasantry in the countryside. The latter were joined by the aristocracy and bourgeoisie in supporting the ''status quo'' of the monarchy.   

The [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1911|1911 elections]] elected a parliament that would carry Austria through the war and the end of the empire in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Modern History xii 476&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pech 1989&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the effectiveness of parliamentarism was hampered by conflicts between parties representing different ethnic groups, and meetings of the parliament ceased altogether during [[World War I]].

[[File:Secession Vienna June 2006 017.jpg|thumb|The [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]], Vienna, built in 1897 by [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] for exhibitions of the Secession group]]
The initial years of the nineteenth century following the [[Congress of Vienna]], up till the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848]] was characterised by the [[Biedermeier]] period of design and architecture, partly fuelled by the repressive domestic scene that diverted attention to domesticity and the arts. 

With the reign of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] (1848-1916) came a new era of grandeur, typified by the [[Belle Époque]] style, with extensive building and the construction of the [[Ringstrasse]] in Vienna with its monumental buildings (officially opened May 1 1865, after seven years). Architects of the period included [[Heinrich Ferstel]] ([[Votivkirche]], [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien]]), [[Friedrich von Schmidt]] ([[Rathaus, Vienna|Rathaus]]), [[Theophil Hansen]] ([[Austrian Parliament Building|Parliament]]), [[Gottfried Semper]] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Burgtheater]]), [[Eduard van der Nüll]] ([[Vienna State Opera|Opera]]) and [[August Sicard von Sicardsburg|August Sicardsburg]] (Opera). 

1897 saw the resignation of a group of artists from the Association of Austrian Artists (''[[Vienna Künstlerhaus|Gesellschaft bildender Künstler Österreichs]]''), headed by [[Gustav Klimt]] who became the first president of this group which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]] or  Wiener Secession (''Vereinigung Bildender Künstler Österreichs''). The movement was a protest against the [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] and conservatism of the former organisation, following similar movements in [[Berlin Secession|Berlin]] and [[Munich Secession|Munich]]. Partly this was a revolt against the perceived excesses of the earlier ''[[Ringstrasse]]'' era, and a yearning to return to the relative simplicity of Biedermaier. From this group [[Josef Hoffman]] and [[Koloman Moser]] formed the Vienna Arts and Crafts Workshop (''[[Wiener Werkstätte]]'') in 1903 to promote the development of [[applied arts]]. The Secession became associated with a specific building, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]] (''Wiener Secessionsgebäude'') built in 1897 and which housed their exhibitions, starting in 1898. The Secession as originally conceived splintered in 1905 when Klimt and others left over irreconcilable differences. The group however lasted till 1939 and the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].

Architecturally this was the era of [[Jugendstil]] (Art Nouveau) and the contrasting work of men like [[Otto Wagner]] ([[Kirche am Steinhof|Kirche am Steinho]]f) known for embellishment and [[Adolf Loos]], who represented restraint. Art Nouveau and the modern style came relatively late to Austria, around 1900, and was distinguishable from the earlier movement in other European capitals.

One of the prominent literary figures was [[Karl Kraus]], the essayist and satirist, known for his newspaper &quot;The Torch&quot; (''Die Fackel''), founded in 1899.

On the musical scene, [[Johann Strauss I|Johan Strauss]] and his family dominated the Viennese scene over the entire period, which also produced [[Franz Schubert]], [[Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Brahms|Johannes Brahms]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] amongst others. 

By the opening years of the twentieth century ([[Fin de siècle]]) the [[avant garde]] were beginning to challenge traditional values, often shocking Viennese society, such as [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s play ''[[La Ronde (play)|Reigen]]'', the paintings of Klimt, and the music of Schoenberg, [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]] and the [[Second Viennese School]] (''Zweite Wiener Schule'').

[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-22.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Austro-Hungarian]] [[POW|prisoners of war]] in [[Russia]], 1915]]
Nationalist strife increased during the decades until 1914. The assassination of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], who was the presumed heir of Franz Joseph as Emperor, in [[Sarajevo]] by a [[Serb]] nationalist group helped to trigger [[World War I]]. In November 1916 the Emperor dies, leaving the relatively inexperienced [[Karl of Austria|Charles (Karl)]] in command. The defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in 1918 resulted in the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, and the Emperor went into exile.

==German Austria and the First Republic (1918&amp;ndash;1933)==

=== Republic of German-Austria 1918-1919 ===
{{main|German Austria}}

==== 1918 ====
The First World War effectively ended for Austria (technically Austria-Hungary, but [[Hungary]] had withdrawn on October 31, 1918, and most other states within the empire, e.g., Czechoslovakia, and [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|South Slavs]], had already withdrawn) on November 3, 1918, when the defeated army signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] at [[Padua]] following the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]]. Austria was forced to cede all territory occupied since 1914, and in addition a considerable amount of other territory and the allies were given access to Austria. The empire was thus dissolved. 

[[File:Karl Renner 1905.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Renner]] in 1905, [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] 12 November 1918-7 July 1920, President of the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] 1931-1933]]
The Provisional National Assembly (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich'') met in Vienna from 21 October 1918 to 19 February 1919, as the first parliament of the new Austria, in the [[Lower Austria]] parliamentary buildings (''[[Niederösterreichische Landhaus]]''). It consisted of those members of the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|''Reichsrat'']] (Imperial Council) elected in 1911 from German speaking territories with three presidents, Franz Dinghofer ([[German National Movement (Austria)|German National Movement]], GDVP), Jodok Fink ([[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], CS) and [[Karl Seitz]] ([[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]], SDAPÖ). The National Assembly continued its work till 16 February 1919 when elections were held. On 30 October it adopted a provisional constitution and on November 12 it adopted [[German Austria]] (''Deutschösterreich'') as the name of the new state. Since the Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I (Karl I)]] had stated on November 11 that he no longer had &quot;''auf jeden Anteil an den Staatsgeschäften''&quot; (any share in the affairs of state), although he always said that he never abdicated. Austria was now a republic. 

[[File:Der Aufbau der Republik Deutschösterreich.png|thumb|Territorial claims of Austria 1918/19]]
However the provisional constitution stated that it was to be part of the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]] proclaimed three days earlier. Article 2 stated: ''Deutschösterreich ist ein Bestandteil der Deutschen Republik'' (German Austria is part of the German Republic). 

[[Karl Renner]] was proclaimed [[Chancellor of Austria]], succeeding [[Heinrich Lammasch]] and led the first three [[List of Chancellors of Austria|cabinets]] (12 November 1918-7 July 1920) as a grand coalition of the SDAPÖ, CS, and GDVP. The latter was composed of a large number of splinter groups of the German National and German Liberal movements, and were numerically the largest group in the assembly.  

On November 22 Austria also unsuccessfully laid claim to all the former German speaking territories of the former Hapsburg Empire in [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[German Bohemia|German Bohemia and parts of Moravia]]), [[Poland]] ([[Austrian Silesia]]) and the [[South Tyrol]], annexed by [[Italy]]. However Austria was in no position to enforce its claims against either the victorious allies or the new nation states that emerged from the dissolution of empire.

==== 1919 ====
On [[Austrian Constitutional Assembly election, 1919|19 February elections]] were held for what was now called the Constituent National Assembly (''Konstituierende Nationalversammlung''). Although the Social Democrats won the most seats (41%) they did not have an absolute majority and formed a [[grand coalition]] with the second largest party, the Christian Socialists. On 12 March the National Assembly declared &quot;German Austria&quot; to the part of the &quot;German Republic&quot;. 

Thus, in the [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the war]] the Empire was broken up based loosely on national grounds. In the words of the then French Prime Minister, [[Georges Clemenceau]] - ''Ce qui reste, c'est l'Austriche'' (The rest is Austria). Austria, with its modern borders, was created out of the main German speaking areas. From an Empire of 50 million people it was reduced to a country with a population of 6.5 million.

Large sections of the population and most representatives of political parties were of the opinion that this &quot;residual&quot; or &quot;[[rump state]]&quot; - without its previous Hungarian agricultural sector and Bohemian industry would not be economically viable. The journalist [[Hellmut Andics]] (1922-1998) expressed this sentiment in his book entitled ''Der Staat, den keiner wollte'' (The state that nobody wanted) in 1962.

Austria's exact future remained uncertain till formal treaties were signed and ratified. This process began with the opening of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference in Paris]] on 18 January 1919 and culminated in the signing of the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] on 10 September that year, although the National Assembly initially rejected the draft treaty on 7 June.

=== The First Republic 1919-1933 ===
{{main|First Austrian Republic}}

==== Treaty of Saint Germain 1919 ====
The fledgling Republic of German-Austria was to prove short lived. The proposed merger with the German Empire (Weimar Republic) was vetoed by the Allied victors in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]-en-Laye (10 September 1919) under Article 88 which prohibited economic or political union. The allies were fearful of the long held ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' dream - a union of all German speaking populations. The treaty was ratified by parliament on 21 October 1919. Austria was to remain independent, and was obliged to be so for at least 20 years. 

The treaty also obliged the country to change its name from the &quot;Republic of German Austria&quot; to the &quot;Republic of Austria&quot;  (''Republik Österreich''), i.e., the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]], a name that persists to this day. The German-speaking bordering areas of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] (later called the &quot;[[Sudetenland]]&quot;) were allocated to the newly founded [[Czechoslovakia]]. Many Austrians and Germans regarded this as hypocrisy since U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had proclaimed in his famous &quot;[[Fourteen Points]]&quot; the &quot;right of self-determination&quot; for all nations. In Germany, the constitution of the [[Weimar constitution|Weimar Republic]] explicitly stated this in article 61: ''Deutschösterreich erhält nach seinem Anschluß an das Deutsche Reich das Recht der Teilnahme am Reichsrat mit der seiner Bevölkerung entsprechenden Stimmenzahl. Bis dahin haben die Vertreter Deutschösterreichs beratende Stimme.'' - &quot;German Austria has the right to participate in the [[Reichsrat (Germany)|German Reichsrat]] (the constitutional representation of the federal German states) with a consulting role according to its number of inhabitants until unification with Germany&quot;. In Austria itself, almost all political parties together with the majority of public opinion continued to cling to the concept of unification laid out in Article 2 of the 1918 constitution.&lt;ref name=dow/&gt;

Although Austria-Hungary had been one of the Central Powers, the allied victors were much more lenient with a defeated Austria than either Germany or Hungary. Representatives of the new Republic of Austria convinced them that it was unfair to penalize Austria for the actions of a now dissolved Empire, especially as other areas of the Empire were now perceived to be on the &quot;victorious&quot; side, simply because they had renounced the Empire at the end of the war. Austria never did have to pay reparations because allied commissions determined that the country could not afford to pay. 

However, the Treaty of Saint Germain also meant that Austria lost significant German-speaking territories, in particular the southern part of the [[County of Tyrol]] (now [[South Tyrol]]) to Italy and the German-speaking areas within [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] to [[Czechoslovakia]].

==== End of grand coalition and new constitution 1920-1933 ====
The grand coalition was dissolved on 10 June 1920, being replaced by a CS- SDAPÖ coalition under [[Michael Mayr]] as Chancellor (7 July 1920-21 June 1921), necessitating [[Austrian legislative election, 1920|new elections which were held on 17 October]], for what now became the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] (''Nationalrat''), under the new [[Constitution of Austria|constitution]] of 1 October. This resulted in the Christian Socialists now emerging as the strongest party, with 42% of the votes and subsequently forming Mayr's second government on 22 October as a CS minority government (with the support of the GDVP) without the Social Democrats. The CS were to continue in power till end of the first republic, in various combinations of coalitions with the GDVP and [[Landbund]] (founded 1919). 

The borders continued to be somewhat uncertain because of plebiscites in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson. Plebiscites in the regions of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg]] between 1919–21 (Tyrol 24 April 1921, Salzburg 29 May 1921) yielded majorities of 98 and 99% in favour of a unification with Germany, fearing that small Austria was not economically viable. However such mergers were not possible under the treaty. 

On 20 October 1920, a plebiscite in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] was held in which the population chose to remain a part of Austria, rejecting the territorial claims of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to the state. The German-speaking parts of western Hungary, now christened [[Burgenland]], joined Austria as a new [[States of Austria|state]] in 1921, with the exception of the city of [[Sopron]], whose population decided in a referendum (which is sometimes considered by Austrians to have been rigged) to remain with Hungary. The area had been discussed as the site of a [[Czech Corridor|Slavic corridor]] uniting Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia. This made Austria the only defeated country to acquire additional territory as part of border adjustments. 

[[File:1P049-1919-1 Krone.jpg|thumb|left|Hyper inflation led to a change of currency from the old ''[[Austro-Hungarian krone|Krone]]'' (here marked as German-Austrian) to the new ''[[Austrian Schilling|Schilling]]'' in 1925]]
Despite the absence of reparations, Austria under the coalition suffered [[hyperinflation]] similar to that of Germany, destroying some of the financial assets of the middle and upper classes, and disrupting the economy.  Adam Ferguson attributes hyperinflation to the existence of far too many people on the government payroll, failure to tax the working class, and numerous money losing government enterprises.  The fascists blamed the left for the hyperinflation; Ferguson blames policies associated with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Ferguson, ''When Money Dies: Lessons from the Great German Hyperinflation of 1923''. pages 56-62&lt;/ref&gt; Massive riots ensued in Vienna in which the rioters demanded higher taxes on the rich and reduced subsidies to the poor.  In response to the riots, the government increased taxes but failed to reduce subsidies.

The terms of the Treaty of Saint Germain were further underlined by the Geneva Protocols of the [[League of Nations]] (which Austria joined on 16 December 1920) on 4 October 1922 between Austria and the Allies. Austria was given a guarantee of sovereignty provided it did not unite with Germany over the following 20 years. Austria also received a loan of 650 million Goldkronen which was successful in halting hyperinflation, but required major restructuring of the Austrian economy. The Goldkrone was replaced by the more stable Schilling, but resulted in unemployment and new taxes, loss of social benefits and major attrition of the public service.&lt;ref name=dow&gt;[http://en.doew.braintrust.at/doew.html The Documentation Center of Austrian Resistance (DÖW)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and government ===
Emerging from the war, Austria had two main political parties on the right and one on the left. The right was split between clericalism and nationalism. The [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Socialist Party]], (''Christlichsoziale Partei'', CS), had been founded in 1891 and achieved [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] from [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1907|1907]]-[[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1911|1911]] before losing it to the socialists. Their influence had been waning in the capital, even before 1914, but became the dominant party of the First Republic, and the party of government from 1920 onwards. The CS had close ties to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was headed by a Catholic priest named [[Ignaz Seipel]] (1876–1932), who served twice as [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] (1922–1924 and 1926–1929). While in power, Seipel was working for an alliance between wealthy industrialists and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The CS drew its political support from conservative rural Catholics. In 1920 the [[Greater German People's Party]] (''Großdeutsche Volkspartei'', GDVP) was founded from the bulk of liberal and national groups and became the junior partner of the CS. 

On the left the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]] (''Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs'', SDAPÖ) founded in 1898, which pursued a fairly left-wing course known as [[Austromarxism]] at that time, could count on a secure majority in &quot;[[Red Vienna]]&quot; (as the capital was known from 1918-1934), while right-wing parties controlled all other states. The SDAPÖ were the strongest voting bloc from 1911-1918. 

Between 1918 and 1920, there was a [[grand coalition]] government including both left and right-wing parties, the CS and the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (''Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs'', SDAPÖ). This gave the Social Democrats their first opportunity to influence Austrian politics. The coalition   enacted progressive socio-economic and labour legislation such as the vote for women on 27 November 1918, but collapsed on 22 October 1920. In 1920, the modern [[Constitution of Austria]] was enacted, but from 1920 onwards Austrian politics were characterized by intense and sometimes violent conflict between left and right. The bourgeois parties maintained their dominance but formed unstable governments while socialists remained the largest elected party numerically. 

Both right-wing and left-wing [[paramilitary]] forces were created during the 20s. The ''[[Heimwehr]]'' (Home Resistance) first appeared on 12 May 1920 and became progressively organised over the next three years and the ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'' was formed in response to this on 19 February 1923. From 2 April 1923 to 30 September there were violent clashes between Socialists and Nazis in Vienna. That on 2 April, referred to as ''Schlacht auf dem Exelberg'' (Battle of Exelberg), involved 300 Nazis against 90 Socialists (Steininger 2008). Further episodes occurred on 4 May and 30 September 1923. A clash between those groups in [[Schattendorf]], [[Burgenland]], on 30 January 1927 led to the death of a man and a child. Right-wing [[veteran]]s were indicted at a court in Vienna, but acquitted in a [[jury trial]]. This led to massive protests and a fire at the ''[[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Justizpalast]]'' in Vienna. In the [[July Revolt of 1927]], 89 protesters were killed by the Austrian police forces.

Political conflict escalated until the early 1930s. The [[Austrian legislative election, 1930|elections of 1930]] which returned the Social Democrats as the largest bloc turned out to be the last till after World War II. On May 20, 1932 [[Engelbert Dollfuß]] Christian Social Party Agriculture Minister became [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]], with a majority of one.

==== 1933: Dissolution of parliament and the formation of the Patriotic Front ====
{{Main|Austrofascism}}
Dollfuss and the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], moved Austria rapidly towards centralized power in the [[Fascist]] model. 
He was concerned that [[NSDAP|German National Socialist]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] had become [[Chancellor of Germany]] on January 30, 1933, after his party had become the largest group in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]] and was quickly assuming absolute power. Similarly the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] (DNSAP) could easily become a significant minority in future Austrian elections. Fascism scholar [[Stanley G. Payne]], estimated that if elections had been held in 1933, the DNSAP could have secured about 25% of the votes. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] suggested an even higher level of support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region bordering Nazi Germany.

The events in Austria during March 1933 echoed those of [[Germany]], where Hitler also effectively installed himself as dictator in the same month.

===== March coup d'etat =====
On March 4, 1933 there occurred an irregularity in the parliamentary voting procedures. [[Karl Renner]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Austria]], ''Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs'' SPÖ), president of the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] (''Nationalrat'': lower house of parliament) resigned in order to be able to cast a vote on a controversial proposal to deal with the railroad strike that was likely to pass by a very margin, which he was not able to do while holding that office. Consequently the two vice-presidents representing the other parties, [[Rudolf Ramek]] (Christian Social Party) and [[Sepp Straffner]] ([[Greater German People's Party]]) also resigned for the same reason. In the absence of the President the session could not be concluded. 

Although there were procedural rules which could have been followed in this unprecedented and unforeseen event, the [[Dolfuss]] cabinet seized the opportunity to declare the parliament unable to function. While Dolfuss described this event as &quot;self-elimination of Parliament&quot; (''Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments'') it was actually the beginning of a [[coup d'etat]] that would establish the &quot;[[Federal State of Austria|Ständestaat]]&quot; ([[Austrofascism]], ''Austrofaschismus'') lasting to 1938.

Using an emergency provision enacted during the [[First World War]], the Economic War Powers Act (''Kriegswirtschaftliches Ermächtigungsgesetz'', KWEG 24. Juli 1917 RGBl.
&lt;ref&gt;''Reichsgesetzblatt'' Gazette of laws and regulations&lt;/ref&gt;
Nr. 307) the executive assumed legislative power on March 7 and advised President Wilhelm Miklas to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. The [[First Republic of Austria|First Republic]] and democratic government therefore effectively ended in Austria, leaving Dollfuss to govern as a dictator with absolute powers. Immediate measures included removing the right of public assembly and freedom of the press. The opposition accused him of violating the constitution.

&lt;ref&gt;Lucas Prakke and Constantijn Kortmann, eds., Constitutional Law of 15 EU Member States (Kluwer, 2004) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt by the Greater German People's Party and the Social Democrats to reconvene the Council on March 15 was prevented by barring the entrance with police and advising [[President of Austria|President]] [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to adjourn it indefinitely. Dollfuss would have been aware that [[Nazi]] troops had seized power in neighbouring [[Bavaria]] on March 9. Finally, on March 31, the [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]] (paramilitary arm of the Social Democratic Party) was dissolved (but continued illegally).

===== Subsequent events =====
Dolfuss then met with [[Benito Mussolini]] for the first time in [[Rome]] on April 13. On the 23rd, the National Socialists (DNSAP) gained 40 per cent of the vote in the [[Innsbruck]] communal elections, becoming the largest voting bloc, so in May all State and Communal elections were banned.   

On May 20, 1933, Dollfuss replaced the &quot;Democratic Republic&quot; with a new entity, merging his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the [[Heimwehr]], which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party, to form the ''[[Patriotic Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]]'' (''Vaterländische Front''), though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss' successor [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal ''Frontmiliz'' as a paramilitary task force. The new entity was allegedly bipartisan and represented those who were &quot;loyal to the government&quot;.

The DNSAP was banned in June 1933. Dollfuss was also aware of the Soviet Union's increasing influence in Europe throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, and also banned the communists, establishing a one-party Austrofascist dictatorship largely modeled after Italian fascism, tied to [[Catholic]] [[corporatism]] and [[clericalism|anti-secularism]].  He dropped all pretence of Austrian reunification with Germany so long as the Nazi Party remained in power there. 

Although all Austrian parties, including the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAPÖ) were banned, Social Democrats continued to exist as an independent organization, including its paramilitary ''Republikaner Schutzbund'', which could muster tens of thousands against Dollfuss' government. 

In August 1933, Mussolini's government issued a guarantee of Austrian independence (&quot;if necessary, Italy would defend Austria’s independence by force of arms&quot;). Dollfuss also exchanged 'Secret Letters' with Benito Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini was interested in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the regimes of Hitler in Germany and [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter [[totalitarian]] national socialism and communism in Europe.

Dollfuss escaped an assassination attempt in October 1933 by [[Rudolf Dertill]], a 22-year old who had been ejected from the military for his national socialist views.

==== 1934: Civil war and assassination ====
{{main|Austrian Civil War}}
Despite the [[putsch]], the SPÖ continued to seek a peaceful resolution but the new [[Austrofascist]] regime ordered the headquarters of the party to be searched on 12 February 1934, provoking the Austrian Civil War, in which the weakened party and its supporters were quickly defeated and the party and its various ancillary organisations were banned.  

On 1 May 1934, the Dollfuss cabinet approved a new constitution that abolished freedom of the press, established one party system and created a total state monopoly on employer-employee relations. This system remained in force until Austria became part of the [[Third Reich]] in 1938. The Patriotic Front government frustrated the ambitions of pro-Hitlerite sympathizers in Austria who wished both political influence and unification with Germany, leading to the assassination of Dollfuss on 25 July 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/ad-harvey/austria%E2%80%99s-diminutive-dictator-engelbert-dollfuss History Today: Austria’s Diminutive Dictator: Engelbert Dollfuss. Volume: 59 Issue: 7  ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kurt Schuschnigg (1934-1938) ===
His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] maintained the ban on pro-Hitlerite activities in Austria, but was forced to resign on 11 March 1938 following a demand by [[Adolf Hitler]] for power-sharing with pro-German circles. Following Schuschnigg's resignation, German troops occupied Austria with no resistance.

== Anschluss and unification with Germany (1938&amp;ndash;1945)==
{{Main|Anschluss|Nazi Germany}}

Although the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] had explicitly forbidden the unification of Austria and Germany, the native [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was vastly striving to annex Austria during the late 1930s, which was fiercely resisted by the Austrian [[Kurt Schuschnigg|Schuschnigg]] dictatorship. When the conflict was escalating in early 1938, Chancellor Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on the issue on March 9, which was to take place on 13 March. On 12 March, ''[[Anschluss|German troops entered Austria]]'', who met celebrating crowds, in order to install Nazi puppet [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] as Chancellor. With a Nazi administration already in place and the country integrated into the Third Reich as so-called [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]], a referendum on 10 April approved of the annexation with a majority of 99.73%.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Bernbaum, ''Nazi control in Austria: the creation of the Ostmark, 1938- 1940'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Austria ceased to exist as an independent country. This annexation was enforced by military invasion but large parts of the Austrian population were in favour of the Nazi regime, many Austrians  participated in its crimes. The Jews, Communists, Socialist and hostile politicians were sent to concentration camps, murdered or forced into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Bukey, ''Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938-1945'' (2002) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the end of the war, on 28 March 1945, American troops set foot on Austrian soil and the Soviet Union's Red Army crossed the eastern border two days later, taking Vienna on 13 April. American and British forces occupied the western and southern regions, preventing Soviet forces from completely overrunning and controlling the country.

==The Second Republic (since 1945)==

===Allied occupation===
[[File:Austria 1945-55.svg|thumb|right|250px|Occupation zones in Austria]]
{{Main|Allied-administered Austria}}

In April 1945 [[Karl Renner]], an Austrian elder statesman, declared Austria separate from Germany and set up a government which included socialists, conservatives and communists. A significant number of these were returning from exile or Nazi detention, having thus played no role in the Nazi government. This contributed to the Allies treating Austria more as a liberated, rather than defeated, country, and the government was recognized by the Allies later that year. The country was occupied by the Allies from 9 May 1945 and under the [[Allied_Commission#Austria|Allied Commission for Austria]] established by an agreement on 4 July 1945, it was divided into Zones occupied respectively by American, British, French and Soviet Army personnel, with Vienna being also divided similarly into four sectors—with an International Zone at its heart.

Though under occupation, this Austrian government was officially permitted to conduct foreign relations with the approval of the Four Occupying Powers under the agreement of 28 June 1946. As part of this trend, Austria was one of the founding members of the Danube Commission formed on 18 August 1948. Austria would benefit from the [[Marshall Plan]] but economic recovery was slow.

Unlike the First Republic, which had been characterized by sometimes violent conflict between the different political groups, the [[Austrian Second Republic|Second Republic]] became a stable democracy. The two largest leading parties, the Christian-conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) remained in a coalition led by the ÖVP until 1966. The [[Communist Party of Austria]] (KPÖ), who had hardly any support in the Austrian electorate{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, remained in the coalition until 1950 and in parliament until [[Austria legislative election, 1959|1959]]. For much of the Second Republic, the only opposition party was the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), which included [[German nationalism in Austria|German national]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] political currents. It was founded in 1955 as a successor organisation to the short-lived [[Federation of Independents]] (VdU).

The United States, although only one of the four occupying powers, had the resources and the intention of restructuring Austrian popular culture. In journalism, for example, it sent in hundreds of experts (and controlled the newsprint), closed down the old party-line newspapers, introduced advertising and wire services, and trained reporters and editors, as well as production workers.  It founded the ''Wiener Kurier,'' which became popular, as well as many magazines such as ''Medical News from the United States,'' which informed doctors on new treatments and drugs.  The Americans also thoroughly revamped the radio stations, in part with the goal of countering the Soviet-controlled stations. On an even larger scale the education system was  modernized and democratized by American experts.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Wagnleitner, ''Coca-Colonization and the Cold War: The Cultural Mission of the United States in Austria After the Second World War'' (1994) pp 84-127, 150-65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence and political development during the Second Republic===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1statetreaty.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Austrian State Treaty is shown to the public in 1955]] --&gt;

The two major parties strove towards ending allied occupation and restoring a fully independent Austria. The [[Austrian State Treaty]] was signed on 15 May 1955. Upon the termination of allied occupation, Austria was [[Declaration of Neutrality|proclaimed]] a [[neutral country]], and &quot;everlasting&quot; neutrality was incorporated into the [[Constitution of Austria|Constitution]] on 26 October 1955.

The political system of the Second Republic came to be characterized by the system of ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that posts of some political importance were split evenly between members of the SPÖ and ÖVP. Interest group representations with mandatory membership (e.g., for workers, businesspeople, farmers etc.) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus. The Proporz and consensus systems largely held even during the years between 1966 and 1983, when there were non-coalition governments.

The ÖVP-SPÖ coalition ended in [[Austria legislative election, 1966|1966]], when the ÖVP gained a majority in parliament. However, it lost it in [[Austria legislative election, 1970|1970]], when SPÖ leader [[Bruno Kreisky]] formed a [[minority government]] tolerated by the FPÖ. In the [[Austria legislative election, 1971|elections of 1971]], [[Austria legislative election, 1975|1975]] and [[Austria legislative election, 1979|1979]] he obtained an absolute majority. The 70s were then seen as a time of liberal reforms in [[social policy]]. Today, the economic policies of the Kreisky era are often criticized, as the accumulation of a large [[national debt]] began, and non-profitable [[nationalized industries]] were strongly subsidized.

Following severe losses in the [[Austria legislative election, 1983|1983 elections]], the SPÖ entered into a coalition with the FPÖ under the leadership of [[Fred Sinowatz]]. In Spring 1986, [[Kurt Waldheim]] was [[Austrian presidential election, 1986|elected]] [[President of Austria|president]] amid considerable national and international protest because of his possible involvement with the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[war crimes]] during [[World War II]]. [[Fred Sinowatz]] resigned, and [[Franz Vranitzky]] became chancellor.

In September 1986, in a confrontation between the German-national and liberal wings, [[Jörg Haider]] became leader of the FPÖ.  Chancellor Vranitzky rescinded the coalition pact between FPÖ and SPÖ, and after [[Austria legislative election, 1986|new elections]], entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, which was then led by [[Alois Mock]]. Jörg Haider's populism and criticism of the [[Proporz]] system allowed him to gradually expand his party's support in elections, rising from 4% in 1983 to 27% in [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999]]. The [[Austrian Green Party|Green Party]] managed to establish itself in parliament from 1986 onwards.

===Recent years===
The SPÖ–ÖVP coalition persisted until 1999. Austria joined the [[European Union]] in 1995 ([http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.film.data.film/o254a.mpg Video of the signing in 1994]), and Austria was set on the track towards joining the [[Euro]]zone, when it was established in 1999.

In 1993, the [[Liberal Forum]] was founded by dissidents from the FPÖ. It managed to remain in parliament until 1999.
[[Viktor Klima]] succeeded Vranitzky as chancellor in 1997.

In 1999, the ÖVP fell back to third place behind the FPÖ in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|elections]]. Even though ÖVP chairman and [[Vice Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] had announced that his party would go into opposition in that case, he entered into a coalition with the FPÖ &amp;ndash; with himself as chancellor &amp;ndash; in early 2000 under considerable national and international protest. [[Jörg Haider]] resigned as FPÖ chairman, but retained his post as [[Landeshauptmann|governor]] of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and kept substantial influence within the FPÖ.

In 2002, disputes within the FPÖ resulting from losses in state elections caused the [[Knittelfeld Putsch|resignation of several FPÖ government members]] and a collapse of the government. Wolfgang Schüssel's ÖVP emerged as the winner of the [[Austria legislative election, 2002|subsequent election]], ending up in first place for the first time since 1966. The FPÖ lost more than half of its voters, but reentered the coalition with the ÖVP. Despite the new coalition, the voter support for the FPÖ continued to dwindle in all most all local and state elections. Disputes between &quot;nationalist&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; wings of the party resulted in a split, with the founding of a new liberal party called the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) and led by Jörg Haider.  Since all FPÖ government members and most FPÖ members of parliament decided to join the new party, the Schüssel coalition remained in office (now in the constellation ÖVP–BZÖ, with the remaining FPÖ in opposition) until the next elections.  On 1 October 2006 the SPÖ won a [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|head on head elections]] and negotiated a grand coalition with the ÖVP.  This coalition started its term on 11 January 2007 with [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor of Austria. For the first time, the [[Green Party of Austria]] became the third largest party in a nation-wide election, overtaking the FPÖ by a narrow margin of only a few hundred votes.

The grand coalition headed by Alfred Gusenbauer collapsed in the early summer of 2008 over disagreements about the country's EU policy. The [[Austrian legislative election, 2008|early elections]] held on September 28 resulted in extensive losses for the two ruling parties and corresponding gains for [[Heinz-Christian Strache]]'s FPÖ and [[Jörg Haider]]'s BZÖ (the Green Party was relegated to the 5th position). Nevertheless, SPÖ and ÖVP renewed their coalition under the leadership of the new SPÖ party chairman [[Werner Faymann]]. In 2008 [[Jörg Haider]] died in a car accident and was succeeded as BZÖ party chairman by [[Herbert Scheibner]] and as governor of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] by [[Gerhard Dörfler]].
