The '''Paleolithic''' (also spelled '''Palaeolithic''' or '''Palæolithic''') '''Age''', '''Era''' or '''Period''', is a prehistoric period of [[human history]] distinguished by the development of the least primitive [[stone tool]]s discovered (Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological [[prehistory]]. It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by [[Hominina|Hominins]] such as ''[[Australopithecines]]'', 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the [[Pleistocene]] around 10,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name=Thoth&amp;Schick&gt;{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Paleoanthropology |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u68378621542472j/ | first=Nicholas | last=Toth | first2=Kathy | last2=Schick | year=2007 | volume=Volume 3 | contribution=21 Overview of Paleolithic Archaeology | editor-first=H.C.

The date of the Paleolithic—Mesolithic boundary may vary by locality as much as several thousand years.

Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including [[leather]] and vegetable [[fibers]]; however, due to their nature, these have not been preserved to any great degree. Surviving artifacts of the Paleolithic era are known as [[paleolith]]s. Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus ''[[Homo genus|Homo]]'' such as ''[[Homo habilis]]''&amp;nbsp;– who used simple stone tools&amp;nbsp;– into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans (''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'') during the Paleolithic era.&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta.msn.com&quot;&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394/Human_Evolution.html &quot;Human Evolution,&quot; Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] Contributed by Richard B.

Retrieved March 2, 2008, from http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061130081347.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[climate]] during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and [[interglacial period]]s in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures.

The term &quot;[[wikt:Paleolithic|Paleolithic]]&quot; was coined by archaeologist [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] in 1865. It derives from Greek: [[wikt:παλαιός|παλαιός]], ''palaios'', &quot;old&quot;; and [[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]], ''lithos'', &quot;stone&quot;, literally meaning &quot;old age of the stone&quot; or &quot;Old [[Stone Age]].&quot;

One rich source of Paleothic artifacts has been the [[Euphrates]] river valley. Excavations started in the 1960s, when the Turkish government built the [[Keban]] dam on the river. The Keban historical salvage project was organized by [[Kemal Kurdas]], then rector of Middle East Technical University, and a team of Turkish, American and Dutch archeologists led by Maurits van Loon excavated. Later more dams were built and salvage operations took place, unearthing settlements going back to the Paleolithic.

==Paleogeography and climate==

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The Paleolithic climate consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods.]]
The climate of the Paleolithic Period spanned two geologic epochs known as the [[Pliocene]] and the [[Pleistocene]]. Both of these epochs experienced important geographic and climatic changes that affected human societies.

During the Pliocene, continents continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] from possibly as far as 250&amp;nbsp;km from their present locations to positions only 70&amp;nbsp;km from their current location. [[South America]] became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]], bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[marsupialia|marsupial]] fauna. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, because warm [[equator]]ial ocean currents were cut off, and the cold Arctic and Antarctic waters lowered temperatures in the now-isolated [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Central America]] formed completely  during the Pliocene, allowing fauna from North and South America to leave their native habitats and colonize new areas.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pli.html |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pliocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Asia]] created the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. During the [[Pleistocene]], the modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions; the [[tectonic plate]]s on which they sit have probably moved at most 100&amp;nbsp;km from each other since the beginning of the period.&lt;ref name=Scotese&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm|author=Christopher Scotese|title=Paleomap project |accessdate=2008-03-23|work=The Earth has been in an Ice House Climate for the last 30 million years|authorlink=Christopher Scotese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climates during the Pliocene became cooler and drier, and seasonal, similar to modern climates. [[Ice sheet]]s grew on [[Antarctica]]. The formation of an Arctic ice cap around 3 Ma is signaled by an abrupt shift in [[oxygen]] [[isotope]] ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North [[Atlantic]] and North [[Pacific ocean]] beds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andel&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Van Andel|first=Tjeerd H.|title=New Views on an Old Planet: A History of Global Change.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|location=Cambridge|pages=454 pp.|isbn=0-521-44243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-latitude [[glacier|glaciation]] probably began before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene/&gt;

The [[Pleistocene]] climate was characterized by repeated glacial cycles during which [[continental glacier]]s pushed to the 40th [[parallel (latitude)|parallel]] in some places. Four major glacial events have been identified, as well as many minor intervening events. A major event is a general glacial excursion, termed a &quot;glacial&quot;. Glacials are separated by &quot;interglacials&quot;. During a glacial, the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats. The minor excursion is a &quot;stadial&quot;; times between stadials are &quot;interstadials&quot;. Each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets 1500–3000 m deep, resulting in temporary sea level drops of 100 m or more over the entire surface of the Earth. During interglacial times, such as at present, drowned coastlines were common, mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions.

The effects of glaciation were global. [[Antarctica]] was ice-bound throughout the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene. The [[Andes]] were covered in the south by the [[Patagonia]]n ice cap. There were glaciers in [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]. The now decaying glaciers of [[Mount Kenya]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Ruwenzori Range]] in east and central Africa were larger. Glaciers existed in the mountains of [[Ethiopia]] and to the west in the [[Atlas mountains]]. In the northern hemisphere, many glaciers fused into one. The [[Cordilleran ice sheet]] covered the North American northwest; the [[Laurentide]] covered the east. The Fenno-Scandian ice sheet covered northern [[Europe]], including [[Great Britain]]; the Alpine ice sheet covered the Alps. Scattered domes stretched across [[Siberia]] and the Arctic shelf. The northern seas were frozen. During the late Upper Paleolithic (Latest Pleistocene) ''c.'' 18,000 BP, the [[Beringa]] land bridge between [[Asia]] and [[North America]] was blocked by ice,&lt;ref name=Scotese/&gt; which [[Clovis culture#Evidence of human habitation before Clovis|may have prevented]] early [[Paleo-Indian]]s such as the [[Clovis culture]] from directly crossing Beringa to reach the Americas.

According to [[Mark Lynas]] (through collected data), the Pleistocene's overall climate could be characterized as a continuous [[El Niño]] with [[trade winds]] in the south [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] weakening or heading east, warm air rising near [[Peru]], warm water spreading from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific, and other El Niño markers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]], ''Six Degrees Could Change The World'', Mark Lynas interview. Retrieved February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice age ended with the end of the Paleolithic era (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the extinction of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], although it is also possible that the late [[Quaternary extinction event|Pleistocene extinctions]] were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and over hunting by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/ple.html|title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pleistocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080401-mammoth-extinction.html|author=Kimberly Johnson|title=National geographic news|accessdate=2008-04-04|work=Climate Change, Then Humans, Drove Mammoths Extinct from National geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New research suggests that the extinction of the [[woolly mammoth]] may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the [[Pleistocene]] caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the [[Holocene]] may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]] and [[Wrangel Island]], till circa 3700 and 1700 BCE respectively.

Due to a lack of written records from this time period, nearly all of our knowledge of Paleolithic human culture and way of life comes from [[archaeology]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] comparisons to modern hunter-gatherer cultures such as the [[Bushmen|!Kung San]] who live similarly to their Paleolithic predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leften Stavrianos&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9H6oqN3Q-GoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Paleolithic+egalitarianism |title=Lifelines from Our Past: A New World History| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=M.E.

===Distribution===
At the beginning of the Paleolithic, hominids were found primarily in eastern Africa, east of the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Most known hominid fossils dating earlier than 1 million years before present are found in this area, particularly in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Ethiopia]].

By 1.5-2 million years before present, groups of hominids began leaving Africa and settling southern Europe and Asia. Southern Caucasus was occupied by 1.7 million years BP, and northern China was reached by 1.66 million years BP. By the end of the Lower Paleolithic, members of the hominid family were living in what is now China, western Indonesia, and, in Europe, around the Mediterranean and as far north as England, southern Germany, and Bulgaria. Their further northward expansion may have been limited by the lack of control of fire: studies of cave settlements in Europe indicate no regular use of fire prior to 300,000-400,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the earliest evidence for habitual use of fire in Europe&quot;, Wil Roebroeks et al, PNAS, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; East Asian fossils from this period are typically placed in the genus [[Homo erectus]]. Very little fossil evidence is available at known Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe, but it is believed that hominids who habited these sites were likewise ''Homo erectus''. There is no evidence of hominids in America, Australia, or almost anywhere in Oceania during this time period. 

Fates of these early colonists, and their relationships to modern humans, are still subject to debate. According to current archeological and genetic models, there were at least two notable expansion events subsequent to peopling of Eurasia 2-1.5 million years BP. Around 500,000 BP, a group of early humans, frequently called [[Homo heidelbergensis]], came to Europe from Africa and eventually evolved into [[Neanderthals]]. Both ''Homo erectus'' and Neanderthals went extinct by the end of the Paleolithic, having been replaced by a new wave of humans, the anatomically modern [[Homo sapiens]], which emerged in eastern Africa circa 200,000 BP, left Africa around 50,000 BP and expanded throughout the planet. It is likely that multiple groups coexisted for some time in certain locations. Neanderthals were still found in parts of Eurasia 30,000 years before present, and engaged in a limited degree of interbreeding with ''Homo sapiens''. Hominid fossils not belonging either to ''Homo neanderthalensis'' or to ''Homo sapiens'' geni, found in Altai and Indonesia, were radiocarbon dated to 30,000-40,000 BP and 17,000 BP respectively. 

The technological revolution of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic allowed humans to reach places that weren't accessible earlier. In the Middle Paleolithic, Neanderthals were present in Poland. By 40,000-50,000 BP, first humans set foot in Australia. By 45,000 BP, humans lived at 61° north latitude in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sami&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/dieda/hist/SamiPrehistRevisitNew.htm|title=Sami Prehistory Revisited: transactions, admixture and assimilation in the phylogeographic picture of Scandinavia|author=John Weinstock}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 30,000 BP, Japan was reached, and by 27,000 BP humans were present in Siberia above the Arctic Circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sami&quot; /&gt; At the end of the Upper Paleolithic, a group of humans crossed the Bering land bridge and quickly expanded throughout North and South America. Northern Eurasia became depopulated during the last Glacial Maximum (27,000 to 16,000 BP), but was repopulated as the climate got warmer and glaciers retreated.

For the duration of the Paleolithic, human populations remained low, especially outside the equatorial region. The entire population of Europe between 16,000-11,000 BP likely averaged some 30,000 individuals, and, between 40,000-16,000 BP, it was even lower, at 4,000-6,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.evolhum.cnrs.fr/bocquet/jas2005.pdf|title=Estimates of Upper Palaeolithic meta-population size in Europe from archaeological data|author=Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel et al|year=2005|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleolithic humans made tools of stone, bone, and wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos&quot;/&gt; The earliest Paleolithic stone tool industry, the [[Olduwan]], was developed by the earliest members of the genus ''Homo'' such as ''Homo habilis'', around 2.6 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |author=Klein, R. |year=1999 |title=The Human Career |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained tools such as choppers, [[burin]]s and [[wikt:awl|awls]]. It was completely replaced around 250,000 years ago by the more complex Acheulean industry, which was first conceived by ''Homo ergaster'' around 1.8 or 1.65 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Roche H et al., 2002, ''Les sites archaéologiques pio-pléistocènes de la formation de Nachuku 663–673, qtd in Scarre, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent Lower Paleolithic (Acheulean) implements completely vanished from the archeological record around 100,000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age tool kits such as the [[Mousterian]] and the [[Aterian]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Desmond Clark|Clark, JD]], ''Variability in primary and secondary technologies of the Later Acheulian in Africa'' in Milliken, S and Cook, J (eds), 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower Paleolithic humans used a variety of stone tools, including [[hand axe]]s and choppers. Although they appear to have used hand axes often, there is disagreement about their use. Interpretations range from cutting and chopping tools, to digging implements, flake cores, the use in traps and a purely ritual significance, maybe in courting behavior. [[William H. Calvin]] has suggested that some hand axes could have served as &quot;killer Frisbees&quot; meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a water hole so as to stun one of them. There are no indications of hafting, and some artifacts are far too large for that. Thus, a thrown hand axe would not usually have penetrated deeply enough to cause very serious injuries. Nevertheless, it could have been an effective weapon for defense against predators. Choppers and scrapers were likely used for skinning and butchering scavenged animals and sharp ended sticks were often obtained for digging up edible roots. Presumably, early humans used wooden spears as early as 5 million years ago to hunt small animals, much as their relatives, [[chimpanzee]]s, have been observed to do in [[Senegal]], Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Weiss, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html &quot;Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower Paleolithic humans constructed shelters such as the possible wood hut at [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]].

Fire was used by the Lower Paleolithic hominid ''[[Homo erectus]]''/''[[Homo ergaster]]'' as early as 300,000 or 1.5 million years ago and possibly even earlier by the early Lower Paleolithic (Oldowan) hominid ''Homo habilis'' and/or by robust australopithecines such as ''[[Paranthropus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McClellan&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=McClellan|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA11 | title=Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction| location=Baltimore, Maryland | publisher=JHU Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-8018-8360-1}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA8 Page 8–12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the use of fire only became common in the societies of the following [[Middle Stone Age]]/[[Middle Paleolithic]] Period.&lt;ref name=Thoth&amp;Schick/&gt;  Use of fire reduced mortality rates and provided protection against predators.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marlowe FW |title=Hunter-gatherers and human evolution |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=2 | page = 15294 |year=2005 |format=PDF|url=http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/marlowe_pubs/hunter-gatherers%20and%20human%20evolution.pdf | doi = 10.1002/evan.20046}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early hominids may have begun to cook their food as early as the Lower Paleolithic (''c.'' 1.9 million years ago) or at the latest in the early Middle Paleolithic (''c.'' 250,000 years ago).&lt;ref name=Wrangham&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wrangham R, Conklin-Brittain N. |title=Cooking as a biological trait |journal=Comp Biochem Physiol a Mol Integr Physiol |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |year=2003 September|pmid=14527628 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00020-5 |url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have hypothesized that Hominids began cooking food to defrost frozen meat, which would help ensure their survival in cold regions.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt;

'''Paleolithic people were considered to to be the first human societies. They traveled in small bands normally in the range of 25-50. Their relationship were based on kinship and the limited technology permitted for a low population density(Strayer). Their society was highly egalitarian however woman were viewed as gathers and man as hunters.Unlike the Neolithic era the Paleolithic people lacked inequality seen with the growth of power and urbanization in the Neolithic era. Although socially &quot;equal the Paleolithic peoples did not ensure a utopia of social harmony (Strayer).

|quote=&lt;!-- The selective factors that favored coalitionary killing of neighbors may have remained in play until as late as 1 million years ago. The precise chronology of the persistence of these selective factors during the Lower Paleolithic remains an open question at present. However, the development of the throwing spear, used in conjunction with ambush hunting techniques, ushered in an era in which the enhanced lethality of weaponry amplified the costs of assessment errors, and the necessity of movement also placed intruders at a comparative disadvantage with respect to both detection and assessment. Moreover, asymmetrical detection rather than a numerical imbalance of power determined the outcome of hostile encounters. This reconfiguration of the decisive factors in lethal conflict not only raised the stakes (or potential costs) for would-be aggressors but also rendered the benefit of intercommunity dominance unattainable. Because superior numbers were not invariably decisive in encounters between hunting parties, an initial success would neither materially reduce the stakes for aggressors in subsequent attacks nor make it possible to freely encroach on the territory of a neighboring group that had sustained a casualty. Under these circumstances, aggression resulted in stalemate and a condition analogous to a war of attrition rather than territorial gain. 

These developments marked a major turning point in the evolution of lethal intergroup violence and in the character of interrelations between neighboring groups. Although fitness continued to be related to territory size (for food-limited populations in occupied environments), selective circumstances no longer favored aggression as a means of achieving territorial gain. Conflict avoidance and the development of intergroup relations of friendship, mutuality, sharing, and cooperation were favored instead. Intragroup cooperation was elaborated in conjunction with the teamwork entailed by large game hunting and was further reinforced by mechanisms for sharing large animals jointly killed by a hunting party. Development of these practices provided a template for establishing positive relations between neighboring social groups that could readily be realized when two bands temporarily camped and hunted together. Conflict avoidance dictated that groups move apart to alleviate resource competition whenever possible. This response to crowding facilitated migration out of Africa into the temperate and subtropical zones of Europe and Asia, vastly expanding the geographic distribution of H. erectus. In other words, the development of the throwing spear altered the means of production as well as the social relations of production, distribution, and consumption within groups in fundamental ways that also transformed intergroup relations and influenced subsequent hominid evolution. 

This period of Paleolithic warlessness, grounded in low population density, an appreciation of the benefits of positive relations with neighbors, and a healthy respect for their defensive capabilities, lasted until the cultural development of segmental forms of organization engendered the origin of war (7). This organizational transformation facilitated the mobilization of all adult male group members and their participation in preplanned dawn raids on settlements in which the tactical advantages of surprise and numerical superiority could be brought to bear. At this juncture, the unit involved in combat is a raiding party (a military organization) rather than a hunting party (an economic organization), and the location of combat shifts from the border zone to the sleeping quarters at the core of a group's territory. At the same time, the intrinsic military advantage shifts from defenders to attackers. All of the attackers are combatants, whereas less than half of those under attack are armed. Attackers characteristically inflict numerous casualties while suffering few or none. This outcome is a consequence of weaponry amplifying the advantages of surprise and numerical superiority. 

The earliest conclusive archaeological evidence for attacks on settlements is a Nubian cemetery (site 117) near the present-day town of Jebel Sahaba in the Sudan dated at 12,000–14,000 [[Before_present|BP]] (7, 12). War originated independently in other parts of the world at dates as late as 4000 BP (13). Otterbein argues that agriculture was only able to develop initially at locations where ambushes, battles, and raids were absent (14).--&gt;

Some Upper Paleolithic societies in resource-rich environments (such as societies in [[Sungir]], in what is now [[Russia]]) may have had more complex and hierarchical organization (such as [[tribe]]s with a pronounced hierarchy and a somewhat formal [[division of labor]]) and may have engaged in [[endemic warfare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Raymond C. Warless societies and the origin of war. Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue that there was no formal leadership during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Like contemporary egalitarian hunter-gatherers such as the [[Mbuti#Political structure|Mbuti]] pygmies, societies may have made decisions by communal [[consensus decision making]] rather than by appointing permanent rulers such as chiefs and [[monarch]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusimba 2003 285&quot;/&gt; Nor was there a formal [[division of labor]] during the Paleolithic. Each member of the group was skilled at all tasks essential to survival, regardless of individual abilities. Theories to explain the apparent egalitarianism have arisen, notably the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[primitive communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Communist Manifesto |first=Karl |last=Marx |url= http://books.google.com/?id=TiKKmyacAiAC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;vq=Primitive+communism|coauthors=Friedrich Engels |year=1848 |location=London |page=87 |isbn=978-1-59986-995-7 }} Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marxism and History: A Critical Introduction |author=Stephen Henry Rigby |url= http://books.google.com/?id=6wFHth05xkoC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=primitive+communism |year=1999 |location=Manchester Connecticut |page=314 |isbn=0-7190-5612-8 |unused_data=Manchester University Press}} Page 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Christopher Boehm (1999) has hypothesized that egalitarianism may have evolved in Paleolithic societies because of a need to distribute resources such as food and meat equally to avoid famine and ensure a stable food supply.&lt;ref name=Bohem&gt;Christopher Boehm (1999) [http://books.google.com/books?id=ljxS8gUlgqgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Paleolithic&amp;lr=&amp;sig=V-GOM-s3rCApE_baw2oRoaw24w8#PPA192,M1 &quot;Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior&quot; page 192] Harvard university press&lt;/ref&gt;  Raymond C. Kelly speculates that the relative peacefulness of Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies resulted from a low population density, cooperative relationships between groups such as reciprocal exchange of commodities and collaboration on hunting expeditions, and because the invention of projectile weapons such as throwing spears provided less incentive for war, because they increased the damage done to the attacker and decreased the relative amount of territory attackers could gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;/&gt;  However, other sources claim that most Paleolithic groups may have been larger, more complex, sedentary and warlike than most contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, due to occupying more resource-abundant areas than most modern hunter-gatherers who have been pushed into more marginal habitats by agricultural societies.&lt;ref name=Kiefer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suluarchipelago.com/E20Website2002/default.htm|title=Anthropology E-20|accessdate=2008-03-11 |author=Thomas M.

Early examples of artistic expression, such as the [[Venus of Tan-Tan]] and the patterns found on [[elephant]] bones from [[Bilzingsleben (Paleolithic site)|Bilzingsleben]] in [[Thuringia]], may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' prior to the start of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period.

According to Robert G. Bednarik, Lower Paleolithic [[Acheulean]] tool users began to engage in symbolic behavior such as art around 850,000 BP and decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic rather than utilitarian qualities.&lt;ref name=Bednarik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/frontline/bednarik.htm |title=Beads and the origins of symbolism |author=Robert G. Bednarik |accessdate=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bednarik, traces of the pigment ochre from late Lower Paleolithic Acheulean archeological sites suggests that Acheulean societies, like later Upper Paleolithic societies, collected and used ochre to create rock art.&lt;ref name=Bednarik/&gt; Nevertheless, it is also possible that the ochre traces found at Lower Paleolithic sites is naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G.

[[Upper Paleolithic]] humans produced works of art such as cave paintings, Venus figurines, animal carvings and rock paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Paleolithic Art,&quot; Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007
http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578676/Paleolithic_Art.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper Paleolithic art can be divided into two broad categories: figurative art such as cave paintings that clearly depicts animals (or more rarely humans); and nonfigurative, which consists of shapes and symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  Cave paintings have been interpreted in a number of ways by modern archeologists. The earliest explanation, by the prehistorian [[Abbe Breuil]], interpreted the paintings as a form of magic designed to ensure a successful hunt.&lt;ref name=Clottes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |title=Shamanism in Prehistory |author=Jean Clottes |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work=Bradshaw foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this hypothesis fails to explain the existence of animals such as [[saber-toothed cat]]s and [[lion]]s, which were not hunted for food, and the existence of half-human, half-animal beings in cave paintings. The anthropologist [[David Lewis-Williams]] has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of [[shaman]]istic practices, because the paintings of half-human, half-animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter-gatherer shamanistic practices.&lt;ref name=Clottes/&gt;  Symbol-like images are more common in Paleolithic cave paintings than are depictions of animals or humans, and unique symbolic patterns might have been trademarks that represent different [[Upper Paleolithic]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paleolithic Art,&quot; Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007
http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578676/Paleolithic_Art.html Microsoft Encarta&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venus figurines]] have evoked similar controversy. Archeologists and anthropologists have described the figurines as representations of [[goddesses]], [[pornography|pornographic]] imagery, apotropaic amulets used for sympathetic magic, and even as self-portraits of women themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=McDeroy&gt;McDermott, LeRoy. &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204%28199604%2937%3A2%3C227%3ASIUPFF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage Self-Representation in Upper Paleolithic Female Figurines]&quot;.

[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/311260.html Preface].&lt;/ref&gt;  has studied not only the most artistic and publicized paintings, but also a variety of lower-quality art and figurines, and he identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists. He also points out that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the over-sexual representation of women) are to be expected in the fantasies of adolescent males during the Upper Paleolithic.

The Venus figurines have sometimes been interpreted as representing a [[mother goddess]]; the abundance of such female imagery has led some to believe that Upper Paleolithic (and later Neolithic) societies had a female-centered religion and a female-dominated society.  For example, this was proposed by the archeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] and the [[feminist]] scholar [[Merlin Stone]] who was the author of the 1978 book ''When God Was a Woman.''&lt;ref name=Merlinstone&gt;{{cite book |title=When God Was a Woman |author=Merlin Stone.

The Civilization of the Goddess&lt;/ref&gt;  Various other explanations for the purpose of the figurines have been proposed, such as Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott’s hypothesis that the figurines were created as self portraits of actual women&lt;ref name=&quot;McDeroy&quot;/&gt; and R.Dale Gutrie's hypothesis that the venus figurines represented a kind of &quot;stone age [[pornography]]&quot;.
 
The origins of music during the Paleolithic are unknown, since the earliest forms of music probably did not use musical instruments but instead used the human voice and or natural objects such as rocks, which leave no trace in the archaeological record. However, the [[anthropological]] and [[archeological]] designation suggests that human music first arose when language, art and other modern behaviors developed in the Middle or the Upper Paleolithic period. Music may have developed from rhythmic sounds produced by daily activities such as cracking nuts by hitting them with stones, because maintaining a rhythm while working may have helped people to become more efficient at daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bücher. '''Trabajo y ritmo'''. Biblioteca Científico-Filosófica, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative theory originally proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] explains that music may have begun as a hominid mating strategy as many birds and some other animals produce music like calls to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. '''The origin of man'''. Edimat books, S. A. ISBN 84-8403-034-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is generally less accepted than the previous hypothesis, but it nonetheless provides a possible alternative.  Another explanation is that humans began to make music simply because of the pleasure it produced.

[[Upper Paleolithic]] (and possibly [[Middle Paleolithic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BoneAge&quot;&gt;Nelson, D.E., ''Radiocarbon dating of bone and charcoal from Divje babe I cave'', cited by Morley, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;)    humans used [[flute]]-like bone pipes as musical instruments,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bahn, Paul 1996&quot;&gt;Bahn, Paul (1996) &quot;The atlas of world archeology&quot; Copyright 2000 The Brown Reference Group PLC&lt;/ref&gt;  and music may have played a large role in the religious lives of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. Like in modern hunter-gatherer societies, music may have been used in ritual or to help induce [[trance]]s. In particular, it appears that animal skin [[drum]]s may have been used in religious events by Upper Paleolithic shamans, as shown by the remains of drum-like instruments from some Upper Paleolithic graves of shamans and the [[ethnography|ethnographic]] record of contemporary hunter-gatherer shamanic and ritual practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt;

Fallio, have recently proposed that religion and spirituality (and art) may have first arisen in Pre-Paleolithic chimpanzees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/chimpspiritdatabase.pdf |title=Appendices for chimpanzee spirituality by James Harrod |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or Early [[Lower Paleolithic]] ([[Oldowan]]) societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;V.Fallio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/mindold.html |title=Oldowan Art, Religion, Symbols, Mind by James Harrod |publisher=Originsnet.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fallio, the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans experienced altered states of consciousness and partook in ritual, and ritual was used in their societies to strengthen social bonding and group cohesion.&lt;ref name=&quot;V.Fallio&quot;/&gt;

Middle Paleolithic humans' use of burials at sites such as [[Krapina]], Croatia (''c.'' 130,000 BP) and [[Qafzeh]], Israel (''c.'' 100,000 BP) have led some anthropologists and archeologists, such as [[Philip Lieberman]], to believe that Middle Paleolithic humans may have possessed a belief in an [[afterlife]] and a &quot;concern for the dead that transcends daily life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Uniquely+Human+cognitive-linguistic+base| title=Uniquely Human|author=phillip lieberman|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites, such as Combe-Grenal and Abri Moula in [[France]], suggest that the [[Neanderthal#Cannibalism or ritual defleshing.3F|Neanderthals]] like some contemporary human cultures may have practiced [[excarnation|ritual defleshing]] for (presumably) religious reasons. According to recent archeological findings from ''[[H. heidelbergensis]]'' sites in [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]], humans may have begun burying their dead much earlier, during the late [[Lower Paleolithic]]; but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community.

Likewise, some scientists have proposed that Middle Paleolithic societies such as Neanderthal societies may also have practiced the earliest form of [[totemism]] or [[animal worship]], in addition to their (presumably religious) burial of the dead.  In particular, Emil Bächler suggested (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a [[bear]] [[cult]] was widespread among Middle Paleolithic [[Neanderthal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wunn, Ina (2000). &quot;Beginning of Religion&quot;, Numen, '''47'''(4), pp. 434–435&lt;/ref&gt;   A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BCE originates from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert has been denied by the original investigators of the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceDaily&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Lawrence H.|coauthors=AlecC.

The existence of anthropomorphic images and half-human, half-animal images in the Upper Paleolithic period may further indicate that [[Upper Paleolithic]] humans were the first people to believe in a [[Polytheism|pantheon of gods or supernatural beings]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mithen&quot;&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Steve Mithen|isbn=0-500-05081-3| title=The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science| year=1996| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| author=Steven Mithen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  though such images may instead indicate shamanistic practices similar to those of contemporary tribal societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clottes&quot;/&gt;  The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman (and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices) dates back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] era (''c.'' 30,000 BP) in what is now the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt; However, during the early Upper Paleolithic it was probably more common for all members of the band to participate equally and fully in religious ceremonies, in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos&quot;/&gt; Additionally, it is also possible that Upper Paleolithic religions, like contemporary and historical [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, believed in the existence of a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as animistic spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From earth spirits to sky gods Socioecological Origins of Monotheism|last= Lerro |first=Bruce |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qs5RqLdx1HgC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=Paleolithic |year=2000 |publisher=Lexington Press |location= Lanham MD |isbn=0-7391-0098-X |page=327 }} pages 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent W. Fallio writes that [[ancestor worship|ancestor cults]] first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies. He argues that the elites of these societies (like the elites of many more contemporary complex hunter-gatherers such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies, by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that also gives them control over the earthly realm.&lt;ref name=&quot;V.Fallio&quot;/&gt;  [[Secret societies]] may have served a similar function in these complex quasi-[[theocratic]] societies, by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the separate spheres of Popular Religion and Elite Religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;V.Fallio&quot;/&gt;

Religion was possibly [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]]; specifically, it may have involved sympathetic magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2006&quot;/&gt; The [[Venus figurines]], which are abundant in the Upper Paleolithic archeological record, provide an example of possible Paleolithic sympathetic magic, as they may have been used for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;McClellan&quot; /&gt;  The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have sometimes been explained as depictions of an [[earth goddess]] similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], or as representations of a goddess who is the ruler or mother of the animals.&lt;ref name=Narr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=52333 |author=Karl J.

The Paleolithic was an extended period of time, during which multiple technological advances were made, many of which had impact on human dietary structure. For example, it is almost undisputed (with only a few scholars adopting the divergent view) that, for much of the Paleolithic, humans did not possess the control of fire, or tools necessary to engage in extensive [[fishing]]. On the other hand, both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans by the end of the Paleolithic (consequently, allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting). In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]]. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as [[New Guinea]] and [[Alaska]], and adapting their diets to whatever local resources available.

According to some anthropologists and advocates of the modern [[Paleolithic diet]], Paleolithic hunter-gatherers consumed a significant amount of meat and possibly obtained most of their food from hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Cordain L.
