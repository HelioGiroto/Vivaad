The '''Dark Ages''' is a historical [[periodization]] used for the [[Middle Ages]]. The term emphasizes the cultural and economic deterioration that supposedly&lt;!---&quot;supposedly&quot; is the correct npov adjective. See below. Attempts to delete this will be rv--&gt; occurred in Europe following the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|quote=a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time; often restricted to the early period of the Middle Ages, between the time of the fall of Rome and the appearance of vernacular written documents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dark%20age &quot;Dark age&quot;] in [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; The label employs traditional [[light versus darkness|light-versus-darkness]] imagery to contrast the &quot;darkness&quot; of the period with earlier and later periods of &quot;light&quot;.&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore | authorlink =Theodor Mommsen | coauthors = | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period is characterized by a relative scarcity of historical and other written records at least for some areas of Europe, rendering it obscure to historians.  The term &quot;Dark Age&quot; itself derives from the Latin ''[[saeculum obscurum]]'', originally applied by [[Caesar Baronius]] in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, John C., ''Church history: twenty centuries of Catholic Christianity'', (1998) p. 155.&lt;br&gt;[[Baronius]], Caesar. ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, 1602, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the term characterized the bulk of the [[Middle Ages]], or roughly the 6th to 13th centuries, as a period of intellectual darkness between the extinguishing of the &quot;light of Rome&quot; after the end of [[Late Antiquity]], and the rise of the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarca, ''De sui ipsius et multorum ignorantia'', ed. M. Capelli (Paris, 1906), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; This definition is still found in popular usage,&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Franklin | first=James | title=The Renaissance Myth | journal=Quadrant | volume=26 | issue=11 | year=1982 | pages=51–60 | url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/renaissance.html | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}, for example. Franklin is a mathematician who is discussing popularly-held misconceptions about mathematics and science, such as that &quot;[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] revolutionised physics by dropping weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].&quot; From his perspective as a mathematician, he says that the Dark Ages were sometimes very real, citing [[Isadore of Seville]]'s writing that a cylinder was 'a square figure with a semicircle on top'.&lt;/ref&gt; but increased recognition of the accomplishments of the Middle Ages since the 19th century has led to the label being restricted in application. Since the 20th century, it is frequently applied only to the earlier part of the era, the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 5th–10th century).&lt;ref&gt;Ker, W. P. (1904). [http://books.google.com/books?id=4XxzlEQPwMIC The dark ages]. New York: C. Scribner's Sons. Page 1. (''cf''. The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages — or the Middle Age — used to be the same; two names for the same period. But they have come to be distinguished, and the Dark Ages are now no more than the first part of the Middle Age, while the term mediaeval is often restricted to the later centuries, about 1100 to 1500, the age of chivalry, the time between the first Crusade and the Renaissance. This was not the ''old view'', and it does not agree with the ''proper'' meaning of the name.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Syed Ziaur Rahman]], Were the “Dark Ages” Really Dark?, ''Grey Matter'' (The Co-curricular Journal of [[Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh|Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College]]), [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Aligarh, 2003: 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; However, many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Christopher A.|author-link=Christopher Snyder|year=1998|contribution=|contribution-url=|title=An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons A.D. 400&amp;ndash;600|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|publication-date=1998|publication-place=University Park|pages=xiii&amp;ndash;xiv|isbn=0-271-01780-5|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}. In explaining his approach to writing the work, Snyder refers to the &quot;so-called Dark Ages&quot;, noting that &quot;Historians and archaeologists have never liked the label Dark Ages ... there are numerous indicators that these centuries were neither &quot;dark&quot; nor &quot;barbarous&quot; in comparison with other eras.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmas&gt;[[William Chester Jordan|Jordan, Chester William]] (2004).

The concept of a Dark Age originated with the Italian scholar [[Petrarch]] (Francesco Petrarca) in the 1330s, and was originally intended as a sweeping criticism of the character of [[Vulgar Latin|Late Latin]] [[Latin literature|literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mommsen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Bard|title=Humanists and Reformers: A History of the Renaissance and Reformation|publisher=Erdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|year=1996|pages=13|isbn=978-0-8028-6348-5|quote=Petrarch was the very first to speak of the Middle Ages as a 'dark age', one that separated him from the riches and pleasures of classical antiquity and that broke the connection between his own age and the civilization of the Greeks and the Romans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch regarded the post-Roman centuries as &quot;dark&quot; compared to the light of [[classical antiquity]]. Later historians expanded the term to refer to the transitional period between [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and the [[High Middle Ages]] (c. 11th–13th century), including not only the lack of Latin literature, but also a lack of contemporary [[Recorded history|written history]], general demographic decline, limited building activity and material cultural achievements in general. Later historians and writers picked up the concept, and popular culture has further expanded on it as a vehicle to depict the Middle Ages as a time of backwardness, extending its pejorative use and expanding its scope.&lt;ref name=tainter&gt;{{cite book | last = Tainter  | first = Joseph A. | authorlink = Joseph Tainter | coauthors = [[Graeme Barker|Barker, Graeme]] (ed.) | chapter = Post Collapse Societies | title = Companion Encyclopedia of Archaeology | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | location = Abingdon, England | pages = 988 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-415-06448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was originally intended to denote the entire period between the fall of Rome and the [[Renaissance]]; the term &quot;[[Middle Ages]]&quot; has a similar motivation, implying an intermediate period between [[Classical Antiquity]] and the [[Modern era]]. In the 19th century scholars began to recognize the accomplishments made during the period, thereby challenging the image of the Middle Ages as a time of darkness and decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Franklin | first=James | title=The Renaissance Myth | journal=Quadrant | volume=26 | issue=11 | year=1982 | pages=51–60 | url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/renaissance.html | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now never used by scholars to refer to the entire medieval period;&lt;ref name=dmas&gt;William Chester Jordan|Jordan, William Chester. ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Supplement 1, 2004. Verdun, Kathleen, &quot;Medievalism&quot; pp. 389–397. Sections 'Victorian Medievalism', 'Nineteenth-Century Europe', 'Medievalism in America 1500–1900', 'The 20th Century'. Same volume, [[Paul Freedman|Freedman Paul]], &quot;Medieval Studies&quot;, pp. 383–389.&lt;/ref&gt; when used, it is generally restricted to the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;

The rise of [[archaeology]] and other specialties in the 20th century has shed much light on the period and offered a more nuanced understanding of its positive developments.&lt;ref name=tainter/&gt; Other terms of [[periodization]] have come to the fore: [[Late Antiquity]], the Early Middle Ages, and the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], depending on which aspects of culture are being emphasized. When modern scholarly study of the Middle Ages arose in the 19th century, the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was at first kept, with all its critical overtones. On the rare occasions when the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is used by historians today, it is intended to be neutral, namely, to express the idea that the events of the period often seem &quot;dark&quot; because of the scarcity of artistic and cultural output,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]] (1969), ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' (BBC Books)&lt;/ref&gt; including historical records, when compared with both earlier and later times.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt;

===Petrarch===

Images like this one celebrate the triumph of Christianity over the paganism of Antiquity]]

The idea of a Dark Age originated with [[Petrarch]] in the 1330s.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;/&gt; Writing of those who had come before him, he said: &quot;Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were ''surrounded by darkness'' and dense gloom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1367). ''Apologia cuiusdam anonymi Galli calumnias'' (''Defence against the calumnies of an anonymous Frenchman''), in Petrarch, ''Opera Omnia'', Basel, 1554, p. 1195. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article, where the source is given in a footnote. Cf. also Marsh, D, ed., (2003), ''Invectives'', Harvard University Press, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, including Petrarch himself,&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; had long used traditional [[metaphor]]s of &quot;[[light versus darkness]]&quot; to describe &quot;[[Good and evil|good versus evil]]&quot;. Petrarch was the first to co-opt the metaphor and give it [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. Classical Antiquity, so long considered the &quot;dark&quot; age for its lack of Christianity, was now seen by Petrarch as the age of &quot;light&quot; because of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;

As an Italian, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire]] and the classical period as expressions of Italian greatness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; He spent much of his time travelling through Europe rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the classical Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Humanists]] saw the preceding 900-year period as a time of stagnation. They saw history unfolding, not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through the progressive developments of classical ideals, literature, and art.

Petrarch wrote that history had had two periods: the classic period of the Greeks and Romans, followed by a time of darkness, in which he saw himself as still living. In around 1343, in the conclusion to his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: &quot;My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last for ever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, &quot;better age&quot;, which they believed the world had entered. The term &quot;Middle Ages,&quot; in Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604), was later used to describe the period of supposed decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albrow&quot;&gt;Albrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
During the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] wrote of the Middle Ages as a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] corruption. Just as Petrarch's writing was not an attack on Christianity per se — along with his humanism, he was deeply occupied with the search for God — neither was this an attack on Christianity: it was a drive to restore what Protestants saw as biblical Christianity.

The ''[[Magdeburg Centuries]]'' was a work of ecclesiastical history compiled by [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] scholars and published between 1559 and 1574. Devoting a volume to each century, it covered the first thirteen centuries of Christianity up to 1298. The work was virulently anti-Catholic. Identifying the [[Papacy]] as the [[Antichrist]], it painted a &quot;dark&quot; picture of church history after the 5th century, characterizing it as &quot;increments of errors and their corrupting influences&quot;.

===Baronius===
In response to the Protestants, Roman Catholics developed a counter-image, depicting the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not &quot;dark&quot; at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. ISBN 1-56585-827-1. &quot;Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who kept theology in the background and produced a work that the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as &quot;far surpassing anything before his day&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911: [http://www.1911encyclopedia.com/History &quot;History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as &quot;the greatest history of the Church ever written&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'', covering the first twelve centuries of Christianity up to 1198, was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term &quot;dark age&quot; for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888&lt;ref&gt;Baronius's actual starting-point for the &quot;dark age&quot; was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (&quot;Saeculum Obscurum&quot;)], have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the &quot;lack of writers&quot; that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first inklings of the [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:
{{quote|The new age (''saeculum'') which was beginning, for its harshness and barrenness of good could well be called iron, for its baseness and abounding evil leaden, and moreover for its lack of writers (''inopia scriptorum'') dark (''obscurum'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesar Baronius|Baronius, Caesar]] (1602). ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, p. 647. &quot;Novum incohatur saeculum quod, sua asperitate ac boni sterilitate ferreum, malique exudantis deformitate plumbeum, atque inopia scriptorum, appellari consuevit obscurum.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Significantly, Baronius termed the age &quot;dark&quot; because of the paucity of written records capable of throwing light on it for the historian. The &quot;lack of writers&quot; he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called &quot;dark&quot;) with the number of volumes containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. (Of course, only a minority of these writers were historians.)

There is a sharp drop from 33 volumes in the 9th century to just 7 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 12 volumes, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 39, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 25 volumes, fails to do. There was indeed a &quot;dark age&quot;, in Baronius's sense of a &quot;lack of writers&quot;, between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, besides the &quot;dark age&quot; named by Baronius, there was an earlier one, for regarding &quot;lack of writers&quot; the 7th and 8th centuries are pretty much on a par with the 10th. In short, in Western Europe during the 1st millennium, two &quot;dark ages&quot; can be identified, separated by the brilliant but all too brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

Baronius's &quot;dark age&quot; seems to have struck historians as something they could use, for it was in the 17th century that the terms &quot;dark age&quot; and &quot;dark ages&quot; started to proliferate in the various European languages, with his original Latin term, &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot;, being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some historians, following Baronius's lead, used &quot;dark age&quot; neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others, in the manner of the early humanists and Protestants (and later the Enlightenment writers and their successors right up to the present day) used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of neutrality and objectivity that has quite spoilt the term for many modern historians.

The first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form &quot;darker ages&quot;, which appears several times in his work in the last quarter of the 17th century. His earliest use of it seems to have been in 1679 in the &quot;Epistle Dedicatory&quot; to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', where he writes: &quot;The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it again in 1682 in Volume II of the ''History'', where he dismisses the story of &quot;St George's fighting with the dragon&quot; as &quot;a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet was a Protestant bishop chronicling how England became Protestant and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.

===Enlightenment===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or &quot;Age of Faith&quot;, was therefore the polar opposite of the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). &quot;Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World&quot;, in ''Medieval Panorama''. ISBN 0-89236-642-7. &quot;Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]], among others, were vocal in attacking the religiously dominated Middle Ages as a period of social regress, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the &quot;rubbish of the Dark Ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself on the threshold of a &quot;new age&quot;, was criticizing the centuries until his own time, so too were the Enlightenment writers criticizing the centuries until their own. These extended well after Petrarch's time, since religious domination and conflict were still common into the 17th century and beyond, albeit diminished in scope.

Consequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark had been expanded in time, implicitly at least. Even if the early humanists after him no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period covered by their own condemnation had been stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievements, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.

In spite of this, the term &quot;Middle Ages&quot;, used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was the name in general use before the 18th century to denote the period until the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word &quot;medieval&quot; was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century, it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this medieval period. The earliest entry for a capitalised &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or to extend through the rest of the 1st millennium.

===Romanticism===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics and launched a vogue for [[medievalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[Goths|Gothic]]&quot; had been a term of opprobrium akin to &quot;[[Vandal]]&quot; until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English &quot;Goths&quot; like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This sparked off an interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following Romantic generation began to take on an idyllic image of the &quot;Age of Faith&quot;. This image, in reaction to a world dominated by Enlightenment rationalism in which reason trumped emotion, expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with romantic [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and sterile [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the emerging [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantics' view of these earlier centuries can still be seen in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with costumes and events.

Just as Petrarch had turned the meaning of light versus darkness, so had the Romantics turned the judgment of Enlightenment critics. However, the period idealized by the Romantics focused largely on what is now known as the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this was a reversal of the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the universal power and prestige of the Church was at its height. To many users of the term, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the earlier centuries after the fall of Rome.

==Modern academic use==
In the 19th century, the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was widely used by historians. In 1860, as John Barber notes, [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' &quot;formulated the classic contrast between the medieval period as the 'dark ages' and the achievements of the Renaissance as a period of revived antiquity that included literature, elegance and erudition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, and with it a calling into question of the terminology of darkness,&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; or at least of its pejorative use. Historian [[Denys Hay]] exemplified this when he spoke ironically of &quot;the lively centuries which we call dark&quot;.&lt;!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is used by historians today, therefore, it is intended to be neutral, namely, to express the idea that the events of the period often seem &quot;dark&quot; to us because of the paucity of historical records compared with both earlier and later times.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; The term is used in this sense (often in the singular) to reference the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the subsequent [[Greek Dark Ages]],&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; the [[dark ages of Cambodia]] (c. 1450-1863), and also a hypothetical [[Digital Dark Age]] which would ensue if the [[electronic document]]s produced in the current period were to become unreadable at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081027174646 'Digital Dark Age' May Doom Some Data], ''[[Science Daily]]'', October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Byzantinist]]s have used the term &quot;Byzantine Dark Ages&quot; to refer to the period from the earliest [[Muslim conquests]] to about 800,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lemerle|Lemerle, Paul]] (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; because there are no extant historical texts in Greek from this period, and thus the history of the Byzantine Empire and formerly Byzantine territories that were conquered by the Muslims is poorly understood and must be reconstructed from other types of contemporaneous sources, such as religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Whitby|Whitby, Michael]] (1992). &quot;Greek historical writing after Procopius&quot; in ''Byzantine and Early Islamic Near East'', ed. Averil Cameron and Lawrence I. Conrad, Princeton, p. 25-80.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that very few Greek manuscripts were copied in this period, indicating that the 7th and 8th centuries, which were a period of crisis for the Byzantines because of the Muslim conquests, were also less intellectually active than other periods.&lt;ref&gt;Lemerle, Paul (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, p. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;dark age&quot; is not restricted to the discipline of history. Since the archaeological evidence for some periods is abundant and for others scanty, there are also archaeological dark ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1320349/ Project: Exploring the Early Holocene Occupation of North-Central Anatolia: New Approaches for Studying Archaeological Dark Ages] Period of Project: 09/2007-09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Late Middle Ages]] significantly overlap with the [[Renaissance]], the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; has become restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe. Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], at the height of the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasions, have been called &quot;the darkest of the Dark Ages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] and Griffiths, Ralph (2000). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)'', 2nd Revised edition. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, p. 1. The first chapter opens with the sentence: &quot;In the darkest of the Dark Ages, the fifth and sixth centuries, there were many kings in Britain but no kingdoms.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in view of the societal collapse that characterized the period and the consequent lack of historical records compared with either the Roman era before or the centuries that followed. Further south and east, the same was true in the formerly Roman province of [[Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, this usage of the term must also differentiate geographically. While Petrarch's concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, the use of the term today applies mainly to those cultures and periods in Europe least Christianized and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, nearly all written by Catholic clergy at this date.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

However, from the mid-20th century onwards, other historians became critical of even this nonjudgmental use of the term for two main reasons.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; First, it is questionable whether it is possible to use the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; effectively in a neutral way; scholars may intend this, but it does not mean that ordinary readers will so understand it. Second, the explosion of new knowledge and insight into the history and culture of the Early Middle Ages, which 20th-century scholarship has achieved,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Martin (1993). ''[http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-00894-6.html Discovering Anglo-Saxon England]''. University Park, PA: Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt; means that these centuries are no longer dark even in the sense of &quot;unknown to us&quot;. To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians avoid it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151663/Dark-Ages Encyclopædia Britannica] &quot;It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term's more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians who use the term usually flag it as incorrect. A recently published history of German literature describes &quot;the dark ages&quot; as &quot;a popular if ignorant manner of speaking&quot; about &quot;the mediaeval period&quot;, but then immediately (in the next sentence) goes on to use the term &quot;dark age&quot; to mean &quot;little studied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dunphy, Graeme (2007). &quot;Literary Transitions, 1300–1500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern&quot; in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: &quot;Early Modern German Literature&quot;.  The chapter opens with the words: &quot;A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as &quot;the dark ages.&quot; If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Blütezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. it may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular use==
{{Further|Medievalism}}

[[Middle Ages in film|Films]] and novels often use the term &quot;Dark Age&quot; with its implied meaning of a time of backwardness. The 2007 television show ''The Dark Ages'' from [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] called the Dark Ages &quot;600 years of degenerate, godless, inhuman behavior&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/marquee.do?marquee_id=53127 ''The Dark Ages''] from [http://www.history.com/ the History Channel].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational thought and the study of nature===

{{further|Science in the Middle Ages}}
The medieval period is frequently caricatured as supposedly a &quot;time of ignorance and superstition&quot; which placed &quot;the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, &quot;The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor&quot;, in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationality was increasingly held in high regard as the Middle Ages progressed. The historian of science [[Edward Grant]], writes that &quot;If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century]&lt;!--original quotation says: &quot;expressed in the Age of Reason&quot;--&gt;, they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(p. 9) Edward Grant: God and Reason in the Middle Ages, Cambridge 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] says that, contrary to common belief, &quot;the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the essay of Ted Peters about Science and Religion at &quot;Lindsay Jones (editor in chief). Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition. Thomson Gale. 2005. p.8182&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The caricature of the period is also reflected in a number of more specific notions. For instance, a claim that was first propagated in the 19th century&lt;ref name=bunk&gt;Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], in his book ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]'' &quot;... shows how nineteenth-century anti-Christians invented and spread the falsehood that educated people in the Middle Ages believed that the earth was flat&quot; [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html Russell's summary of his book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flat&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

This claim is mistaken.&lt;ref name=&quot;flat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth notes that &quot;since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth.&quot; Klaus Anselm Vogel, [http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/diss/2000/vogel/index.htm#inhalt &quot;''Sphaera terrae'' - das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution&quot;], PhD dissertation, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, lecturers in the [[medieval universities]] commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;E. Grant, ''Planets. Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200-1687'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1994), pp. 626-630.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg and [[Ronald Numbers]] write: &quot;There was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lindberg | first = David C. | author-link = David C.

Other misconceptions such as: &quot;the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages&quot;, &quot;the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science&quot;, and &quot;the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy&quot;, are all cited by Ronald Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; They help maintain the idea of a &quot;Dark Age&quot; spanning through the medieval period.

Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;P Prioreschi 2001&quot;&gt;P Prioreschi, Determinants of the revival of dissection of the human body in the Middle Ages', Medical Hypotheses (2001) 56(2), 229–234)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'In the 13th century, the realisation that human anatomy could only be taught by dissection of the human body resulted in its legalisation in several European countries between 1283 and 1365' Philip Cheung 'Public Trust in Medical Research?.', (2007), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Indeed, very early in the thirteenth century, a religious official, namely, Pope Innocent III (1198-1216), ordered the postmortem autopsy of a person whose death was suspicious', Toby Huff, 'The Rise Of Modern Science' (2003), page 195&lt;/ref&gt;  It has even been suggested that the Christian theology contributed significantly to the revival of human dissection and autopsy by providing a new socio-religious and cultural context in which the human [[cadaver]] was no longer seen as sacrosanct.&lt;ref name=&quot;P Prioreschi 2001&quot;/&gt;
