'''Mesoamerica''' ({{lang-es|Mesoamérica}}) is a [[region]] and [[cultural area]] in the [[Americas]], extending approximately from central [[Mexico]] to [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and northern [[Costa Rica]], within which a number of [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian societies]] flourished before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meso-America.&quot;  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Reference Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed. (rev.)  2002. (ISBN 0-19-860652-4) Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2000): Atlas del México Prehispánico. Revista Arqueología mexicana. Número especial 5. Julio de 2000. Raíces/ Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. México.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its indigenous cultures. Beginning as early as 7000 BC the domestication of [[maize]], [[phaseolus|beans]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]], as well as the [[Meleagris gallopavo|turkey]] and [[Xoloitzcuintle|dog]], caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex  [[Mesoamerican religion|mythological and religious tradition]], a [[vigesimal]] numeric system, and a [[Mesoamerican calendar|complex calendric system]], a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|tradition of ball playing]], and a distinct [[Mesoamerican architecture|architectural style]], were diffused through the area. Also in this period villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[jade]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[cinnabar]], [[Spondylus]] shells, [[hematite]], and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the wheel and basic metallurgy, neither of these technologies became culturally important.{{full}}

Among the earliest complex civilizations was the [[Olmec]] culture which inhabited the Gulf coast of Mexico and extended inland and southwards across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in Chiapas, Guatemala and Oaxaca laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. This formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.  In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]], complex urban polities began to develop among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] with the rise of centers such as [[El Mirador]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Tikal]] and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] at [[Monte Albán]]. During this period the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]]. Mesoamerica is one of only five regions of the world where writing was independently developed. In Central Mexico, the height of the Classic period saw the ascendancy of the city of [[Teotihuacan]], which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and northward. Upon the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 AD, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period the [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-Classic period Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a [[tributary states|tributary]]  empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.{{full}}

The distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century, and over the next centuries Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican  cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica, many of whom continue to speak their ancestral languages, and even maintain certain cultural practices harking back to their Mesoamerican roots.{{full}}

==Etymology and definition==
[[File:ES JoyadeCeren 06 2011 Estructura 9 Area 2 Tamazcal 2106.jpg|thumb|right|Temazcal in [[Joya de Ceren]], is an archaeological site in El Salvador featuring a pre-Columbian Maya farming village preserved remarkably intact under layers of volcanic ash. It is often referred to as the &quot;Pompeii of the Americas&quot; in comparison to the famous Ancient Roman ruins. Even more important than the buildings, however, are the [[Paleoethnobotany|paleoethnobotanical]] remains. Of great importance is the discovery of manioc fields, the first time manioc cultivation had been found at a [[New World]] archaeological site.

The term ''Mesoamerica''—literally, &quot;middle America&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]]—was first used by the [[Germany|German]] [[ethnologist]] [[Paul Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mesoamerica: Our Region | work = Mesoamerica | url =  http://www.mesoamerica.com/ing_nuestra_region.shtml | accessdate = 2006-12-19 | quote = Paul Kirchhoff coined the term ''Mesoamerica'' in 1943 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:meso-|mesos]]'' or &quot;center&quot; and ''[[Americas|America]]'' from [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who claimed to have discovered the [[continent]] ([[Christopher Columbus]] thought he had reached [[Asia]]).}}&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that similarities existed among the various [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian cultures]] within the region that included southern [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], western [[Honduras]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] lowlands of [[Nicaragua]] and northwestern [[Costa Rica]].  In the tradition of [[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural history]], the prevalent [[archaeological theory]] of the early to middle 20th century, Kirchhoff defined this zone as a cultural area based on a suite of interrelated cultural similarities brought about by millennia of inter- and intra-regional interaction (i.e., [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion)]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, Paul (1943). &quot;Mesoamérica. Sus Límites Geográficos, Composición Étnica y Caracteres Culturales&quot;. Acta Americana 1 (1): 92–107.[https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3gZopBqNmppYTU2NDJiMjYtNDdiNC00MjJmLTg3ZDUtYWMxMTA3OTEwYmY0&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1]{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared cultural traits that define Mesoamerica are: 
*[[Sedentism]] based on [[maize]] [[agriculture]]
* The construction of [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Stepped pyramids]]
* The use of two different [[Mesoamerican calendar|calendar]]s (a 260-day ritual calendar and a 365-day calendar based on the [[solar year]])
*[[vigesimal]](base 20) number system
*[[pictogram|Pictographic]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing system]]s
*The use of [[rubber]] and [[Amate|bark paper]]
*The practice of various forms of [[sacrifice]] including [[Human sacrifice]]
*A [[Mesoamerican religion|religious complex]] based on a combination of [[Shamanism]] and natural deities

Mesoamerica has also been shown to be a [[Sprachbund|linguistic area]] defined by a [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area|number of grammatical traits]] that have spread through the area by diffusion. 

Mesoamerica is recognized as a near-prototypical cultural area and the term is now fully integrated in the standard terminology of pre-Columbian [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] studies.  Conversely, the sister terms [[Aridoamerica]] and [[Oasisamerica]], which refer to northern Mexico and the western [[United States]], respectively, have not entered into widespread usage.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Puebla farmers.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Landscape of the Mesoamerican highlands]]
Located on the [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] [[isthmus]] joining North and [[South America]] between ''ca.'' 10° and 22° northern [[latitude]], Mesoamerica possesses a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts.  [[archaeology|Archaeologist]] and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Michael D. Coe]] groups these different [[ecological niche|niche]]s into two broad categories{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}: the lowlands (those areas between [[sea level]] and 1000 meters) and the ''altiplanos'', or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level). In the low-lying regions, [[subtropical climate|sub-tropical]] and [[tropical climate]]s are most common, as is true for most of the coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold [[mountain climate|mountainous climates]]; the dominant climate is [[temperateness|temperate]] with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry [[Oaxaca]] and north [[Yucatan]] to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.

===Cultural sub-areas===
There are a number of distinct sub-regions within Mesoamerica that are defined by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes.  These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid.  The Maya area, for example, can be divided into two general groups: the lowlands and highlands.  The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands.  The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern [[Guatemala]], southern [[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]] in [[Mexico]], and [[Belize]].  The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].  Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, [[Oaxaca]], the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern [[Honduras]]).

===Topography===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guatemalahighlands.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] in [[Guatemala]], showing the [[Volcán Atitlán|Atitlán]] and [[Volcán San Pedro|San Pedro]] volcanoes]] --&gt;
There is extensive topographic variation in Mesoamerica, ranging from the high peaks circumscribing the [[Valley of Mexico]] and within the central [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains to the low flatlands of the northern Yucatán Peninsula.  The tallest mountain in Mesoamerica is [[Pico de Orizaba]], a [[dormant volcano]] located on the border of [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]].  Its peak elevation is 5,636&amp;nbsp;m (18,490&amp;nbsp;ft). 

The Sierra Madre mountains, which consist of a number of smaller ranges, run from northern Mesoamerica south through [[Costa Rica]].  The chain is historically [[Volcano|volcanic]].  In central and southern Mexico, a portion of the Sierra Madre chain is known as the [[Eje Volcánico Transversal]], or the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt.  There are 83 inactive and active volcanoes within the Sierra Madre range, including 11 in Mexico, 37 in Guatemala, 23 in El Salvador, 25 in Nicaragua, and 3 in northwestern Costa Rica.  According to the Michigan Technological University [http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/world.html], 16 of these are still active.  The tallest active volcano is [[Popocatépetl]] at 5,452&amp;nbsp;m (17,887&amp;nbsp;ft).  This volcano, which retains its [[Nahuatl]] name, is located 70&amp;nbsp;km (43&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Mexico City]].  Other volcanoes of note include [[List of mountains|Tacana]] on the Mexico–Guatemala border, [[Volcán Tajumulco|Tajumulco]] and [[Santamaría (volcano)|Santamaría]] in Guatemala, [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] in El Salvador, [[Momotombo]] in Nicaragua, and [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]] in Costa Rica.

One important topographic feature is the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north and the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] to the south.  At its highest point, the [[Isthmus]] is 224&amp;nbsp;m (735&amp;nbsp;ft) above mean sea level.  This area also represents the shortest distance between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] in Mexico.  The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200&amp;nbsp;km (120&amp;nbsp;mi).  Although the northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered with dense jungle, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.

===Bodies of water===
Outside of the northern Maya lowlands, [[river]]s are common throughout Mesoamerica.  A number of the more important ones served as loci of human occupation in the area.  The longest river in Mesoamerica is the [[Usumacinta]], which forms in Guatemala at the convergence of the [[Salinas River (Guatemala)|Salinas]] or [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]] and La [[Pasion River]] and runs north for 970&amp;nbsp;km (600&amp;nbsp;mi)—480&amp;nbsp;km (300&amp;nbsp;mi) of which are navigable—eventually draining into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  Other rivers of note include the [[Rio Grande de Santiago]], the [[Grijalva River]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Ulúa River]], and the [[Hondo River (Belize)|Hondo River]].  The northern Maya lowlands, especially the northern portion of the Yucatán peninsula, are notable for their nearly complete lack of rivers (largely due to the absolute lack of topographic variation).  Additionally, no lakes exist in the northern peninsula. The main source of water in this area is [[aquifer]]s that are accessed through natural surface openings called [[cenote]]s.  

With an area of 8,264&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,191&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), [[Lake Nicaragua]] is the largest lake in Mesoamerica.  [[Lake Chapala]] is Mexico’s largest freshwater lake, but [[Lake Texcoco]] is perhaps most well known as the location upon which [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]], was founded.  [[Lake Petén Itzá]], in northern Guatemala, is notable as the location at which the last independent Maya city, [[Tayasal]] (or Noh Petén), held out against the Spanish until 1697.  Other large lakes include [[Lake Atitlán]], [[Lake Izabal]], [[Geography of El Salvador|Lake Güija]], [[Lemoa]], and [[Lake Managua]].

===Biodiversity===
Almost all [[ecosystem]]s are present in Mesoamerica; the more well known are the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]], the second largest in the world, and La Mosquitia (consisting of the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve, Tawahka Asangni, Patuca National Park, and Bosawas Biosphere Reserve) a [[rainforest]] second in size in the Americas only to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm Science Show – 19 August 2006 – Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The highlands present [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|mixed]] and [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest. The biodiversity is among the richest in the world, although the number of species in the red list of the [[IUCN]] is growing every year.

==Chronology and culture==
{{main|Mesoamerican chronology}}
The history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided among a number of stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the [[Paleo-Indian]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] (or Formative), the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic]], and the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]]. The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is lumped into the Colonial period.   

The differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Late Preclassic]]) generally reflects [[Sociocultural evolution|different configurations of socio-cultural organization]] that are characterized by [[Society#Evolution of societies|increasing socio-political complexity]], the adoption of new and different [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic]] period through the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.

===Paleo-Indian===
The Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous [[North America]], was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian.  Evidence for this time period in Mesoamerica is sparse and the documented sites scattered c. 10,500 BC.  These include [[Chivacabé]], [[Los Tapiales]], and [[Puerta Parada]] in the highlands of Guatemala, [[Orange Walk (archaeological site)|Orange Walk]] in Belize, and the El Gigante cave in Honduras. {{citation needed|date=February 2007}} These latter sites had a number of [[obsidian]] blades and [[Clovis point|Clovis]]-style fluted [[projectile point]]s. Fishtail points, the most common style in [[South America]], were recovered from Puerta Parada, dated to c. 10,000 BC, as well as other sites including [[Los Grifos]] cave in [[Chiapas]] (c. 8500 BC) and [[Iztapan]] (c. 7700–7300 BC), a [[mammoth]] kill site located in the Valley of Mexico near [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]].{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Archaic===
The Archaic period (8000–2000 BC) is characterized by the rise of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|incipient agriculture]] in Mesoamerica.  The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with [[sedentism]] and agricultural production by the close of the period.  Archaic sites include ''[[Sipacate]]'' in [[Escuintla]], Guatemala, where maize [[pollen analysis|pollen samples]] date to c. 3500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The well-known [[List of caves in Mexico|Coxcatlan cave]] site in the Valley of [[Tehuacán]], [[Puebla]], which contains over 10,000 [[teosinte]] cobs (an antecedent to [[maize]]), and [[List of caves in Mexico|Guila Naquitz]] in Oaxaca represent some of the earliest examples of agriculture in Mesoamerica.  The early development of pottery, often seen as a sign of sedentism, has been documented at a number of sites, including the West Mexican sites of [[Matanchén]] in [[Nayarit]] and Puerto Marqués in [[Guerrero]].  [[La Blanca]], [[Ocós]], and [[Ujuxte]] in the [[Guatemala#Geography|Pacific Lowlands]] of [[Guatemala]] yielded pottery dated to c. 2500 BC. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Preclassic/Formative===
{{see also|Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures}}

[[File:Elmiradortigre.jpg|right|250px|thumb| [[El Mirador]] flourished from 600 BCE to 100 AD, may have had a population of over 100,000. ]]

The first complex civilization to develop in Mesoamerica was that of the [[Olmec]], who inhabited the gulf coast region of [[Veracruz]] throughout the Preclassic period.  The main sites of the Olmec include [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]], [[La Venta]], and [[Tres Zapotes]].  Although specific dates vary, these sites were occupied from roughly 1200 to 400 BC. Remains of other early cultures interacting with the Olmec have been found at [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Izapa]], and [[Teopantecuanitlan]], and as far south as in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p,. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in the Pacific Lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala suggest that [[Izapa]] and the [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto Culture]] may have preceded the Olmec.  [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon samples]] associated with various sculptures found at the Late Preclassic site of [[Izapa]] suggest a date of between 1800 and 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-11.pdf]|10.1&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 10368 bytes --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Middle and Late Preclassic period witnessed the rise of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the southern Maya highlands and lowlands and at a few sites in the northern Maya lowlands.  The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BC, and include [[Nakbe]], [[El Mirador]], and [[Cerros]].  Middle to Late [[Preclassic Maya]] sites include [[Kaminaljuyú]], [[Cival]], [[Edzná]], [[Cobá]], [[Lamanai]], [[Komchen]], [[Dzibilchaltun]], and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], among others.

The Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], [[Tlatilco]], and [[Cuicuilco]].  These sites were eventually superseded by [[Teotihuacán]], an important Classic era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica.  The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly AD 50. 

In the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], [[San José Mogote]] represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive [[palisade]]s, ceremonial structures, the use of [[adobe]], and [[Mesoamerican writing systems#Zapotec writing|hieroglyphic writing]].  Also importantly, the site was one of the first to demonstrate [[ascribed status|inherited status]], signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure.  San José Mogote was eventual overtaken by [[Monte Albán]], the subsequent capital of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec empire]], during the Late Preclassic.

The Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], and [[Michoacán]] also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood.  This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the &quot;[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|shaft tomb tradition]]&quot;.

===Classic===

====Early Classic====
The Classic period is marked by the rise and dominance of several polities.  The traditional distinction between the Early and Late Classic are marked by their changing fortune and their ability to maintain regional primacy.  Of paramount importance are Teotihuacán in central Mexico and [[Tikal]] in Guatemala – indeed, the Early Classic’s temporal limits generally correlate to the main periods of these sites.  Monte Alban in Oaxaca is another Classic period polity that expanded and flourished during this period, but the Zapotec capital exerted less interregional influence than the other two sites.  

During the Early Classic, Teotihuacan participated in and perhaps dominated a far-reaching macro-regional interaction network.  Architectural and artifact styles (talud-tablero, tripod slab-footed ceramic vessels) epitomized at Teotihuacan were mimicked and adopted at many distant settlements.  [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Pachuca]] obsidian, whose trade and distribution is argued to have been economically controlled by Teotihuacan, is found throughout Mesoamerica. 

Tikal came to politically, economically, and militarily dominate much of the southern Maya lowlands during the Early Classic.  An exchange network centered at Tikal distributed a variety of goods and commodities throughout southeast Mesoamerica, such as obsidian imported from central Mexico (e.g., Pachuca) and highland Guatemala (e.g., [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], which was predominantly used by the Maya during the Early Classic), and [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] from the [[Motagua River|Motagua valley]] in Guatemala.  Carved inscriptions at the site attest to direct interaction with individuals adorned in Teotihuacan-styled dress c. 400 AD.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  However, Tikal was often in conflict with other polities in the [[Petén Basin]], as well as with others outside of it, including [[Uaxactun]], [[Caracol, Belize|Caracol]], [[Dos Pilas]], [[Naranjo]], and [[Calakmul]].  Towards the end of the Early Classic, this conflict lead to Tikal’s military defeat at the hands of Caracol in 562, and a period commonly known as the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal Hiatus]].

====Late Classic====
The Late Classic period (beginning ca. AD 600 until AD 909 [varies]) is characterized as a period of interregional competition and factionalization among the numerous regional polities in the Maya area.  This largely resulted from the decrease in Tikal’s socio-political and economic power at the beginning. It was during this time that a number of other sites, therefore, rose to regional prominence and were able to exert greater interregional influence, including Caracol, [[Copán]], [[Palenque]], and Calakmul (who was allied with Caracol and may have assisted in the defeat of Tikal), and [[Dos Pilas]] [[Aguateca]] and [[Cancuén]] in the [[Petexbatún]] region of Guatemala. Around 710 DC, Tikal arose again and started to build strong alliances and defeated its worst enemies.  In the Maya area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called [[Maya collapse|Maya &quot;collapse&quot;]], a transitional period coupling the general depopulation of the southern lowlands and development and florescence of centers in the northern lowlands.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Terminal Classic====
Generally applied to the Maya area, the Terminal Classic roughly spans the time between AD 800/850 and ca. AD 1000.  Overall, it generally correlates with the rise to prominence of [[Puuc]] settlements in the northern Maya lowlands, so named after the hills in which they are mainly found.  Puuc settlements are specifically associated with a unique architectural style (the &quot;Puuc architectural style&quot;) that represents a technological departure from previous construction techniques.  Major Puuc sites include [[Uxmal]], [[Sayil]], [[Labna]], [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], and [[Oxkintok]].  While generally concentrated within the area in and around the Puuc hills, the style has been documented as far away as at [[Chichen Itza]] to the east and [[Edzna]] to the south.

Chichén Itzá was originally thought to have been a Postclassic site in the northern Maya lowlands.  Research over the past few decades has established that it was first settled during the Early/Late Classic transition but rose to prominence during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic.  During its apogee, this widely known site economically and politically dominated the northern lowlands.  Its participation in the circum-peninsular exchange route, possible through its port site of [[Isla Cerritos]], allowed Chichén Itzá to remain highly connected to areas such as central Mexico and Central America.  The apparent “Mexicanization” of architecture at Chichén Itzá led past researchers to believe that Chichén Itzá existed under the control of a Toltec empire.  Chronological data refutes this early interpretation, and it is now known that Chichén Itzá predated the Toltec; Mexican architectural styles are now used as an indicator of strong economic and ideological ties between the two regions.

===Postclassic===
The Postclassic (beginning AD 900–1000, depending on area) is, like the Late Classic, characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities.  The main Maya centers were located in the northern lowlands.  Following Chichén Itzá, whose political structure collapsed during the Early Postclassic, [[Mayapán]] rose to prominence during the Middle Postclassic and dominated the north for c. 200 years.  After Mayapán’s fragmentation, political structure in the northern lowlands revolved around a number of large towns or city-states, such as [[Oxkutzcab]] and [[Ti’ho]] ([[Mérida, Yucatán]]), that competed with one another.  

[[Toniná]], in the Chiapas highlands, and [[Kaminaljuyú]] in the central Guatemala highlands, were important southern highland Maya centers.  The latter site, Kaminaljuyú, is one of the longest occupied sites in Mesoamerica and was continuously inhabited from c. 800 BC to around AD 1200.  Other important highland Maya groups include the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] of [[Utatlán]], the [[Mam people|Mam]] in [[Zaculeu]], the [[Poqomam language|Poqomam]] in [[Mixco Viejo]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] at [[Iximche]] in the Guatemalan highlands.  The [[Pipil people|Pipil]] resided in [[El Salvador]], while the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] were in eastern Guatemala and northwestern [[Honduras]].  

In central Mexico, the early portion of the Postclassic correlates with the rise of the [[Toltec]] and an empire based at their capital, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] (also known as [[Tollan]]).  [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], initially an important Early Classic center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, maintained its political structure (it did not collapse) and continued to function as a regionally important center during the Postclassic.  The latter portion of the Postclassic is generally associated with the rise of the [[Mexica]] and the [[Aztec empire]].  One of the more commonly known cultural groups in Mesoamerica, the Aztec politically dominated nearly all of central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, Mexico’s southern Pacific Coast (Chiapas and into Guatemala), Oaxaca, and [[Guerrero]].  

The [[Tarascan state|Tarascan]]s (also known as the [[P'urhépecha]]) were located in [[Michoacán]] and Guerrero.  With their capital at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the Tarascan state was one of the few to actively and continuously resist Aztec domination during the Late Postclassic.  Other important Postclassic cultures in Mesoamerica include the [[Totonac]] along the eastern coast (in the modern-day states of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]).  The [[Huastec people|Huastec]] resided north of the Totonac, mainly in the modern-day states of [[Tamaulipas]] and northern Veracruz.  The [[Mixtec]] and Zapotec cultures, centered at [[Mitla]] and [[Zaachila]] respectively, inhabited Oaxaca.  

The Postclassic ends with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] and their subsequent conquest of the Aztec between 1519 and 1521.  Many other cultural groups did not acquiesce until later.  For example, Maya groups in the Petén area, including the [[Itza]] at [[Tayasal]] and the [[Ko'woj]] at [[Zacpeten]], remained independent until 1697.  

Some Mesoamerican cultures never achieved dominant status or left impressive archeological remains but should be mentioned as noteworthy.  These include the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoque]] groups (which may or may not have been related to the Olmecs), the northern [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-aztecan]] groups, often referred to as the [[Chichimeca]], that include the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]], the Chontales, the Huaves, and the Pipil, Xincan and Lencan peoples of Central America.

==General characteristics==

=== Subsistence ===
{{main|Agriculture in Mesoamerica}}
{{see also|Maya diet and subsistence}}
[[File:Zea mays.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Examples of the diversity of [[maize]].]] 
By roughly 6000 BC, [[hunter-gatherer]]s living in the [[highland (geography)|highlands]] and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chiles.  The earliest example of [[maize]] comes from Guila Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca, that dates to c. 4000 BC.  It should be noted, however, that earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in [[Panama]], ca. 5500 BC {{PDFlink|[http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf]}}.  Slightly thereafter, other crops begin to be cultivated by the semi-[[agrarian]] communities throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (2005), p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although maize is the most common domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, [[jicama]], [[tomato]] and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC.  At the same time, [[cotton]], [[yucca]] and [[agave]] were exploited for fibers and [[textile]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (1999), pp.126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times.  The Ramón or [[Brosimum alicastrum|Breadnut tree]] (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'') was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour.  Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures.  Some of the main ones consumed include [[avocado]], [[papaya]], [[guava]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[Sapote|zapote]], and [[anona]].

Mesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large [[ungulate]]s—the lack of [[draft animals]] to assist in transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes.  Other animals, including the [[duck]], [[deer]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} [[dog]]s, and [[turkey]], were [[domestication|domesticated]].  Turkey was the first, occurring around 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;;Diamond (1999) p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogs, however, were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica,&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 45 (&quot;The only domestic animals were dogs – the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica  – and turkeys – understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.  

Societies of this region did hunt certain wild species to complement their diet.  These animals included deer, [[rabbit]], [[bird]]s and various types of insects.  They also hunted in order to gain luxury items such as cat fur and bird plumage.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican cultures that lived in the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures due to the fact that there was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (2005), p.25&lt;/ref&gt;  Fishing also was a major provider of food to lowland and coastal Mesoamericans creating a further disincentive to settle down in permanent communities.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Mesoamerican architecture}}

===Political organization===
[[File:ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[K'inich Kan B'alam II]], the Classic period ruler of [[Palenque]], as depicted on a [[stele]]]]

Ceremonial centers were the nuclei of Mesoamerican settlements.  The temples provided spatial orientation, which was imparted to the surrounding town. The cities with their commercial and religious centers were always political entities, somewhat similar to the European [[city-state]], and each person could identify himself with the city in which he lived.{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}

The ceremonial centers were always built to be visible. The pyramids were meant to stand out from the rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters.{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}  [[Stela]]e were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.

===Economy===
{{see also|Trade in Maya civilization}}

Given that Mesoamerica was broken into numerous and diverse ecological niches, none of the societies that inhabited the area were self-sufficient{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}.  For this reason, from the last centuries of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period onward, regions compensated for the environmental inadequacies by specializing in the extraction of certain abundant natural resources and then trading them for necessary unavailable resources through established commercial trade networks. 

The following is a list of some of the specialized resources traded from the various Mesoamerican sub-regions and environmental contexts:
* Pacific lowlands – [[cotton]] and [[cochineal]]
* Maya lowlands and the Gulf Coast – [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[jaguar]] skins, birds and bird feathers (especially [[quetzal]] and [[macaw]])
* Central Mexico – Obsidian ([[Pachuca]])
* Guatemalan highlands – Obsidian ([[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|San Martin Jilotepeque]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Ixtepeque]]), [[pyrite]], and [[jade]] from the [[Motagua River]] valley
* Coastal areas – [[salt]], dry [[fish]], [[Animal shell|shell]], and [[dye]]s

==Common characteristics of Mesoamerican culture==

===Calendrical systems===
{{main|Mesoamerican calendars}}
{{see also|Maya calendar|Aztec calendar}}
[[File:Maya days.jpg|250px|right|thumb|&quot;Head Variant&quot; or &quot;Patron Gods&quot; glyphs for Maya days]] Agriculturally-based people historically divide the year into four seasons. These included the two [[solstices]] and the two [[equinoxes]], which could be thought of as the four &quot;directional pillars&quot; that support the year. These four times of the year were, and still are, important as they indicate seasonal changes that directly impact the lives of Mesoamerican agriculturalists. 

The Maya closely observed and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and [[lunar eclipses]], the phases of the [[moon]], the periods of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events.  These tables are remarkably accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya [[astronomer]]s. {{PDFlink|[http://www.unm.edu/~abqteach/ArcheoCUs/99-01-08.pdf]|46.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 47982 bytes --&gt;}} 

Among the many types of calendars the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360 day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle and a venus cycle, which tracked the [[synodic]] period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa).  

The 260 cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260 day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns (Bernardino de Sahagun, Historia de las cosas de Nueva Espana. Diego Duran, The Book of The Gods and Rites, Oklahoma. The Books of [[Chilam Balam]] of Mani, Kaua, and Chumayel).

The names given to the days, months, and years in the Mesoamerican calendar came, for the most part, from animals, flowers, heavenly bodies and cultural concepts that held symbolic significance in Mesoamerican culture. This calendar was used throughout the history of Mesoamerican by nearly every culture.  Even today, several Maya groups in Guatemala, including the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] and [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], and the [[Mixe]] people of Oaxaca, continue using modernized forms of the Mesoamerican calendar.

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main|Mesoamerican writing systems}}
{{see also|Mesoamerican literature|Maya script}}
[[File:Tikalemblem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Maya script|emblem glyph]] of Tikal (Mutal).]] 

The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]] combining the use of [[logograms]] with a [[syllabary]], and they are often called [[hieroglyph]]ic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica but archaeological dating methods and a certain degree of self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]].  Others include the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Olmec]], Zapotec, and [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec/Isthmian]] writing systems.  An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into [[Latin script]].

The other [[glyph (archaeology)|glyph]]ic writing systems of Mesoamerica, and their interpretation, have been subject to much debate.  One important ongoing discussion regards whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts can be considered examples of true writing or whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts are best understood as [[pictographic]] conventions used to express ideas, specifically religious ones, but not representing the phonetics of the spoken language in which they were read. 

Mesoamerican writing is found in a number of different mediums, including large stone monuments such as [[stelae]], carved directly onto architecture, carved or painted over stucco (e.g., [[murals]]), and on [[pottery]]. No Precolumbian Mesoamerican society is known to have had widespread literacy, and literacy was probably restricted to particular social classes, including scribes, painters, merchants and the nobility.

The Mesoamerican book was typically written with brush and colored inks on a paper prepared from the inner bark of the ficus amacus. The book consisted of a long strip of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.

===The ballgame===
{{main|Mesoamerican ballgame}}
[[File:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A small ceremonial ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]].]]

The Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played for over 3000 years by nearly all pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, [[ulama (game)|ulama]], continues to be played in a few places.

Over 1300 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire, p. 98.  Note that slightly over 200 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have also been identified in the [[American Southwest]]. This total does not include those, since they are outside Mesoamerica, and there is discussion whether these areas were actually used for ballplaying.&lt;/ref&gt;  They vary considerably in size, but they all feature long narrow alleys with side-walls to bounce the balls against.

The rules of the ballgame are not known, but it was probably similar to volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4&amp;nbsp;kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.&lt;ref&gt;Filloy Nadal, page 30 as well as Leyenaar (2001) pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the game was played casually for simple recreation, including by children and perhaps even women, the game also had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice.

===Medicine and science===

====Arithmetic====
{{see also|Maya numerals}}

Mesoamerican [[arithmetic]] treated [[number]]s as having both literal and symbolic value, the result of the [[dualistic]] nature that characterized Mesoamerican ideology.{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}. As mentioned, the Mesoamerican numbering system was vigesimal (i.e., based on the number 20).  

In representing numbers, a series of bars and dots were employed.  Dots had a value of one, and bars had a value of five. This type of arithmetic was combined with a symbolic numerology: '2' was related to origins, as all origins can be thought of as doubling; '3' was related to household fire; '4' was linked to the four corners of the universe; '5' expressed instability; '9' pertained to the underworld and the night; '13' was the number for light, '20' for abundance, and '400' for infinity. The [[0 (number)|concept of zero]] was also used, and its representation at the Late Preclassic occupation of [[Tres Zapotes]] is one of the earliest uses of zero in human history.

===Mythology and worldview===
{{further|Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican creation myths|Mesoamerican world tree}}
{{see also|Aztec religion|Olmec mythology|Maya religion|Maya mythology}}

The shared traits in Mesoamerican mythology are characterized by their common basis as a religion that although in many Mesoamerican groups developed into complex polytheistic religious systems, retained some shamanistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano ''Aztec Medicine, Health, and Nutrition'' New Brunswick; Rutgers University Press. 1990, pp. 67–71 ISBN 0-8135-1563-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The great breadth of the Mesoamerican [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[deities]] is due to the incorporation of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature.  Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted, and represented in  anthropomorphic, [[zoomorphic]], and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects {{cite quote|date=May 2011}}.

The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed with the passage of time and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups.  The gods are at once three: creator, preserver and destroyer, and at the same time just one.  An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc. (European ideology, [[Manichaeism]]){{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}

The typical Mesoamerican cosmology sees the world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world wached by the moon.
More importantly, the three superposed levels of the world are united by a [[Ceiba]] tree (Yaxche' in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points.

Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus Mountains and tall trees connect the middle and upper worlds; caves connect the middle and the nether worlds.

====Sacrifice====
[[File:Human sacrifice (Codex Laud, f.8).png|thumb|Ritual human sacrifice portrayed in [[Codex Laud]]]]
Generally, sacrifice can be divided into two types: [[Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture|autosacrifice]] and [[human sacrifice]].  The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica.  In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life. {{Cite quote|date=May 2012}} Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention – to replenish the divine energy.

=====Autosacrifice=====
{{see also|Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|Sacrifice in Maya culture}}

Autosacrifice, also called [[bloodletting]], is the ritualized practice of drawing blood from oneself.  It is commonly seen or represented through iconography as performed by ruling elites in highly ritualized ceremonies, but it was easily practiced in mundane sociocultural contexts (i.e., non-elites could perform autosacrifice). The act was typically performed with [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s or [[stingray]] [[Stingray#Stinging mechanism|spines]], and blood was drawn from piercing or cutting the [[tongue]], [[earlobe]]s, and/or [[genitals]] (among other locations).  Another form of autosacrifice was conducted by pulling a rope with attached thorns through the tongue or earlobes.  The blood produced was then collected on paper held in a bowl.  

Autosacrifice was not limited to male rulers, as their female counterparts often performed these ritualized activities.  They are typically shown in performing the rope and thorns technique.  A recently discovered queen's tomb in the Classic Maya site of [[El Perú (Maya site)|Waka]] (also known as El Perú) had a ceremonial stingray spine placed in her genital area, suggesting that women also performed bloodletting in their genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040506073833.htm|title=Archaeologists Announce Discoveries At The Ancient Maya Site Of Waka' In Northern Guatemala|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Human Sacrifice=====
{{see also|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Sacrifice in Maya culture}}

Sacrifice had great importance in the social and religious aspects of Mesoamerican Culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine. {{Cite quote|date=May 2012}} Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, but it is not the end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life &amp;ndash; divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict.  The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice, and gives the gods the energy to go about their daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and the capturing of prisoners became a method of social advancement, and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests control the religious ideology, and the warriors supply the sacrifices.

====Astronomy====
Mesoamerican [[astronomy]] included a broad understanding of the cycles of planets and other celestial bodies. Special importance was given to the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[Venus]] as the morning and evening star.

Observatories were built at a number of sites, including the round observatory at [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and the “Observatorio” at [[Xochicalco]]. Often, the architectural organization of Mesoamerican sites was based on precise calculations derived from astronomical observations.  Well-known examples of these include the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] pyramid at Chichen Itza and the Observatorio at [[Xochicalco]].  A unique and common architectural complex found among many Mesoamerican sites are [[E-Group]]s, which are aligned so as to serve as astronomical observatories.  The name of this complex is based on [[Uaxactun]]’s “Group E,” the first known observatory in the Maya area.  Perhaps the earliest observatory documented in Mesoamerica is that of the [[Monte Alto culture]].  This complex consisted of 3 plain stelae and a temple oriented with respect to the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]].

====The symbolism of space and time====
[[File:Mexico0047.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Teotihuacan#Site layout|Avenue of the Dead]] in [[Teotihuacan]], an example of a Mesoamerican settlement planned according to concepts of directionality]]

It has been argued that among Mesoamerican societies the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]] are associated with the four [[cardinal points|cardinal compass points]] and linked together by the [[calendar]] (Duverger 1999). Dates or events were always tied to a compass direction, and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented with respect to directionality.  

In Maya cosmology, each cardinal point was assigned a specific color and a specific jaguar deity ([[Maya mythology#Bacabs|Bacab]]).  They are as follows:
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#H|Hobnil]]''' – Bacab of the [[East]], associated with the color red and the ''Kan'' years.
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#C|Can Tzicnal]]''' – Bacab of the [[North]], assigned the color white and the ''Muluc'' years,
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#Z|Zac Cimi]]''' – Bacab of the [[West]], associated with the color black and the ''Ix'' years.
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#H|Hozanek]]''' – Bacab of the [[South]], associated with the color yellow and the ''Cauac'' years.

Later cultures such as the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] and [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] maintain the association of cardinal directions with each color, but utilized different names.  

Among the Aztec, the name of each day was associated with a cardinal point (thus conferring symbolic significance), and each cardinal direction was associated with a group of symbols. Below are the symbols and concepts associated with each direction:
* '''East''' – [[crocodile]], the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[water]], cane, and movement. The East was linked to the world priests and associated with vegetative fertility, or, in other words, tropical exuberance.
* '''North''' – [[wind]], [[death]], the dog, the jaguar, and [[flint]] (or [[chert]]). The north contrasts the east in that it is conceptualized as dry, cold, and oppressive. It is considered to be the nocturnal part of the universe, and includes the dwellings of the dead. The dog ([[xoloitzcuintle]]) has a very specific meaning, as it is the one who accompanies the deceased during the trip to the lands of the dead and helps them cross the river of death that leads into nothingness. ''(See also [[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth]])''.
* '''West''' – the [[house]], the [[deer]], the [[monkey]], the [[eagle]], and [[rain]]. The west was associated with the cycles of vegetation, specifically the temperate high plains that experience light rains, and the change of seasons.
* '''South''' – [[rabbit]], the [[lizard]], dried [[herb]]s, the [[New World vulture|buzzard]], and [[flower]]s. It is related on the one hand to the luminous Sun and the noon heat, and on the other with rain filled with alcoholic drink. The rabbit, the principal symbol of the west, was associated with farmers and with [[pulque]].

===Political and religious art===
{{see also|Maya art}}
[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|250px|thumb|Art with ideological and political meaning: depiction of an [[Aztec]] ''[[tzompantli]]'' (skull-rack) from the [[Ramirez Codex]].]]
Mesoamerican [[art]]istic expression was conditioned by [[ideology]] and generally related to focusing on themes of [[religion]] and/or sociopolitical [[Power (sociology)|power]].  This is largely based on the fact that most works that survived the Spanish conquest were public monuments.  These monuments were typically erected by rulers who sought to visually legitimize their sociocultural and political position; by doing so, they intertwined their lineage, personal attributes and achievements, and legacy with religious concepts.  As such, these monuments were specifically designed for public display and took many forms, including [[stele]], [[sculpture]], architectural [[relief]]s, and other types of architectural elements (e.g., roofcombs).  Other themes expressed include tracking time, glorifying the city, and veneration of the gods—all of which were tied to explicitly aggrandizing the abilities and the reign of the ruler who commissioned the artwork.  

Other pre-Hispanic art was produced for inner, rather than outward, meaning. Its value relates not so much in what it visually depicts, but rather to what it represents.  Earthenware ([[ceramic]] vessels) are an example of this type of artistic expression, and were symbolic due to the origin of their source material; they were often in burial rituals and as the invisible faces of statues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
