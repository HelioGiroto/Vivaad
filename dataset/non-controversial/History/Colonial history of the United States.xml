The '''colonial history of the United States''' covers the history of [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]]s from the start of colonization of America until their incorporation into the United States.  In the late 16th century, [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern [[North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt; Small early attempts—such as the English [[Roanoke Colony#The Lost Colony|Lost Colony of Roanoke]]—often disappeared; everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high. Nevertheless successful colonies were established. European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups. No aristocrats settled permanently, but a number of adventurers, soldiers, farmers, and tradesmen arrived. Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of [[New Netherland]], the [[Swedish Americans|Swedes]] and [[Finnish American|Finns]] of [[New Sweden]], the English [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], the English [[Puritan]]s of [[New England]], the English settlers of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], and the &quot;worthy poor&quot; of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]], came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious, political and economic styles.  Occasionally one colony took control of another (during wars between their European parents). Only in [[Nova Scotia]] (now part of Canada) did the conquerors expel the previous colonists. Instead they all lived side by side in peace. There were no major civil wars among the 13&amp;nbsp;colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions (in [[Bacon's Rebellion|Virginia in 1676]] and in [[Leisler's Rebellion|New York in 1689–91]]) were short-lived failures.  Wars between the French and the British—the [[French and Indian Wars]] and [[Father Rale's War]]—were recurrent, and involved French-support for [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] attacks on the frontiers. By 1760 France was defeated and the British seized its colonies.

The four distinct regions were: [[New England]], the [[Middle Colonies]], the [[Chesapeake Bay Colonies]] (Upper South) and the [[Southern Colonies|Lower South]]. Some historians add a fifth region, [[American Frontier|the Frontier]], which was never separately organized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;&gt;Cooke, ed. ''North America in Colonial Times'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650, the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United States had been decimated by new diseases, introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors.&lt;ref name=&quot;middleton&quot;&gt;Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011) p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[timeline of Colonial America]] for list of historical events.

==Goals of colonization==
Colonizers came from European kingdoms with highly developed military, naval, governmental and entrepreneurial capabilities. The [[History of Spain|Spanish]] and [[History of Portugal|Portuguese]] centuries-old experience of conquest and colonization during the [[Reconquista]], coupled with new oceanic ship navigation skills, provided the tools, ability, and desire to colonize the New World. England, France and the Netherlands started colonies in both the West Indies and North America. They had the ability to build ocean-worthy ships, but did not have as strong a history of colonization in foreign lands as did Portugal and Spain. However, English entrepreneurs gave their colonies a base of merchant-based investment that needed much less government support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wallace Notestein]], ''English People on Eve of Colonization, 1603–30'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercantilism===
[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies from the 1660s. Mercantilism meant that the government and merchants based in England became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires and even merchants based in its own colonies. The government protected its London-based merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, especially by American merchants, some of whose activities (which included direct trade with the French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese) were classified as such by the [[Navigation Acts]]. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them.  Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755''  (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious persecution===
The prospect of religious persecution by authorities of the crown and the [[Church of England]] prompted a significant number of colonization efforts.  People fleeing persecution by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] were responsible for settling most of [[New England]], and the [[Province of Maryland]] was founded in part to be a haven for [[Roman Catholics]].

==Early colonial failures==
Numerous colonies failed in the beginning of the settlement era. The colonists faced high rates of death because of disease, starvation, inefficient resupply or wars with Indians or other European powers.

Spain had numerous failed attempts, including [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] in Georgia in 1526; [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] in Florida in 1528–36; [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] in West Florida 1559–61; [[Joara|Fort San Juan]] in North Carolina 1567–68; and the [[Ajacán Mission]] 1570–71, in Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt;

The French failed at [[Parris Island, South Carolina]] in 1562–63; [[Fort Caroline]], Florida, in 1564–65; [[Saint Croix Island, Maine]] 1604-5;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt; and [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis, Texas]] in 1685–89.

The most notable English failures were the &quot;[[Roanoke Colony|Lost Colony of Roanoke]]&quot; (1587–90) in [[North Carolina]] and [[Popham Colony]] in Maine (1607–8). It was at the Roanoke Colony that the first English child, [[Virginia Dare]], was born in the Americas; her fate is unknown.

==Spanish colonies==
At one time, Spain claimed and controlled North America west of the Mississippi and south of the Canadian border. Additionally, east of the Mississippi River, Spain claimed what is now the state of Florida and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.

===Florida===
{{Main|History of Florida}}
[[Spanish Empire|Spain]] established several small outposts in  Florida. The most important, [[St. Augustine, Florida]], founded in 1565, was repeatedly attacked and burned, but was the first permanent European settlement in what is now the continental United States.  Pirate attacks were unrelenting against small outposts as well as St. Augustine. The British and their colonies repeatedly made war with Spain and its colonies and outposts. South Carolina launched large scale raiding expeditions in the early 18th century, which effectively destroyed the [[Spanish missions in Florida|Spanish mission system]]. St. Augustine and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] survived, but English-allied Indians such as the [[Yamasee]] conducted slave raids throughout Florida, killing or [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|enslaving]] most of the region's natives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt;  In the mid-18th century, invading [[Seminoles]] from Georgia killed most of the remaining local Indians. Florida had about 3,000 Spaniards when Britain took control in 1763. Nearly all quickly left. Even though control was restored to Spain in 1783, Spain sent no more settlers or missionaries to Florida.  The inhabitants of [[West Florida]] revolted against the Spanish in 1810 and formed the [[Republic of West Florida]], which was quickly annexed by the United States.  The United States took possession of the remainder, [[East Florida]], in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gannon, ''The New History of Florida'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Mexico===
{{Main|History of New Mexico}}
Throughout the 16th century, Spain explored the southwest from Mexico with the most notable explorer being [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado|Francisco Coronado]] whose expedition rode throughout modern New Mexico and Arizona. The Spanish, moving north from Mexico, settled villages in the upper valley of the Rio Grande, including much of the western half of the present-day state of New Mexico. The capital was [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. Local Indians expelled the Spanish for 12 years following the [[Pueblo Revolt|Pueblo Revolt of 1680]]; they returned in 1692 in the &quot;bloodless&quot; reoccupation of Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;David Grant  Noble, ''Santa Fe: History of an Ancient City'' (2nd ed. 2008) ch 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Control was by Spain (223 years) and Mexico (25 years) until 1846, when the [[Army of the West (1846)|American Army of the West]] took over in the [[Mexican-American War]].  About of a third of the population in the 21st century descends from the Spanish settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;David J. Weber 2009&quot;&gt;David J. Weber, ''The Spanish Frontier in North America'' (2002), ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

{{further|Spanish missions in California|Territorial evolution of California}}
[[File:Mission San Juan Capistrano.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Spanish [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] in California.]]
Spanish explorers sailed along the coast of present day [[History of California to 1899|California]] from the early 16th century to the mid-18th century, but no settlements were established over those centuries.

Spain, from 1769 until the independence of Mexico in 1820, sent missionaries and soldiers to [[Alta California]] who created a series of missions operated by [[Franciscan]] priests. They also operated ''presidios'' (forts), ''pueblos'' (settlements)s, and [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] (land grant ranches), along the southern and central coast of California. Father [[Junípero Serra]], founded the first missions in Spanish upper ''[[Las Californias]]'', starting with [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]] in 1769. Through the Spanish and Mexican eras they eventually comprised a series of 21 missions to spread Christianity among the local Native Americans, linked by ''[[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]'' (&quot;The Royal Road&quot;). They were established to convert the [[indigenous peoples of California]], while protecting historic Spanish claims to the area. The missions introduced European technology, livestock, and crops. The [[Indian Reductions]] converted the native peoples into groups of [[Mission Indians]]; they worked as laborers in the missions and the ranchos. In the 1830s the missions were disbanded and the lands sold to Californios. The  [[Population of Native California|indigenous Native American population]] was around 150,000; the ''[[Californio]]s'' (Mexican era Californians) around 10,000; with the rest immigrant Americans and other nationalities involved in trade and business in California.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Chapman, ''A History of California: The Spanish Period'' (1991) ch 27-31 [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=90632678 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
{{Further|Spanish Texas|Mexican Texas|Spanish missions in Texas}}

==New France==
{{Main|New France|French colonization of the Americas}}
[[Image:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The 1750 possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange) in contrast to the borders of contemporary Canada and the United States.]]
New France was the vast area explored and [[French colonization of the Americas|claimed]] by France. It was composed of several  colonies.  They were [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île-Royale]] (present-day [[Cape Breton Island]]), and Île Saint Jean (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]).  Although all of these territories would come under British control in the 18th century, only portions of Canada, Acadia and Louisiana became parts of the United States.

===Pays d'en Haut===
By 1660, French fur trappers based in Montreal pushed west along the Great Lakes and founded [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[St. Ignace, Michigan|Saint Ignace]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Sainte Marie]], [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], and [[Detroit]] in 1701. By 1773, the population of Detroit was 1,400.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many roads to Red River'' (2001), p69&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the War for Independence in 1783, the region south of the Great Lakes formally became part of the United States.

===Illinois Country===
The [[Illinois country]] by 1752 had a population of 2,500; it was concentrated around [[Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia]], and [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Sainte Genevieve]].  According to one scholar, &quot;The Illinois Habitant was a gay soul; he seemed shockingly carefree to later, self-righteous puritans from the American colonies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Natalia Maree Belting|author2=Carl J. Ekberg|title=Kaskaskia Under the French Regime|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fdlw1wwPcYcC|year=2003|publisher=SIU Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana===
[[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], first settled at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1702, started its growth when 7,000 French immigrants arrived in [[New Orleans]] in 1718. There was little economic development because the city lacked a large hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Garretson Clark|title=New Orleans, 1718-1812: An Economic History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=auzR3dtjUFMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1970|publisher=Pelican Publishing|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas around New Orleans and west of the Mississippi were given to Spain in 1769.  Louisiana was taken back by France and sold to the United States in 1803 in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, ''The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Netherland==
{{Main|New Netherland|Dutch colonization of the Americas}}
{{New Netherland}}
[[Image:Castelloplan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1660]]
''Nieuw-Nederland'', or '''New Netherland''', chartered in 1614, was a colonial province of the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] in what became [[New York State]] and parts of [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware]]. The peak population was less than 10,000.  The Dutch established a [[patroon]] system with feudal-like rights given to a few powerful landholders; they also established religious tolerance and free trade. The colony's capital, [[New Amsterdam]], founded in 1625 and located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]], would grow to become a major world city. The city was captured by the English in 1664; they took complete control of the colony in 1674 and renamed it [[Province of New York|New York]].  However the Dutch landholdings remained, and the Hudson River Valley maintained a traditional Dutch character until the 1820s.;&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Kammen, ''Colonial New York: A History'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [http://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  ch. 1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
however, traces of Dutch influence, such as homes, family surnames, and the names of roads and whole towns remain in present-day northern New Jersey and south eastern New York State

==New Sweden==
{{Main|Swedish colonization of the Americas}}
[[Image:Kartskiss över Nya Sverige.png|thumb|Map of New Sweden by [[Amandus Johnson]]]]
'''New Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Nya Sverige}}) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] colony along the [[Delaware River Valley]] from 1638 to 1655. The few hundred settlers huddled around [[Fort Christina]].  It was captured by the Dutch in 1655 and merged into [[New Netherland]], and most traces of Swedish culture faded away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amandus Johnson]]  ''The Swedes on the Delaware'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian colonies==
{{Main|Russian Alaska|Russian colonization of the Americas}}
Russia explored the area that became Alaska starting with the [[Second Kamchatka expedition]] in the 1730s and early 1740s.  Their first settlement was founded in 1784 by [[Grigory Shelikhov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/intldl/mtfhtml/mfak/mfakrcol.html |title=Meeting of Frontiers: Alaska – The Russian Colonization of Alaska |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian-American Company]] was formed in 1799 with the influence of [[Nikolay Rezanov]] for the purpose of buying [[sea otter]]s for their fur from native hunters. In 1867 the U.S. [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] and nearly all Russians abandoned the area except a few missionaries of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] working among the natives.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft vol. 33: History of Alaska, 1730–1885'' (1886) [http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofalaska100banc/historyofalaska100banc_djvu.txt online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==English colonies==
{{See also|British America|Thirteen Colonies}}

[[Image:Wpdms king james grants.png|right|thumb|The 1606 grants by [[James I of England|James I]] to the London and Plymouth companies. The overlapping area (yellow) was granted to both companies on the stipulation that neither found a settlement within {{convert|100|mi|km}} of each other. The location of the Jamestown Settlement is shown by &quot;J&quot;]]
England made its first successful efforts at the start of the 17th century for several reasons. During this era, English proto-nationalism and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish invasion, assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy  of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. At this time, however, there was no official attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire. Rather, the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and variable. Practical considerations, such as commercial enterprise, overpopulation and the desire for freedom of religion, played their parts. The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century. After 1700 most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s—young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Moller, &quot;Sex Composition and Correlated Culture Patterns of Colonial America,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1945), pp. 113–153 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1923515 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to its American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;James Davie Butler, &quot;British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' 2 (October 1896): 12–33&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[convicts]] to arrive pre-dated the arrival of the ''[[Mayflower]]''.

===Chesapeake Bay area===
{{Main|Jamestown, Virginia|Colony of Virginia|Province of Maryland}}

====Virginia====
The first successful English colony was [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], established May 13, 1607 near [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The business venture was financed and coordinated by the [[London Virginia Company]], a joint stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to [[tobacco]] as a [[cash crop]]. By the late 17th century, Virginia's export economy was largely based on tobacco, and new, richer settlers came in to take up large portions of land, build large plantations and import indentured servants and slaves. In 1676, [[Bacon's Rebellion]] occurred, but was suppressed by royal officials. After Bacon's Rebellion, African [[slave trade|slaves]] rapidly replaced indentured servants as Virginia's main labor force.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;Alan Taylor, ''American Colonies,'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heinemann&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607–2007'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial assembly shared power with a royally appointed governor. On a more local level, governmental power was invested in county courts, which were self-perpetuating (the incumbents filled any vacancies and there never were popular elections). As cash crop producers, Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade with England. With easy navigation by river, there were few towns and no cities; planters shipped directly to Britain. High death rates and a very young population profile characterized the colony during its first years.&lt;ref name=&quot;heinemann&quot;/&gt;

===New England===
{{Main|History of New England|Connecticut Colony|Plymouth Colony|Massachusetts Bay Colony|Province of New Hampshire|Colony of Rhode Island}}

====Puritans====
{{Main|Puritan}}
The Puritans, a much larger group than the Pilgrims, established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620–1640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply.  The Massachusetts settlement spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies.  During the 17th century the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.

The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that still influences the modern United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Lee Tuveson, ''Redeemer nation: the idea of America's millennial role'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; They hoped this new land would serve as a &quot;[[redeemer nation]]&quot;. They fled England and in America attempted to create a &quot;nation of saints&quot; or a &quot;[[City upon a Hill]]&quot;: an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], who preached religious toleration, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England, was banished and founded [[Rhode Island Colony]], which became a haven for other refugees from the Puritan community, such as [[Anne Hutchinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, Puritan New England fulfilled the expectations of its founders. Unlike the cash crop-oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region, the Puritan economy was based on the efforts of self-supporting farmsteads who traded only for goods they could not produce themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Mackin, ''Americans and their land: the house built on abundance'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006) p 29&lt;/ref&gt; There was a generally higher economic standing and standard of living in New England than in the Chesapeake.  Along with agriculture, fishing, and logging, New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center, serving as the hub for trading between the southern colonies and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;&gt;James Ciment, ed. ''Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other New England====
The [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small Protestant sect based in England and the Netherlands. One group sailed on the ''[[Mayflower]]'' and settled in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] in 1620. After drawing up the [[Mayflower Compact]] by which they gave themselves broad powers of self-governance, they established the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. [[Providence Plantation]] was founded in 1636 by Rev. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] on land provided by the Narragansett sachem Canonicus. Williams, fleeing from religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, agreed with his fellow settlers on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule &quot;in civil things&quot; and &quot;liberty of conscience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;/&gt;

Other colonists who disagreed with Puritans in Massachusetts settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]].  These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679.  (Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.)

====Dominion of New England====
Under King [[James II of England]], the New England colonies (as well as New York and the Jerseys) were briefly united as the [[Dominion of New England]] (1686–89).  The administration eventually led by Governor Sir [[Edmund Andros]] seized colonial charters, revoked land titles, and ruled without local assemblies, causing anger among the population.  The [[1689 Boston revolt]], inspired by England's [[Glorious Revolution]] against James II, caused Andros, Boston Anglicans, and senior dominion officials to be arrested by the Massachusetts militia.  Andros was jailed for several months, then returned to England.  The Dominion of New England was dissolved and governments resumed under their earlier charters.&lt;ref&gt;James Truslow Adams, ''The founding of New England'' (1921) pp 398–431 [http://books.google.com/books?id=k4eo4r9BFdAC online]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Massachusetts charter had been revoked in 1684, and a new one was issued in 1691 that combined Massachusetts and Plymouth into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].  Although [[William III of England|King William III]] sought at least to unite the New England colonies militarily (for example, by appointing [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|the Earl of Bellomont]] to three simultaneous governorships, and military command over Connecticut and Rhode Island), these attempts at unified control failed.

===Middle Colonies===
{{Main|Middle Colonies}}

The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Delaware]], were characterized by a large degree of diversity—religious, political, economic, and ethnic. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] was taken over by the British and renamed New York but large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony.  New Jersey began as a division of New York, and was for a time divided into the proprietary colonies of [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey]]. Many [[German people|German]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants settled in these areas, as well as in [[Connecticut]]. A large portion of the settlers who came to Pennsylvania were German.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;/&gt;  Philadelphia became the center of the colonies; by the end of the colonial period 30,000 people lived there, having come from diverse nations and practicing numerous trades.

Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of the Quaker [[William Penn]].  It came to include the territory of Delaware, which had once been part of New Netherland; Delaware had a government independent of that established in Philadelphia, but was never [[Delaware Colony|a separate colony]].

===Lower South===
The colonial South included the plantation colonies of the Chesapeake region (Virginia, Maryland, and, by some classifications, Delaware) and the lower South (Carolina, which eventually split into North and South Carolina; and Georgia).&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;/&gt;

====Carolinas====
{{Main|Province of Carolina|Province of North Carolina|Province of South Carolina}}
The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the [[Province of Carolina]]. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]], who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area, a mission led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what was to become [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] (originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]]), thus beginning the English colonization of the mainland. The original settlers in South Carolina established a lucrative trade in provisions, deerskins and Indian captives with the Caribbean islands. The settlers came mainly from the English colony of [[Barbados]] and brought African slaves with them. Barbados, as a wealthy [[sugarcane]] plantation island, was one of the early English colonies to use large numbers of Africans in plantation style agriculture. The cultivation of [[rice]] was introduced during the 1690s via Africans from the rice-growing regions of [[Africa]]. North Carolina remained a frontier throughout the early colonial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;/&gt;

At first, South Carolina was politically divided. Its ethnic makeup included the original settlers, a group of rich, slave-owning [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from the island of Barbados; and [[Huguenots]], a [[French language|French]]-speaking community of Protestants. Nearly continuous frontier warfare during the era of [[King William's War]] and [[Queen Anne's War]] drove economic and political wedges between merchants and planters. The disaster of the 1715 [[Yamasee War]], which threatened the colony's viability, set off a decade of political turmoil. By 1729, the [[Proprietary Governor|proprietary government]] had collapsed, and the Proprietors sold both colonies back to the British crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;/&gt;

====Georgia====
{{Main|Province of Georgia}}

[[Image:SavannahColony.JPG|thumb|Savannah, [[Georgia Colony]], early 18th century]]
[[James Oglethorpe]], an 18th century British [[Member of Parliament]], established the [[Georgia Colony]] in 1733 as a common solution to two problems. At that time, tension between Spain and Great Britain was high, and the British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the British Carolinas. Oglethorpe decided to establish a colony in the contested border region of Georgia and populate it with debtors who would otherwise have been imprisoned according to standard British practice. This plan would both rid Great Britain of its undesirable elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida. The first colonists arrived in 1733.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciment&quot;/&gt;

Georgia was established on strict [[morality|moralistic]] principles. Slavery was forbidden, as were alcohol and other forms of supposed immorality. However, the reality of the colony was far from ideal. The colonists were unhappy about the puritanical lifestyle and complained that their colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice plantations. Georgia initially failed to prosper, but eventually the restrictions were lifted, slavery was allowed, and it became as prosperous as the Carolinas. The colony of Georgia never had a specific religion. It consisted of people of various faiths.

====East and West Florida====
{{Main|East Florida|West Florida}}
In 1763, Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain, which established the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. The Floridas remained loyal to Great Britain during the [[American Revolution]]. They were returned to Spain in 1783 (in exchange for the [[Bahamas]]), at which time most of the British left. The Spanish then neglected the Floridas: few Spaniards lived there when the US bought the area in 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke 1998&quot;/&gt;

==British colonial government==
Each colony had a paid [[colonial agent]] in London to represent its interests.

The three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial, proprietary, and charter.  These governments were all subordinate to the king in London, with no explicit relationship with the British [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].  Beginning late in the 17th century, the administration of all British colonies was overseen by a [[Board of Trade]].

===Provincial colonies===
New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and eventually Massachusetts, were provincial colonies.

The provincial government was governed by commissions created at pleasure by the monarch. A governor (and in some provinces his council) were appointed by the crown.  The governor was invested with general executive powers, and authorized to call a locally elected assembly.  The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session in addition to its role in advising the governor.  Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto, and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly.

The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England.  In practice this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown.  Laws could be examined by the Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation.

===Proprietary colonies===
Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies. They were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors, rather than the king, appointed the governor. They were set up after the [[English Restoration|Restoration of 1660]] and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty.&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [http://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charter colonies===
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, and Connecticut were charter colonies.  The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684, and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.

Charter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [http://books.google.com/books?id=2QIGe_0PYqsC  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political culture===
As Bonomi (1971) shows, the most distinctive feature of colonial society was the vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p 281&lt;/ref&gt;  First, suffrage was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689–1776'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  While fewer than 1% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. The roots of democracy were present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pole | first1 = J. R. | year = 1962 | title = Historians and the Problem of Early American Democracy | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 626–46 | doi = 10.2307/1844105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.&lt;ref&gt;Richard R. Beeman, &quot;The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America,&quot; ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311–340&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, in the colonies a very wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments in each colony.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp 281–2&lt;/ref&gt; They handled land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, ''Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies'' (1993) vol 1 pp 341–62, 391–402; 435–39&lt;/ref&gt; Americans sued each other at a very high rate, with binding decisions made not by a great lord but by local judges and juries. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, so that the intense involvement of lawyers in politics became an American characteristic by the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Anton-Hermann Chroust, ''The Rise of the Legal Profession in America: Volume 1, The Colonial Experience'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, the American colonies were exceptional in the world because of the representation of many different interest groups in political decision-making.  Unlike Europe, where aristocratic families and the established church were in control, the American political culture was open to economic, social, religious, ethnic and geographical interests, with merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]], Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groups taking part.  Elected representatives learned to listen to these interests because 90% of the men in the lower houses lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp 281–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the historiography, see Alan Tully, &quot;Colonial Politics,&quot; in Daniel Vickers ed.  ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (Blackwell, 2006) pp 288–310&lt;/ref&gt; Republicanism provided the framework for colonial resistance to British schemes of taxation after 1763, which escalated into the Revolution.

None of the colonies had stable political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power, especially in the perennial battles between the appointed governor and the elected assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, ''Peripheries and Center: Constitutional Development in the Extended Polities of the British Empire and the United States, 1607–1788'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  There were often &quot;country&quot; and &quot;court&quot; factions, representing those opposed and in favor, respectively, of the governor's actions and agenda.  Massachusetts, which from its 1691 charter had particularly low requirements for voting eligibility and strong rural representation in its assembly, also had a strong populist faction that represented the province's lower classes.

Up and down the colonies non-English ethnic groups had clusters of settlements.  The most numerous were the Scotch Irish&lt;ref&gt;James Graham Leyburn, ''The Scotch-Irish: A Social History'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Spencer Fogleman, ''Hopeful Journeys: German Immigration, Settlement and Political Culture in Colonial America, 1717–1775'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group assimilated into the dominant English, Protestant commercial and political culture, albeit with local variations. They tended to vote in blocs and politicians negotiated with group leaders for votes. They generally retained their historic languages and cultural traditions, even as they merged into the emerging American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, &quot;'Pluribus' or 'Unum?' White Ethnicity in the Formation of Colonial American Culture,&quot; ''History Now,'' 1998, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocultural factors were most visible in Pennsylvania. During 1756–76, the Quakers were the largest faction in the legislature, but they were losing their dominance to the emerging Presbyterian faction based on Scotch-Irish votes, supported by Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne L. Bockelman,  and Owen S. Ireland, &quot;The Internal Revolution in Pennsylvania: An Ethnic-Religious Interpretation,&quot; ''Pennsylvania History,'' March 1974, Vol. 41 Issue 2, pp 125–159
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unification of the British colonies==

===Colonial Wars: A common defense===
{{Main|Colonial American military history}}
Efforts at common defense of the colonies (principally against shared threats from Indians, the French, and the Dutch) began as early as the 1640s, when the Puritan colonies of New England formed [[New England Confederation|a confederation]] to coordinate military and judicial matters.  From the 1670s several royal governors, notably Sir [[Edmund Andros]] (who at various times governed New York, New England, and Virginia) and [[Francis Nicholson]] (governed Maryland, Virginia, Nova Scotia, and Carolina) proposed or attempted to implement means to coordinate defensive and offensive military matters.  After [[King Phillips War]], Andros successfully negotiated the [[Covenant Chain]], a series of Indian treaties that brought relative calm to the frontiers of the middle colonies for many years.

The northern colonies (particularly present-day [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]]) experienced numerous assaults from the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and the French from [[Acadia]] during the four [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]].
[[File:Louisbourg assiegee en 1745.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]] by [[Peter Monamy]]]]  

One event that reminded colonists of their shared identity as British subjects was the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748) in Europe. This conflict spilled over into the colonies, where it was known as &quot;[[King George's War]]&quot;. The major battles took place in Europe, but American colonial troops fought the French and their Indian allies in New York, New England, and Nova Scotia with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]].

At the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754, [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed that the colonies be united by a Grand Council overseeing a common policy for defense, expansion, and Indian affairs. While the plan was thwarted by colonial legislatures and [[George II of England|King George II]], it was an early indication that the British colonies of North America were headed towards unification.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====French and Indian War====
{{Main|French and Indian War}}
[[Image:WashingtonFIwar.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] during the [[French and Indian War]]]]
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s political cartoon calling for colonial unity during the French and Indian War; it would be used again during the American Revolution.]]
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]].  Although previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and then having spread to Europe. Increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley, was one of the primary origins of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson&quot;&gt;Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that, in order to win the war against France, major military resources needed to be devoted to North America. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a &quot;[[world war]]&quot;. During the war, the position of the British colonies as part of the [[British Empire]] was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans. The war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men, who might normally have never left their own colony, to travel across the continent, fighting alongside men from decidedly different, yet still &quot;American&quot;, backgrounds. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained American ones (most notably [[George Washington]]) for battle—which would later benefit the American Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson&quot;/&gt;  The relations between the British military establishment and the colonists were not always positive, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops.
[[Image:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|left|300px|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War: land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink.]]

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded the eastern part of its vast North American empire to Britain (having secretly given the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River to Spain the previous year). Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.

The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy, but after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson&quot;/&gt;

===Ties to the British Empire===
Although the colonies were very different from one another, they were still a part of the [[British Empire]] in more than just name.

Socially, the colonial elite of [[Boston]], New York, Charleston, and [[Philadelphia]] saw their identity as British. Although many had never been to Britain, they imitated British styles of dress, dance, and etiquette. This social upper echelon built its mansions in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]], copied the furniture designs of [[Thomas Chippendale]], and participated in the intellectual currents of Europe, such as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. To many of their inhabitants, the [[seaport]] cities of colonial America were truly British cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;vickers&quot;&gt;Daniel Vickers, ed. ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006), ch 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republicanism====
Many of the [[colonial government in America|political structures of the colonies]] drew upon the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] expressed by opposition leaders in Britain, most notably the [[Commonwealth men]] and the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] traditions. Many Americans at the time saw the colonies' systems of governance as modeled after the [[British constitution]] of the time, with the king corresponding to the governor, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to the [[colonial assembly]], and the [[House of Lords]] to the [[Governor's council]]. The codes of law of the colonies were often drawn directly from [[English and Welsh law|English law]]; indeed, English [[common law]] survives not only in Canada, but also throughout the United States. Eventually, it was a dispute over the meaning of some of these political ideals, especially [[political representation]], and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that led to the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967); Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consumption====
Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than different was the booming import of British goods. The British economy had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century, small factories in Britain were producing much more than the nation could consume. Finding a market for their goods in the British colonies of North America, Britain increased her exports to that region by 360% between 1740 and 1770. Because British merchants offered generous [[credit (finance)|credit]] to their customers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Americans began buying staggering amounts of British goods. From [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all British subjects bought similar products, creating and anglicizing a sort of common identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;vickers&quot;/&gt;

===Atlantic world===
In recent years historians have enlarged their perspective to cover the entire Atlantic world in a subfield now known as [[Atlantic history]].&lt;ref&gt;David Armitage and Michael J. Braddick, eds., ''The British Atlantic World, 1500–1800'' (2002);&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison. Games, &quot;Atlantic History: Definitions, Challenges, and Opportunities,&quot; ''American Historical Review,'' June 2006, Vol. 111 Issue 3, pp 741–757&lt;/ref&gt; Of special interest are such themes as international migration, trade, colonization, comparative military and governmental institutions, the transmission of religions and missionary work, and the slave trade. It was the [[Age of the Enlightenment]], and ideas flowed back and forth across the Atlantic, with Philadelphian [[Benjamin Franklin]] playing a major role. Warfare was critical, for as Furstenberg, (2008) explains, from 1754 to 1815, the major imperial players – Britain, the American colonies, Spain, France, the First Nations (Indians) and the United States fought a series of conflicts that can be called a &quot;Long War for the West&quot; over control of the region.&lt;ref&gt;François Furstenberg, &quot;The Significance of the Trans-Appalachian Frontier in Atlantic History,&quot; ''American Historical Review,'' June 2008, Vol. 113 Issue 3, pp 647–677,&lt;/ref&gt;

Women played a role in the emergence of the capitalist economy in the Atlantic world. The types of local commercial exchange in which they participated independently – especially markets in dairy and produce commodities – were well integrated with the trade networks between colonial merchants throughout the Atlantic region. For example, local women merchants were important suppliers of foodstuffs to transatlantic shipping concerns.&lt;ref&gt;James E.. McWilliams, &quot;Butter, Milk, and a 'Spare Ribb': Women's Work and the Transatlantic Economic Transition in Seventeenth-Century Massachusetts,&quot; ''New England Quarterly,'' March 2009, Vol. 82 Issue 1, pp 5–24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax protests lead to Revolution==
{{main|American Revolution}}
In the colonial era, Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen to have their own legislature raise all taxes.  Tax loads in practice were very light, and far lower than in England. Beginning in 1765 the British Parliament asserted its supreme authority to lay taxes, and a series of American protests began that led directly to the American Revolution. The first wave of protests attacked the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], and marked the first time Americans from each of the 13 colonies met together and planned a common front against illegal taxes.  The [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773 dumped British tea into Boston Harbor because it contained a hidden tax Americans refused to pay.  The British responded by trying to crush traditional liberties in Massachusetts, leading to the American revolution starting in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Slaughter, &quot;The Tax Man Cometh: Ideological Opposition to Internal Taxes, 1760–1790,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' Vol. 41, No. 4 (October 1984), pp. 566–591 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919154 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament attempted a series of taxes and punishments which met more and more resistance: First [[Quartering Act]] (1765); [[Declaratory Act]] (1766); [[Townshend Revenue Act]] (1767); and [[Tea Act]] (1773). In response to the Boston Tea Party Parliament passed the [[Intolerable Acts]]: Second [[Quartering Act]] (1774); [[Quebec Act]] (1774); [[Massachusetts Government Act]] (1774); [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] (1774); [[Boston Port Act]] (1774); [[Prohibitory Act]] (1775). By this point the 13 colonies had organized themselves into the [[Continental Congress]] and began setting up shadow governments and drilling their militia in preparation for war.&lt;ref&gt;Francis D. Cogliano, ''Revolutionary America, 1763–1815; A Political History'' (2nd ed. 2008) pp 49–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial life==

===New England===
In New England, the Puritans created self-governing communities of religious congregations of farmers, or [[yeoman|yeomen]], and their families. High-level politicians gave out plots of land to male settlers, or proprietors, who then divided the land amongst themselves. Large portions were usually given to men of higher social standing, but every white man—who wasn't indentured or criminally bonded—had enough land to support a family. Every male citizen had a voice in the town meeting. The town meeting levied taxes, built roads, and elected officials who managed town affairs.  The towns did not have courts—that was a function of a larger unit, the county, whose officials were appointed by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Lockridge, ''A New England Town, The First Hundred Years: Dedham, Massachusetts, 1636–1736'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregational Church]], the church the Puritans founded, was not automatically joined by all New England residents because of Puritan beliefs that [[God]] singled out specific people for salvation. Instead, membership was limited to those who could convincingly &quot;test&quot; before members of the church that they had been saved. They were known as &quot;the elect&quot; or &quot;Saints&quot; and made up less than 40% of the population of New England.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Conforti, ''Saints and Strangers: New England in British North America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farm life====
A majority of New England residents were small farmers. Within these small farm families, and English families as well, a man had complete power over the property and his wife. When married, an English woman lost her maiden name and personal identity, meaning she could not own property, file lawsuits, or participate in political life, even when widowed. The role of wives was to raise and nurture healthy children and support their husbands. Most women carried out these duties. In the mid-18th century, women usually married in their early 20s and had 6 to 8 children, most of whom survived to adulthood. Farm women provided most of the materials needed by the rest of the family by spinning yarn from wool and knitting sweaters and stockings, making candles and soap from ashes, and churning milk into butter.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Donahue, ''The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord'' (Yale Agrarian Studies Series) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|450px|long-term economic growth]]

Most New England parents tried to help their sons establish farms of their own. When sons married, fathers gave them gifts of land, livestock, or farming equipment; daughters received household goods, farm animals, and/or cash.  [[Arranged marriages]] were very unusual; normally, children chose their own spouses from within a circle of suitable acquaintances who shared their race, religion, and social standing. Parents retained veto power over their children's marriages.

New England farming families generally lived in wooden houses because of the abundance of trees. A typical New England farmhouse was one-and-a-half stories tall and had a strong frame (usually made of large square timbers) that was covered by wooden clapboard siding. A large chimney stood in the middle of the house that provided cooking facilities and warmth during the winter. One side of the ground floor contained a hall, a general-purpose room where the family worked and ate meals. Adjacent to the hall was the parlor, a room used to entertain guests that contained the family's best furnishings and the parent's bed. Children slept in a loft above, while the kitchen was either part of the hall or was located in a shed along the back of the house. Because colonial families were large, these small dwellings had much activity and there was little privacy.

By the middle of the 18th century, this way of life was facing a crisis as the region's population had nearly doubled each generation—from 100,000 in 1700 to 200,000 in 1725, to 350,000 by 1750—because farm households had many children, and most people lived until they were 60 years old. As colonists in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island continued to subdivide their land between farmers, the farms became too small to support single families. This overpopulation threatened the New England ideal of a society of independent yeoman farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Percy Wells Bidwell, ''Rural economy in New England at the beginning of the nineteenth century'' (1916) [http://books.google.com/books?id=6P8YAAAAYAAJ full text online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some farmers obtained land grants to create farms in undeveloped land in Massachusetts and Connecticut or bought plots of land from speculators in New Hampshire and what later became Vermont. Other farmers became agricultural innovators. They planted nutritious English grass such as [[red clover]] and [[timothy-grass]], which provided more feed for livestock, and potatoes, which provided a high production rate that was an advantage for small farms. Families increased their productivity by exchanging goods and labor with each other. They loaned livestock and grazing land to one another and worked together to spin yarn, sew quilts, and shuck corn. Migration, agricultural innovation, and economic cooperation were creative measures that preserved New England's yeoman society until the 19th century.

====Town life====
[[Image:Saltbox side elevation.png|thumb|[[Saltbox]]-style homes originated in [[New England]] after 1650]]

By the mid-18th century in New England, shipbuilding was a staple. The British crown often turned to the cheap, yet strongly built American ships. There was a shipyard at the mouth of almost every river in New England.

By 1750, a variety of artisans, shopkeepers, and merchants provided services to the growing farming population. [[Blacksmith]]s, [[wheelwright]]s, and furniture makers set up shops in [[rural]] villages. There they built and repaired goods needed by farm families. Stores selling English manufactures such as cloth, iron utensils, and window glass as well as [[West Indies|West Indian]] products like sugar and [[molasses]] were set up by traders. The storekeepers of these shops sold their imported goods in exchange for crops and other local products including [[roof shingle]]s, [[potash]], and [[barrel]] staves. These local goods were shipped to towns and cities all along the Atlantic Coast. Enterprising men set up [[stable]]s and [[tavern]]s along wagon roads to service this transportation system.

After these products had been delivered to port towns such as [[Boston]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in Massachusetts, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] in Connecticut, and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] in Rhode Island, merchants then exported them to the West Indies where they were traded for molasses, sugar, gold coins, and bills of exchange (credit slips). They carried the West Indian products to New England factories where the raw sugar was turned into granulated sugar and the molasses distilled into [[rum]]. The gold and credit slips were sent to England where they were exchanged for manufactures, which were shipped back to the colonies and sold along with the sugar and rum to farmers.

Other New England merchants took advantage of the rich fishing areas along the Atlantic Coast and financed a large fishing fleet, transporting its catch of [[mackerel]] and [[cod]] to the West Indies and Europe. Some merchants exploited the vast amounts of timber along the coasts and rivers of northern New England. They funded [[sawmill]]s that supplied cheap wood for houses and shipbuilding. Hundreds of New England shipwrights built oceangoing ships, which they sold to British and American merchants.

Many merchants became very wealthy by providing their goods to the agricultural population and ended up dominating the society of sea port cities. Unlike yeoman farmhouses, these merchants resembled the lifestyle of that of the upper class of England living in elegant {{frac|2|1|2}}-story houses designed the new Georgian style. These Georgian houses had a symmetrical [[façade]] with equal numbers of windows on both sides of the central door. The interior consisted of a passageway down the middle of the house with specialized rooms such as a library, dining room, formal parlor, and master bedroom off the sides. Unlike the multi-purpose space of the yeoman houses, each of these rooms served a separate purpose. In a Georgian house, men mainly used certain rooms, such as the library, while women mostly used the kitchen. These houses contained bedrooms on the second floor that provided privacy to parents and children.

====Culture and education====
{{main|History of education in the United States#Colonial Era}}{{Main|Education in Colonial America}}
Education was primarily the responsibility of families, but numerous religious groups, especially the Puritans in New England, established tax-supported elementary schools so their children could read the Bible.  Nearly all the religious denominations set up their own schools and colleges to train ministers.  Each city, and most towns, had private academies for the children of affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783'' (Harper, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|[[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]], oldest surviving building at [[Harvard University]], built 1718–1720 as a dormitory]]

Elementary education was widespread in New England. Early Puritan settlers believed it was necessary to study the Bible, so children were taught to read at an early age. It was also required that each town pay for a primary school. About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling and funded [[grammar school]]s in larger towns. Most boys learned skills from their fathers on the farm or as apprentices to artisans. Few girls attended formal schools, but most were able to get some education at home or at so-called &quot;Dame schools&quot; where women taught basic reading and writing skills in their own houses. By 1750, nearly 90% of New England's women and almost all of its men could read and write. Puritans founded [[Harvard College]] in 1636 and [[Yale College]] in 1701. Later, Baptists founded [[Rhode Island College]] (now [[Brown University]]) in 1764 and Congregationalists established [[Dartmouth College]] in 1769. Virginia founded schools the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1693; it was primarily Anglican. The colleges were designed for aspiring ministers, lawyers or doctors. There were no departments or majors, as every student shared the same curriculum, which focused on Latin and Greek, mathematics, and history, philosophy, logic, ethics, rhetoric, oratory, and a little basic science.    There were no sports or fraternities and few extracurricular activities apart from literary societies. There were no separate seminaries, law schools, or divinity schools. The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial era in Philadelphia and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

New Englanders wrote journals, pamphlets, books and especially sermons—more than all of the other colonies combined.  [[Cotton Mather]], a Boston minister published ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'' (The Great Works of Christ in America, 1702), while revivalist Jonathan Edwards wrote his philosophical work, ''A Careful and Strict Enquiry Into...Notions of...Freedom of Will...'' (1754). Most music had a religious theme as well and was mainly the singing of [[Psalm]]s. Because of New England's deep religious beliefs, artistic works that were insufficiently religious or too &quot;worldly&quot; were banned, especially the theater.  The leading theologian and philosopher of the colonial era was [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] of Massachusetts, an interpreter of Calvinism, and the leader of the [[First Great Awakening]].

====Religion====
Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of religious freedom. London did not make the Church of England official in the colonies—it never sent a bishop—so religious practice became diverse.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 2004) ch 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]'' was a major religious revival movement that took place in most colonies in the 1730s and 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 2004) ch 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began with [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]], a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims' strict [[Calvinist]] roots and to reawaken the &quot;Fear of God.&quot; English preacher [[George Whitefield]] and other itinerant preachers continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style. Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the &quot;New Lights&quot;, as contrasted with the &quot;Old Lights&quot;, who disapproved of their movement. To promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and colleges, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Williams College]]. The Great Awakening has been called the first truly American event.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Jon Butler]] has questioned the concept of a Great Awakening, but most historians use it. {{cite journal

A similar pietistic revival movement took place among some German and Dutch settlers, leading to more divisions. By the 1770s, the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded [[Brown University]]), and in the South (where they challenged the previously unquestioned [[moral authority]] of the Anglican establishment).

===Mid-Atlantic Region===
Unlike New England, the Mid-Atlantic Region gained much of its population from new immigration, and by 1750, the combined populations of [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] had reached nearly 300,000 people. By 1750, about 60,000 Irish and 50,000 [[German American|Germans]] came to live in British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic Region. [[William Penn]], the man who founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership. (&quot;Freehold&quot; meant owning land free and clear, with the right to resell it to anyone.) The first major influx of settlers were the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch Irish]], who headed to the frontier. Many Germans came to escape the religious conflicts and declining economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland.

====Ways of life====
Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity of its peoples. In [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and New York City, a majority of the buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each end while many Dutch churches were shaped liked an octagon. Using cut stone to build their houses, German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania followed the way of their homeland and completely ignored the plethora of timber in the area. An example of this would be [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], Pennsylvania where 80 percent of the buildings in the town were made entirely of stone. On the other hand, settlers from Ireland took advantage of America's ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy [[log cabin]]s.

Ethnic cultures also affected the styles of furniture. Rural Quakers preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables, chairs, chests and shunned elaborate decorations. However, some urban Quakers had much more elaborate furniture. The city of [[Philadelphia]] became a major center of furniture-making because of its massive wealth from Quaker and British merchants. Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks and [[highboy]]s. German artisans created intricate carved designs on their chests and other furniture with painted scenes of flowers and birds. German potters also crafted a large array of jugs, pots, and plates, of both elegant and traditional design.

There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.

By the time of the Revolutionary War, approximately 85 percent of white Americans were of English, Irish, Welsh, or Scottish descent. Approximately 8.8 percent of whites were of German ancestry, and 3.5 percent were of Dutch origin.

====Farming====
Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. As an example, German farmers generally preferred [[oxen]] rather than horses to pull their plows and Scots-Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and corn. In Ireland, people farmed intensively, working small pieces of land trying to get the largest possible production-rate from their crops. In the American colonies, settlers from northern Ireland focused on mixed-farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock. Many improvement-minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to raise their output. During the 1750s, these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and [[scythe]]s used to harvest [[hay]], [[wheat]], and [[barley]] with the cradle scythe, a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection. This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by farmers in one day. Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with [[Feces|dung]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[crop rotation|rotating their crops]] to keep the soil fertile.

Before 1720, most colonists in the mid-Atlantic region worked with small-scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the West Indies with corn and flour. In New York, a fur-pelt export trade to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region. After 1720, mid-Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for wheat. A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices up. By 1770, a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720. Farmers also expanded their production of [[flax seed]] and corn since flax was a high demand in the Irish [[linen]] industry and a demand for corn existed in the West Indies.

Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth, but many poor German and Irish immigrants were forced to work as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans also hired these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of [[cloth]] and other goods. Merchants often bought [[wool]] and flax from farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants, who had been [[textile]] workers in Ireland and Germany, to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence. The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both ethnic background and wealth.

====Seaports====
Seaports, which expanded from wheat trade, had more social classes than anywhere else in the Middle Colonies. By 1750, the population of Philadelphia had reached 25,000, New York 15,000, and the port of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] 7,000. Merchants dominated seaport society and about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia's trade. Wealthy merchants in Philadelphia and New York, like their counterparts in New England, built elegant Georgian-style mansions.

Shopkeepers, artisans, shipwrights, [[butcher]]s, [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]s, [[seamstress]]es, [[Shoemaking|cobbler]]s, [[baker]]s, [[carpenter]]s, [[masonry|masons]], and many other specialized professions, made up the middle class of seaport society. Wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts to pass it on through the family. Many of these artisans and traders made enough money to create a modest life.

Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society. These poor people worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound vessels with wheat, corn, and flaxseed. Many of these were [[African American]]; some were free while others were enslaved. In 1750, blacks made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and Philadelphia. Hundreds of seamen, some who were African American, worked as sailors on merchant ships.

===Southern Colonies===
The Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. They owned increasingly large plantations that were worked by African slaves. Of the 650,000 inhabitants of the South in 1750, about 250,000 or 40 percent, were slaves. The plantations grew tobacco, indigo and rice for export, and raised most of their own food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Twyman and David C. Roller, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Southern History'' (1979). ISBN 0-8071-0575-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, many small subsistence farms were family owned and operated by [[Plain Folk of the Old South|yeoman]]. Most white men owned some land, and therefore could vote.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Brown and B. Katherine Brown, ''Virginia, 1705–1786: Democracy or Aristocracy?'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women in the South====
Since the [[social history]] revolution in the 1970s historians have paid special attention to the role of women, family and gender in the colonial South.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Kierner, &quot;Gender, Families, and Households in the Southern Colonies,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'', Aug 2007, Vol. 73 Issue 3, pp 643–658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Virginia see Kathleen M. Brown, ''Good Wives, Nasty Wenches, and Anxious Patriarchs: Gender, Race, and Power in Colonial Virginia'' (1996) 512pp [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807846236/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Marsh, ''Georgia's Frontier Women: Female Fortunes in a Southern Colony'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] colonies, very few women were present. Much of the population consisted of young, single, white indentured servants, and as such the colonies, to a large degree, lacked any social cohesiveness. African women entered the colony as early as 1619, although their status: free, slave or indentured servant remains a historical debate. In the 17th century high mortality rates for newcomers and a very high ratio of men to women made family life either impossible or unstable for most colonists. These factors, along with dispersed settlements and a reluctance to live in villages, together with a growing immigration of white indentured servants and black slaves made families and communities in the Virginia-Maryland region before 1700 fundamentally different from their counterparts in Europe and New England. These extreme conditions both demeaned and empowered women. Lacking male protectors, women, especially teenage girls who were indentured servants, often were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. On the other hand, without parental oversight, young women had much more freedom in choosing spouses, and the shortage of eligible women enabled them to use marriage as an avenue to upward mobility. The high death rates meant that Chesapeake wives generally became widows who inherited property; many widows increased their property by remarrying as soon as possible. As the population began to stabilize around 1700, women married younger, remained wed longer, bore more children, and lost influence within the family polity.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Green Carr and Lorena S. Walsh, &quot;The Planter's Wife: The Experience of White Women in Seventeenth-Century Maryland,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' 34 (October 1977), 542–71 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2936182 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slaves====
{{Main|Slavery in Colonial America}}

Slaves imported to American colonies&lt;ref&gt;Source: Miller and Smith, eds. ''Dictionary of American Slavery'' (1988) p . 678&lt;/ref&gt;

About 600,000 slaves were imported into the U.S., or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought across from Africa. The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished.  Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S. (because of better food, less disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care) so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tadman, &quot;The Demographic Cost of Sugar: Debates on Slave Societies and Natural Increase in the Americas,&quot; ''The American Historical Review'' Dec. 2000 105:5 [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.5/ah001534.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The enslaved African (known as African [[slavery|slaves]], although they were not considered slaves until they were officially purchased by a planter or plantation owner) who worked on the [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]], [[tobacco]], and [[rice]] fields in the South came from mainly western and central Africa. Slavery in Colonial America was very oppressive as it passed on from generation to generation, and slaves had no legal rights. The colonies that had the most specialization in production of goods, such as sugar and coffee, relied most on slaves and consequentially, had the highest per capita (including slaves) income in the New World.  However, the slaves did not accrue wages or receive rights and provided free labor to those who purchased them and received just enough to live. They were considered in [[Chattel slavery]]. Between 1500 and 1700, over 60% of the 6 million people who were brought or traveled to the New World were involuntary slaves. In 1700, there were about 9,600 slaves in the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] region and a few hundred in the Carolinas. About 170,000 more Africans were forcibly brought over the next five decades. By 1750, there were more than 250,000 slaves in British America; and, in the Carolinas, they made up about 60 percent of the total population. The first post-colonial Census found 697,681 slaves and 59,527 free blacks, who together made up about 20% of the country's population. Most slaves in South Carolina were born in Africa, while half the slaves in Virginia and Maryland were born in the colonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
