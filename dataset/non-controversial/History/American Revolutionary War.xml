{{Campaignbox American Revolutionary War}}

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775–1783), the '''American War of Independence''',&lt;ref&gt;British writers generally favor &quot;American War of Independence&quot;, &quot;American Rebellion&quot;, or &quot;War of American Independence&quot;. See Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, ''Bibliography'' at the [http://revolution.h-net.msu.edu/bib.html Michigan State University] for usage in titles.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the '''Revolutionary War''' in the United States, began as a war between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the United States of America, but gradually grew into a [[world war]] between Britain on one side and the United States, France, Netherlands and Spain on the other. The main result was an American victory, with mixed results for the other powers.

The war was the result of the political [[American Revolution]]. Colonists galvanized around the position that the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposed by [[Parliament of Great Britain]], was unconstitutional. The British Parliament insisted it had the right to tax colonists. The colonists claimed that, as they were [[Rights of Englishmen|British subjects]], [[no taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] was illegal. The American colonists formed a unifying [[Continental Congress]] and a shadow government in each colony, though at first remaining loyal to the king. The American boycott of taxed British tea led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, when shiploads of tea were destroyed. London responded by ending self-government in [[Massachusetts]] and putting it under the control of the British army with General [[Thomas Gage]] as governor. In April 1775 Gage learned that weapons were being gathered in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], and he sent British troops to seize and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winthrop.dk/reports.html Orders from General Thomas Gage to Lieutenant Colonel Smith, 10th Regiment 'Foot Boston, April 18, 1775]&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[militia]] confronted the troops and exchanged fire (see [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]). After repeated pleas to the British monarchy for intervention with Parliament, any chance of a compromise ended when [[Proclamation of Rebellion|the Congress were declared traitors]] by royal decree, and they responded by [[Declaration of Independence|declaring the independence]] of a new [[sovereign nation]], the United States of America, on July 4, 1776. [[Loyalists (American Revolution)|American Loyalists]] rejected the Declaration, and sided with the king; they were excluded from power everywhere. American attempts to expand the rebellion into [[Province of Quebec|Quebec]] and the [[Floridas (disambiguation)|Floridas]] were unsuccessful.

[[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] all secretly provided [[Franco-American alliance#Background|supplies, ammunition and weapons]] to the revolutionaries starting early in 1776. By June 1776 the Americans were in full control of every state, but then the British Royal Navy captured New York City and made it their main base. The war became a standoff. The Royal Navy could occupy other coastal cities for brief periods, but the rebels controlled the countryside, where 90 percent of the population lived. British strategy relied on mobilizing [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist militia]], and was never fully realized. A British invasion from Canada in 1777 ended in the capture of the British army at the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. That American victory persuaded France [[France in the American Revolutionary War|to enter the war]] openly in early 1778, balancing the two sides' military strength. [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]—French allies—also went to war with Britain over the next four years, threatening an [[Armada of 1779|invasion of Great Britain]] and severely testing British military strength with campaigns in Europe. [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spain's involvement]] resulted in the [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|expulsion]] of British armies from [[West Florida]], securing the American southern flank. The decisive British naval victory at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] thwarted French and Spanish plans to drive Britain out of the Caribbean, and the joint Franco-Spanish attempt to capture the British stronghold of [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] also resulted in similar defeat.

French involvement proved decisive&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole, ''A companion to the American Revolution'' p 357&lt;/ref&gt; yet expensive, ruining France's economy and driving the country into massive debt.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1987) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; A French [[Battle of the Chesapeake|naval victory]] just outside [[Chesapeake Bay]] led to a siege by combined French and Continental armies that forced a second British army to surrender at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown, Virginia]] in 1781. Fighting continued throughout 1782, while peace negotiations began. 

In 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by what is now Canada to the north, [[Florida]] to the south, and the [[Mississippi River]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' ch 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historiographical431&quot;&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, &quot;The Treaty of Paris, 1783: A Historiographical Challenge,&quot; ''International History Review,'' Sept 1983, Vol. 5 Issue 3, pp 431–442&lt;/ref&gt; A wider international peace was agreed, in which several territories were exchanged.

===American armies and militias===
{{Main|Continental Army|Minutemen}}

[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|right|300px|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]
When the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used [[Partisan (military)|partisan warfare]] but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;59. On militia see Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;707, and Weigley (1973), ch.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established (on paper) a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as [[commander-in-chief]]. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

The [[United States Marine Corps]] traces its institutional roots to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed at [[Tun Tavern]] in [[Philadelphia]], by a resolution of the [[Continental Congress]] on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;&gt;Crocker (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the [[Continental Navy]] and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time.

Armies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities on the American side.&lt;ref&gt;Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;264 says the largest force Washington commanded was &quot;under 17,000&quot;; Duffy (1987), p.&amp;nbsp;17, estimates Washington's maximum was &quot;only 13,000 troops&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also difficult for Great Britain to transport troops across the Atlantic and they depended on local supplies that the Patriots tried to cut off. By comparison, Duffy notes that [[Frederick the Great]] usually commanded from 23,000 to 50,000 in battle. Both figures pale in comparison to the armies that would be fielded in the early 19th century, where troop formations approached or exceeded 100,000 men.

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}

Historians&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;235&lt;/ref&gt; have estimated that approximately 40 to 45 percent of the colonists supported the rebellion, while 15 to 20 percent remained loyal to the Crown. The rest attempted to remain neutral and kept a low profile.

At least 25,000 Loyalists fought on the side of the British. Thousands served in the Royal Navy. On land, Loyalist forces fought alongside the British in most battles in North America. Many Loyalists fought in partisan units, especially in the Southern theater.&lt;ref&gt;Savas and Dameron (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;xli&lt;/ref&gt;

The British military met with many difficulties in maximizing the use of Loyalist factions. British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] wrote, &quot;In the American war it was clear to both royal generals and revolutionaries that organized and significant Loyalist activity would require the presence of British forces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, the use of Loyalists presented the British with &quot;major problems of strategic choice&quot; since while it was necessary to widely disperse troops in order to defend Loyalist areas, it was also recognized that there was a need for &quot;the maintenance of large concentrated forces able&quot; to counter major attacks from the American forces.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the British were forced to ensure that their military actions would not &quot;offend Loyalist opinion&quot;, eliminating such options as attempting to &quot;live off the country&quot;, destroying property for intimidation purposes, or coercing payments from colonists (&quot;laying them under contribution&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;

===British armies and auxiliaries===
{{Further2|[[History of the British Army#American War of Independence|History of the British Army: American War of Independence]]}}

Early in 1775, the [[British Army]] consisted of about 36,000 men worldwide, but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number. Great Britain had a difficult time appointing general officers, however. General [[Thomas Gage]], in command of British forces in North America when the rebellion started, was criticized for being too lenient (perhaps influenced by his [[Margaret Kemble Gage|American wife]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]] turned down an appointment as commander in chief due to an unwillingness to take sides in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] turned down a command, saying &quot;I cannot draw the sword in such a cause.&quot; The [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham|Earl of Effingham]] publicly resigned his commission when his [[Cheshire Regiment|22nd Regiment of foot]] was posted to America, and [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] and [[John Burgoyne]] were [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] who opposed military solutions to the American rebellion. Howe and [[Henry Clinton (1730–1795)|Henry Clinton]] stated that they were unwilling participants in the war and were only following orders.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;77&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the war, Great Britain signed treaties with various [[Germans in the American Revolution|German]] states, which supplied about 30,000 soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Germans made up about one-third of the British troop strength in North America. The [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] contributed more soldiers than any other state, and German soldiers became known as &quot;[[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]]&quot; to the Americans. Revolutionary speakers called German soldiers &quot;foreign mercenaries,&quot; and they are scorned as such in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. By 1779, the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60,000, although these were spread from Canada to Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–29; Boatner (1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–26&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, several German principalities offered military support to Great Britain but these offers were rejected. However, as the war dragged on it became clear that Great Britain would need the extra manpower of the German states and led to Great Britain seeking support from German principalities such as Hesse-Kassel and Ansbach-Bayreuth.&lt;ref&gt;Morrissey (2004) pp. 20, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of State at War [[Lord Barrington]] and the Adjutant-General [[Edward Harvey]] were both strongly opposed to outright war on land. In 1766 Barrington had recommended withdrawing the army from the 13 Colonies to Canada, Nova Scotia and Florida. At the beginning of the war he urged a naval blockade, which would quickly damage the colonists' trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Americans===
[[File:American Foot Soldiers.jpg|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]
[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] masters and promised freedom to those who served. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Another all-black unit came from [[Haiti]] with French forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–69 (Revolutionary all-black units)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off into the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves, now freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the British were estimated to evacuate nearly 20,000 freedmen (including families) with other Loyalists and their troops at the end of the war. More than 3,000 freedmen were resettled in Nova Scotia; others were transported to the West Indies of the Caribbean islands, and some to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071012032555/http://americanrevolution.com/AfricanAmericansInTheRevolution.htm &quot;&quot;African Americans In The Revolutionary Period], American Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further|Book of Negroes}}

===Native Americans===
Most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many communities were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. Though a few tribes were on friendly terms with the Americans, most Native Americans opposed the United States as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Native Americans fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;545&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict; although the Confederacy did not take sides, the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] fought on both sides. Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes which had sided with the British. Both during and after the war friction between the Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]], who had sided with the Americans and the British respectively, further exacerbated the split.

Pybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots, and 12,000 left the country at the end of the war, for freedom in Canada or slavery in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Cassadra Pybus, &quot;Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution.&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 2005 62(2): 243–264.

Baller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;William Baller, &quot;Farm Families and the American Revolution.&quot; ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28–44.

McDonnell, (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A.

&lt;!-- and this section is a brief summary of the &quot;Boston campaign&quot; article, so add additional details there rather than here.--&gt;
{{Main|Boston campaign}}

Before the war, [[Boston]] had been the center of much revolutionary activity, leading to the punitive [[Massachusetts Government Act]] in 1774 that ended local government. Popular resistance to these measures, however, compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston. Lieutenant General [[Thomas Gage]], the British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|North American commander-in chief]], commanded four regiments of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston, but the countryside was in the hands of the Revolutionaries.

[[File:British Army in Concord Detail.jpg|thumb|left|The British marching to [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in April 1775]]

On the night of April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. Riders including [[Paul Revere]] alerted the countryside, and when British troops entered [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the morning of April 19, they found 77 [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] formed up on the village green. Shots were exchanged, killing several minutemen. The British moved on to Concord, where a detachment of three companies was engaged and routed at the North Bridge by a force of 500 minutemen. As the British retreated back to Boston, thousands of militiamen attacked them along the roads, inflicting great damage before timely British reinforcements prevented a total disaster. With the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], the war had begun.

The militia converged on Boston, [[siege of Boston|bottling up the British]] in the city. About 4,500 more British soldiers arrived by sea, and on June 17, 1775, British forces under General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] seized the Charlestown peninsula at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The Americans fell back, but British losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up. The siege was not broken, and Gage was soon replaced by Howe as the British commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1775, newly appointed General Washington arrived outside Boston to take charge of the colonial forces and to organize the Continental Army. Realizing his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. Arsenals were raided and some manufacturing was attempted; 90% of the supply (2 million pounds) was imported by the end of 1776, mostly from France.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson (1925), pp.&amp;nbsp;271–281&lt;/ref&gt; Patriots in New Hampshire had seized powder, muskets and cannons from [[Fort William and Mary]] in Portsmouth Harbor in late 1774.&lt;ref&gt;* Elwin L.

The standoff continued throughout the fall and winter. In early March 1776, heavy cannons that the patriots had [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured at Fort Ticonderoga]] were brought to Boston by Colonel [[Henry Knox]], and [[fortification of Dorchester Heights|placed on Dorchester Heights]]. Since the artillery now overlooked the British positions, Howe's situation was untenable, and the British [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|fled]] on March 17, 1776, sailing to their naval base at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S.

[[File:Canadian militiamen and British soldiers repulse the American assault at Sault-au-Matelot.jpg|thumb|210px|Canadian militiamen and British soldiers repulse the American assault at [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Sault-au-Matelot]], December 1775]]
Three weeks after the siege of Boston began, a troop of militia volunteers led by [[Ethan Allen]] and [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]], a strategically important point on [[Lake Champlain]] between New York and the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]]. After that action they also raided [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort St. John's]], not far from Montreal, which alarmed the population and the authorities there. In response, Quebec's governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] began fortifying St. John's, and opened negotiations with the [[Iroquois]] and other Native American tribes for their support. These actions, combined with lobbying by both Allen and Arnold and the fear of a British attack from the north, eventually persuaded the Congress to authorize an invasion of Quebec, with the goal of driving the British military from that province. (Quebec was then frequently referred to as ''Canada'', as most of its territory included the former French Province of [[Canada, New France|Canada]].)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Desjardin, ''Through a Howling Wilderness: Benedict Arnold's March to Quebec, 1775'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Quebec-bound expeditions were undertaken. On September 28, 1775, Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] marched north from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] with about 1,700 militiamen, [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|besieging and capturing Fort St. Jean]] on November 2 and then Montreal on November 13. General Carleton escaped to [[Quebec City]] and began preparing that city for an attack. The [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|second expedition]], led by Colonel Arnold, went through the wilderness of what is now northern Maine. Logistics were difficult, with 300 men turning back, and another 200 perishing due to the harsh conditions. By the time Arnold reached Quebec City in early November, he had but 600 of his original 1,100 men. Montgomery's force joined Arnold's, and they [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attacked Quebec City]] on December 31, but were defeated by Carleton in a battle that ended with Montgomery dead, Arnold wounded, and over 400 Americans taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Sterne Randall]], &quot;Benedict Arnold at Quebec,&quot; ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' Summer 1990, Vol. 2 Issue 4, pp 38–49&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining Americans held on outside Quebec City until the spring of 1776, suffering from poor camp conditions and smallpox, and then withdrew when a squadron of British ships under [[Sir Charles Douglas, 1st Baronet|Captain Charles Douglas]] arrived to relieve the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Desjardin, ''Through a Howling Wilderness: Benedict Arnold's March to Quebec, 1775'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt was made by the Americans to push back towards Quebec, but they failed at [[Battle of Trois-Rivières|Trois-Rivières]] on June 8, 1776. Carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated Arnold at the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] in October. Arnold fell back to Fort Ticonderoga, where the invasion had begun. While the invasion ended as a disaster for the Americans, Arnold's efforts in 1776 delayed a full-scale British counteroffensive until the [[Saratoga campaign]] of 1777.

The invasion cost the Americans their base of support in British public opinion, &quot;So that the violent measures towards America are freely adopted and countenanced by a majority of individuals of all ranks, professions, or occupations, in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1960), p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt; It gained them at best limited support in the population of Quebec, which, while somewhat supportive early in the invasion, became less so later during the occupation, when American policies against suspected Loyalists became harsher, and the army's hard currency ran out. Two small regiments of [[Canadien]]s were recruited during the operation, and they were with the army on its retreat back to Ticonderoga.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Lefkowitz, ''Benedict Arnold's Army: The 1775 American Invasion of Canada during the Revolutionary War'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BattleofLongisland.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers in the [[Battle of Long Island]], 1776]]

Having withdrawn his army from Boston, General Howe now focused on capturing New York City, which then was limited to the southern tip of Manhattan Island. To defend the city, General Washington spread about 20,000 soldiers along the shores of New York's harbor, concentrated on [[Long Island]] and [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52,83&lt;/ref&gt; While British and recently hired [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] troops were assembling across the upper harbor on [[Staten Island]] for the campaign, Washington had the newly issued [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of American Independence]] read to his men and the citizens of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; No longer was there any possibility of compromise.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- The next paragraph notes a peace conference&amp;nbsp;— that seems contradictory, and if it isn't it needs to be explained --&gt; On August 27, 1776, after landing about 22,000 men on Long Island, the British drove the Americans back to [[Brooklyn Heights]], securing a decisive British victory in the [[Battle of Long Island|largest battle of the entire Revolution]]. Howe then laid [[siege]] to fortifications there. In a feat considered by many military historians to be one of his most impressive actions as Commander in Chief, Washington personally directed the [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of his entire remaining army and all their supplies across the [[East River]] in one night without discovery by the British or significant loss of men and [[materiel]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;91–101&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[Staten Island Peace Conference|failed peace conference]] on September 11, Howe resumed the attack. On September 15, Howe [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed about 12,000 men]] on lower Manhattan, quickly taking control of New York City. The Americans withdrew north up the island to Harlem Heights, where they [[Battle of Harlem Heights|skirmished the next day]] but held their ground. When Howe moved to encircle Washington's army in October, the Americans again fell back, and a [[Battle of White Plains|battle at White Plains]] was fought on October 28.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;102–111&lt;/ref&gt; Again Washington retreated, and Howe returned to Manhattan and captured [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking about 2,000 prisoners (with an additional 1,000 having been captured during the battle for Long Island). Thus began [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|the infamous &quot;prison ships&quot; system]] the British maintained in New York for the rest of the war, in which more American soldiers and sailors [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|died of neglect]] than died in every battle of the entire war, combined.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles, Henry Reed. &quot;Letters from the prisons and prison-ships of the revolution&quot;.

Howe then detached General Clinton to seize [[Newport, Rhode Island]], while [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Lord Cornwallis]] continued to chase Washington's army through [[New Jersey]], until the Americans withdrew across the [[Delaware River]] into Pennsylvania in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–137&lt;/ref&gt; With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season, the British entered winter quarters. Although Howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing American army, he had killed or captured over 5,000 Americans.

The outlook of the Continental Army was bleak. &quot;These are the times that try men's souls,&quot; wrote [[Thomas Paine]], who was with the army on the retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140&lt;/ref&gt; The army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men fit for duty, and would be reduced to 1,400 after enlistments expired at the end of the year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Congress had abandoned Philadelphia in despair, although popular resistance to British occupation was growing in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;143–205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Emanuel Leutze]]'s stylized depiction of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (1851)]]
Washington decided to take the offensive, [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|stealthily crossing the Delaware]] on Christmas night and capturing nearly 1,000 Hessians at the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;206–259&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton but was first [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|repulsed]] and then outmaneuvered by Washington, who successfully attacked the British rearguard at [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] on January 3, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;277–343&lt;/ref&gt; Washington then entered winter quarters at [[Morristown, New Jersey]], having given a morale boost to the American cause. New Jersey militia continued to harass British and Hessian forces [[Forage War|throughout the winter]], forcing the British to retreat to their base in and around New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;345–358&lt;/ref&gt;

At every stage the British strategy assumed a large base of Loyalist supporters would rally to the King given some military support. In February 1776 Clinton took 2,000 men and a naval squadron to invade North Carolina, which he called off when he learned the Loyalists had been crushed at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]]. In June he tried to seize [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the leading port in the South, hoping for a simultaneous rising in South Carolina. It seemed a cheap way of waging the war but [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|it failed]] as the naval force was defeated by the forts and because no local Loyalists attacked the town from behind. The Loyalists were too poorly organized to be effective, but as late as 1781 senior officials in London, misled by Loyalist exiles, placed their confidence in their rising. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

When the British began to plan operations for 1777, they had two main armies in North America: Carleton's army in Quebec, and Howe's army in New York. In London, [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Germain]] approved campaigns for these armies which, because of miscommunication, poor planning, and rivalries between commanders, did not work in conjunction. Although Howe successfully captured Philadelphia, the northern army was lost in a disastrous surrender at Saratoga. Both Carleton and Howe resigned after the 1777 campaign.

====Saratoga campaign====
{{Main|Saratoga campaign}}

&lt;!-- This is a brief summary of the &quot;Saratoga campaign&quot; article. Add details there rather than here. --&gt;
The first of the 1777 campaigns was an expedition from Quebec led by General [[John Burgoyne]]. The goal was to seize the [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Hudson River]] corridor, effectively isolating [[New England]] from the rest of the American colonies. Burgoyne's invasion had two components: he would lead about 8,000 men along Lake Champlain towards [[Albany, New York]], while a second column of about 2,000 men, led by [[Barry St. Leger]], would move down the [[Mohawk River]] Valley and link up with Burgoyne in Albany.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;84&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne set off in June, and [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|recaptured Fort Ticonderoga]] in early July. Thereafter, his march was slowed by the Americans who literally knocked down trees in his path, and by his army's extensive baggage train. A detachment sent out to seize supplies was decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Bennington]] by American militia in August, depriving Burgoyne of nearly 1,000 men.

Meanwhile, St. Leger—more than half of his force Native Americans led by [[Sayenqueraghta]]—had [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|laid siege to Fort Stanwix]]. American militiamen and their Native American allies marched to relieve the siege but were ambushed and scattered at the [[Battle of Oriskany]]. When a second relief expedition approached, this time led by Benedict Arnold, St. Leger's Indian support abandoned him, forcing him to break off the siege and return to Quebec.

Burgoyne's army had been reduced to about 6,000 men by the loss at Bennington and the need to garrison Ticonderoga, and he was running short on supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;285–323&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these setbacks, he determined to push on towards Albany. An American army of 8,000 men, commanded by General [[Horatio Gates]], had entrenched about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Saratoga, New York]]. Burgoyne tried to outflank the Americans but was checked at the [[Battle of Freeman's Farm|first battle of Saratoga]] in September. Burgoyne's situation was desperate, but he now hoped that help from Howe's army in New York City might be on the way. It was not: Howe had instead sailed away on his expedition to capture Philadelphia. American militiamen flocked to Gates' army, swelling his force to 11,000 by the beginning of October. After being badly beaten at the [[Battle of Bemis Heights|second battle of Saratoga]], Burgoyne surrendered on October 17.

Saratoga was the turning point of the war. Revolutionary confidence and determination, suffering from Howe's successful occupation of Philadelphia, was renewed. What is more important, the victory encouraged [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]] to make an open alliance with the Americans, after two years of semi-secret support. For the British, the war had now become much more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;188–98&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philadelphia campaign====
{{Main|Philadelphia campaign}}

&lt;!-- This is a brief summary of the &quot;Philadelphia campaign&quot; article. Add details there rather than here. --&gt;
Having secured New York City in 1776, General Howe concentrated on capturing Philadelphia, the seat of the Revolutionary government, in 1777. He moved slowly, landing 15,000 troops in late August at the northern end of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Washington positioned his 11,000 men between Howe and Philadelphia but was driven back at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777. The Continental Congress again abandoned Philadelphia, and on September 26, Howe finally outmaneuvered Washington and marched into the city unopposed. Washington unsuccessfully [[Battle of Germantown|attacked the British encampment in nearby Germantown]] in early October and then retreated to watch and wait.

After repelling a British attack at [[Battle of White Marsh|White Marsh]], Washington and his army encamped at [[Valley Forge]] in December 1777, about 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) from Philadelphia, where they stayed for the next six months. Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure. The next spring, however, the army emerged from Valley Forge in good order, thanks in part to a training program supervised by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], who introduced the most modern [[Prussia]]n methods of organization and tactics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

General Clinton replaced Howe as British commander-in-chief. French entry into the war had changed British strategy, and Clinton abandoned Philadelphia to reinforce New York City, now vulnerable to French naval power. Washington shadowed Clinton on his withdrawal and forced a strategic victory at the [[Battle of Monmouth|battle at Monmouth]] on June 28, 1778, the last major battle in the north. Clinton's army went to New York City in July, arriving just before a French fleet under [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]] arrived off the American coast. Washington's army returned to [[White Plains, New York]], north of the city. Although both armies were back where they had been two years earlier, the nature of the war had now changed.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;175–188&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1776 France had informally been involved in the American Revolutionary War, with [[French people|French]] admiral [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|Latouche Tréville]] having provided [[France in the American Revolutionary War#French involvement|supplies, ammunition and guns]] from France to the United States after [[Thomas Jefferson]] had encouraged a French alliance, and guns such as [[Florent-Jean de Vallière|de Valliere]] type were used, playing an important role in such battles as the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/spar/historyculture/french-field_4pdr.htm Springfield Armory]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] wrote about the French supplies and guns in a letter to General [[William Heath|Heath]] on May 2, 1777. After learning of the American victory at Saratoga, France signed the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with the United States on February 6, 1778, formalizing the [[Franco-American alliance]] negotiated by [[Benjamin Franklin]].

Dept. of Defense | author=E. Chavez, Thomas | year=1997 | pages=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental Congress had charged the commissioners to travel to Europe and forge alliances with other European powers that could help break the British naval blockade along the North American coast. Aranda invited the commission to his house in Paris, where he was acting as Spanish ambassador and he became an active supporter of the struggle of the fledgling Colonies, recommending an early and open Spanish commitment to the Colonies. However he was overruled by [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca]] who opted by a more discreet approach. The Spanish position was later summarized by the Spanish Ambassador to the French Court, [[Jerónimo Grimaldi, 1st Duke of Grimaldi|Jerónimo Grimaldi]], in a letter to Arthur Lee who was in Madrid trying to persuade the Spanish government to declare an open alliance. Grimaldi told Lee that &quot;You have considered your own situation, and not ours. The moment is not yet come for us. The war with Portugal&amp;nbsp;— France being unprepared, and our treasure ships from South America not being arrived&amp;nbsp;— makes it improper for us to declare immediately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, 1:408&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Grimaldi reassured Lee, stores of clothing and powder were deposited at New Orleans and Havana for the Americans, and further shipments of blankets were being collected at Bilbao.

Spain finally entered officially the war in June 1779, thus implementing the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]], although the Spanish government had been providing assistance to the revolutionaries since the very beginning of the war. So too had the [[Dutch Republic]], which was formally brought into the war at the end of 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1987) ch 7–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punish the Americans==
[[File:ChappelWyomingMassacre.jpg|thumb|210px|Oil on canvas painting depicting the [[Wyoming Massacre]], July 3, 1778]]
In London [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] gave up all hope of subduing America by more armies, while Britain had a European war to fight. &quot;It was a joke,&quot; he said, &quot;to think of keeping Pennsylvania.&quot; There was no hope of recovering New England. But the King was still determined &quot;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan (1912), vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was to keep the 30,000 men garrisoned in New York, Rhode Island, Quebec, and Florida; other forces would attack the French and Spanish in the West Indies. To punish the Americans the King planned to destroy their coasting-trade, bombard their ports; sack and burn towns along the coast (as [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Battle of Groton Heights|did to New London, Connecticut]] in 1781), and turn loose the Native Americans to attack civilians in frontier settlements. These operations, the King felt, would inspire the Loyalists; would splinter the Congress; and &quot;would keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse&quot; and they would beg to return to his authority.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan (1912), vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; The plan meant destruction for the Loyalists and loyal Native Americans, an indefinite prolongation of a costly war, and the risk of disaster as the French and Spanish assembled an armada to invade the British Isles. The British planned to re-subjugate the rebellious colonies after dealing with the Americans' European allies.

When the war began, the British had overwhelming naval superiority over the American colonists. The [[Royal Navy]] had over 100 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and many frigates and smaller craft, although this fleet was old and in poor condition, a situation which would be blamed on [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. During the first three years of the war, the Royal Navy was primarily used to transport troops for land operations and to protect commercial shipping. The American colonists had no [[ships of the line]], and relied extensively on [[privateer]]ing to harass British shipping. The privateers caused worry disproportionate to their material success, although those operating out of French [[English Channel|channel]] ports before and after France joined the war caused significant embarrassment to the Royal Navy and inflamed Anglo-French relations. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard the privateers during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html Privateers or Merchant Mariners help win the Revolutionary War]&lt;/ref&gt; The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/privateer.htm Privateers]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continental Congress]] authorized the creation of a small [[Continental Navy]] in October 1775, which was primarily used for [[commerce raiding]]. [[John Paul Jones]] became the first great American naval hero, capturing [[HMS Drake (1777)|HMS ''Drake'']] on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;331–46&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Siege and Relief of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782|The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar]]'', September 13, 1782, by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]

France's formal entry into the war meant that British naval superiority was now contested. The Franco-American alliance began poorly, however, with failed operations at [[Battle of Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] in 1778 and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]], in 1779. Part of the problem was that France and the United States had different military priorities: France hoped to capture British possessions in the [[West Indies]] before helping to secure American independence. While French financial assistance to the American war effort was already of critical importance, French military aid to the Americans would not show positive results until the arrival in July 1780 of a large force of soldiers led by the [[Comte de Rochambeau]].

Spain entered the war as a French ally with the goal of recapturing [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]], which it had lost to the British in 1704. [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Gibraltar was besieged]] for more than three years, but the British garrison stubbornly resisted and was resupplied twice: once after Admiral [[George Rodney|Rodney]]'s victory over [[Juan de Lángara]] in the 1780 [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|&quot;Moonlight Battle&quot;]], and again after Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] fought [[Luis de Córdova y Córdova]] to a draw in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]]. Further Franco-Spanish efforts to capture Gibraltar were unsuccessful. One notable success took place on February 5, 1782, when Spanish and French forces [[Invasion of Minorca, 1781|captured Minorca]], which Spain retained after the war. Ambitious plans for an invasion of Great Britain in 1779 [[Armada of 1779|had to be abandoned]].

===West Indies and Gulf Coast===
[[File:Bernardo de Galvez.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bernardo de Gálvez]]]]
{{Main|Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War}}
There was much action in the West Indies, especially in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Although France lost [[Battle of St. Lucia|St. Lucia]] early in the war, its navy dominated the West Indies, capturing [[Invasion of Dominica|Dominica]], [[Capture of Grenada (1779)|Grenada]], [[Capture of Saint Vincent|Saint Vincent]], [[Capture of Montserrat|Montserrat]], [[Invasion of Tobago|Tobago]], [[Battle of St. Kitts|St. Kitts]] and the [[Battle of Grand Turk|Turks and Caicos]] between 1778 and 1782. [[Dutch Antilles|Dutch possessions]] in the West Indies and South America [[Dutch West Indies campaign|were captured]] by Britain [[Recapture of Demerara and Essequibo|but later recaptured]] by France and restored to the [[Dutch Republic]]. At the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in April 1782, a victory by Rodney's fleet over the French [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] frustrated the hopes of France and Spain to take [[Jamaica]] and other colonies from the British.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez|Count Bernardo de Gálvez]], the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana|governor]] of [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]], quickly removed the British from their outposts on the lower [[Mississippi River]] in 1779 in actions at [[Battle of Fort Bute|Manchac]] and [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Baton Rouge]] in British [[West Florida]]. Gálvez then captured [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]] in 1780 and [[Siege of Pensacola|stormed and captured]] the British citadel and capital of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] in 1781. On May 8, 1782, Gálvez [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|captured]] the British naval base at [[New Providence]] in [[the Bahamas]]; it was ceded by Spain after the Treaty of Paris and simultaneously [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recovered]] by British Loyalists in 1783. Gálvez' actions led to the Spanish acquisition of [[East Florida|East]] and West Florida in the peace settlement, denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south, and kept open a vital conduit for supplies to the American frontier. The Continental Congress cited Gálvez in 1785 for his aid during the revolution and George Washington took him to his right during the first [[Independence Day (United States)|parade of July 4]].&lt;ref&gt;Heintze, &quot;A Chronology of Notable Fourth of July Celebration Occurrences&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jaillot-Elwe, Norteamerica, 1792.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Norteamerica, 1792, Jaillot-Elwe, Florida's borders after Bernardo Gálvez's military actions.]]
Central America was also subject to conflict between Britain and Spain, as Britain sought to expand its influence beyond coastal logging and fishing communities in present-day [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]]. Expeditions against [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|San Fernando de Omoa]] in 1779 and [[San Juan Expedition (1780)|San Juan]] in 1780 (the latter famously led by a young [[Horatio Nelson]]) met with only temporary success before being abandoned due to disease. The Spanish colonial leaders, in turn, could not completely eliminate British influences along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. Except for the French acquisition of [[Tobago]], sovereignty in the West Indies was returned to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' in the peace of 1783.

===India and the Netherlands===
{{Campaignbox American War of Independence: East Indies}}

When word reached India in 1778 that France had entered the war, the [[British East India Company]] moved quickly to capture French colonial outposts there, [[Siege of Pondicherry (1778)|capturing Pondicherry]] after two months of siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riddick23_5&quot;&gt;Riddick (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the French-controlled port of [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] on India's west coast motivated [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'s ruler, [[Hyder Ali]] (who was already upset at other British actions, and benefited from trade through the port), to open the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in 1780. Ali, and later his son [[Tipu Sultan]], almost drove the British from southern India but was frustrated by weak French support, and the war ended ''status quo ante bellum'' with the 1784 [[Treaty of Mangalore]]. French opposition was led in 1782 and 1783 by Admiral the [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Baillie de Suffren]], who [[Capture of Trincomalee|recaptured Trincomalee]] from the British and fought five celebrated, but largely inconclusive, naval engagements against British Admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher155_8&quot;&gt;Fletcher (1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt; France's Indian colonies were returned after the war.

[[File:Suffren meeting with Haider Ali J B Morret engraving 1789.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]] meeting with ally [[Hyder Ali]] in 1783. J.B. Morret engraving, 1789]]
The Dutch Republic, nominally neutral, had been trading with the Americans, exchanging Dutch arms and munitions for American colonial wares (in contravention of the British ''[[Navigation Acts]]''), primarily through activity based in [[St. Eustatius]], before the French formally entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–38, 42–62; The American trade via St. Eustatius was very substantial. In 1779 more than 12,000 [[hogshead]]s of tobacco and 1.5 million ounces of indigo were shipped from the Colonies to the island in exchange for naval supplies and other goods; Edler, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The British considered this trade to include contraband military supplies and had attempted to stop it, at first diplomatically by appealing to previous treaty obligations, interpretation of whose terms the two nations disagreed on, and then by searching and seizing Dutch merchant ships. The situation escalated when the British [[Affair of Fielding and Bylandt|seized a Dutch merchant convoy sailing under Dutch naval escort]] in December 1779, prompting the Dutch to join the [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]]. Britain responded to this decision by declaring war on the Dutch in December 1780, sparking the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;95–173&lt;/ref&gt; The war was a military and economic disaster for the Dutch Republic. Paralyzed by internal political divisions, it could not respond effectively to British blockades of its coast and the capture of many of its colonies. In the 1784 peace treaty between the two nations, the Dutch lost the Indian port of [[Negapatam]] and were forced to make trade concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;233–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Republic signed a friendship and trade agreement with the United States in 1782, becoming the second country (after France) to formally recognize the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;205–232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern theater==
{{Main|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}

During the first three years of the American Revolutionary War, the primary military encounters were in the north, although some attempts to organize Loyalists were defeated, a British [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|attempt at Charleston, South Carolina]] failed, and a variety of efforts to attack British forces in [[East Florida]] failed. After French entry into the war, the British turned their attention to the southern colonies, where they hoped to regain control by recruiting large numbers of Loyalists. This southern strategy also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where the British needed to defend economically important possessions against the French and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banastre-Tarleton-by-Joshua-Reynolds.jpg|thumb|upright|The British Lt. Col. [[Banastre Tarleton]]. Painting by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1782.]]

On December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from Clinton's army in New York captured [[Savannah, Georgia]]. An attempt by French and American forces to [[Siege of Savannah|retake Savannah]] failed on October 9, 1779. Clinton then [[siege of Charleston|besieged Charleston]], capturing it and most of the southern Continental Army on May 12, 1780. With relatively few casualties, Clinton had seized the South's biggest city and seaport, providing a base for further conquest.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Gordon and John Keegan, ''South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of the southern Continental Army began to withdraw to [[North Carolina]] but were pursued by Lt. Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]], who defeated them at the [[Waxhaw Massacre|Waxhaws]] on May 29, 1780. With these events, organized American military activity in the region collapsed, though the war was carried on by partisans such as [[Francis Marion]]. Cornwallis took over British operations, while [[Horatio Gates]] arrived to command the American effort. On August 16, 1780, Gates was defeated at the [[Battle of Camden]], setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh F. Rankin, ''North Carolina in the American Revolution'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwallis' victories quickly turned, however. One wing of his army was utterly defeated at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] on October 7, 1780, and Tarleton was decisively defeated by [[Daniel Morgan]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781. General [[Nathanael Greene]], who replaced General Gates, proceeded to wear down the British in a series of battles, each of them tactically a victory for the British but giving no strategic advantage to the victors. Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous: &quot;We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.&quot; By March, Greene's army had grown to the point where he felt that he could face Cornwallis directly. In the key [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], Cornwallis defeated Greene, but at tremendous cost, and without breaking Greene's army. He retreated to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] for resupply and reinforcement, after which he moved north into [[Virginia]], leaving the Carolinas and Georgia open to Greene. The British strategy that assumed thousands of Loyalists would flock to the Crown was a failure—far fewer joined up than expected because the Patriots put heavy pressure on Loyalists and their families would become hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1781, a British force under [[Benedict Arnold]] landed in Virginia, and began moving through the Virginia countryside, destroying supply depots, mills, and other economic targets. In February, General Washington dispatched [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]] to counter Arnold, later also sending General [[Anthony Wayne]]. Arnold was reinforced with additional troops from New York in March, and his army was joined with that of Cornwallis in May. Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis, avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements. Cornwallis could not trap Lafayette, and upon his arrival at [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in June, received orders from General Clinton to establish a fortified naval base in Virginia. Following these orders, he fortified [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], and, shadowed by Lafayette, awaited the arrival of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cecere, ''Great Things are Expected from the Virginians: Virginia in the American Revolution'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern and Western frontier==
{{Further2|[[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War]]}}
[[File:Ftsackville.gif|thumb|left|[[George Rogers Clark]]'s 180 mile (290 km) winter march led to the capture of General [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec]]

West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and along the border with [[Quebec]], the American Revolutionary War was an &quot;[[American Indian Wars|Indian War]]&quot;. Most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] supported the British. Like the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, tribes such as the [[Shawnee]] split into factions, and the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga]] split off from the rest of the [[Cherokee]] over differences regarding peace with the [[Americans]]. The British supplied their [[nativ]]e allies with [[muskets]], [[gunpowder]] and advice, while Loyalists led raids against [[civilian]] settlements, especially in New York, [[Kentucky]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. Joint Iroquois-Loyalist attacks in the [[Wyoming Valley massacre|Wyoming Valley]] and at [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] in 1778 provoked [[George Washington|Washington]] to send the [[Sullivan Expedition]] into western New York during the summer of 1779. There was little fighting as [[John Sullivan|Sullivan]] systematically destroyed the Indians' winter food supplies, forcing them to flee permanently to British bases in [[Quebec]] and the [[Niagara Falls]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ohio Country]] and the [[Illinois Country]], the Virginia frontiersman [[George Rogers Clark]] attempted to neutralize British influence among the Ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] and Cahokia and [[Battle of Vincennes|Vincennes]] in the summer of 1778, at which he succeeded. When General [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], the British commander at [[Detroit]], retook Vincennes, Clark returned in a surprise march in February 1779 and captured Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Hayes Harrison, ''George Rogers Clark and the War in the West'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1782, Pennsylvania militiamen killed about a hundred neutral Native Americans in the [[Gnadenhütten massacre]]. In the last major encounters of the war, a force of 200 Kentucky militia was defeated at the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] in August 1782.

==Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis==
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}
[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown'' by ([[John Trumbull]], 1797)]]

The northern, southern, and naval theaters of the war converged in 1781 at [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. Cornwallis, having been ordered to occupy a fortified position that could be resupplied (and evacuated, if necessary) by sea, had settled in Yorktown, on the York River, which was navigable by sea-going vessels. Aware that the arrival of the French fleet from The West Indies would give the allies control of the Chesapeake, Washington began moving the American and French forces south toward Virginia in August. In early September, French naval forces defeated a British fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], cutting off Cornwallis' escape. When Washington arrived outside Yorktown, the combined Franco-American force of 18,900 men began [[Siege of Yorktown|besieging Cornwallis]] in early October. For several days, the French and Americans bombarded the British defenses, and then began taking the outer positions. Cornwallis decided his position was becoming untenable, and he surrendered his entire army of over 8,000 men on October 19, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ferrie, ''The World Turned Upside Down: George Washington and the Battle of Yorktown'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the surrender at Yorktown, King George lost control of Parliament to the peace party, and there were no further major military activities in North America. The British had 30,000 garrison troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy, p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt; The war continued elsewhere, including the siege of Gibraltar and naval operations in the East and West Indies, until peace was agreed in 1783.

==Treaty of Paris==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
In London, as political support for the war plummeted after Yorktown, British Prime Minister Lord North resigned in March 1782. In April 1782, the Commons voted to end the war in America. Preliminary peace articles were signed in Paris at the end of November, 1782; the formal end of the war did not occur until the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] (for the U.S.) and the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] (for the other Allies) were signed on September 3, 1783. The last British troops [[Evacuation Day (New York)|left New York City]] on November 25, 1783, and the United States [[Congress of the Confederation]] ratified the Paris treaty on January 14, 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris, ''The Peacemakers: The Great Powers and American Independence'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain negotiated the Paris peace treaty without consulting her Native American allies and ceded all Native American territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States. Full of resentment, Native Americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the United States in a series of treaties, but the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier in the coming years, the largest being the [[Northwest Indian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Benn (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; The British would continue to support the Indians against the new American nation especially when hostilities resumed 29 years later in the [[War of 1812]].

The United States gained more than it expected, thanks to the award of western territory. The other Allies had mixed-to-poor results. France made some gains over its nemesis, Great Britain, but its material gains were minimal and its financial losses huge. It was already in financial trouble and its borrowing to pay for the war used up all its credit and created the financial disasters that marked the 1780s. Historians link those disasters to the coming of the [[French Revolution]]. The Dutch clearly lost on all points. The Spanish had a mixed result; they did not achieve their primary war goal (recovery of Gibraltar), but they did gain territory. However in the long run, as the case of Florida shows, the new territory was of little or no value.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiographical431&quot;/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages of the opposing sides==
===The Americans===
The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. 
In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade.

The Americans had a large, relatively prosperous population (when compared to other colonies) that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, something the British could not sufficiently rely on. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army that the Congress set up.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'' ch 36–39&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting on their home ground, the Americans were also much more acclimatised to the climate than the British and their allies. 

At the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies, however battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;K405_48&quot;&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405–448&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the creation of the Continental Army to combat the British forces and their allies in North America, the army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as [[George Washington]], [[Horatio Gates]], [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], [[Richard Montgomery]] and [[Francis Marion]] all had military experience with the British Army during the [[French &amp; Indian Wars|French and Indian conflict]]. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]], which was used to train American troops up until the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_58.shtml Thomas Fleming] &quot;The Magnificent Fraud,&quot; ''American Heritage'', Feb./March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, they proved their ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]].

===The British===
The British were beset with major difficulties in fighting the war. Compared to the Americans, the British had no major allies, and only had troops provided by small German states to bolster the strength of the British Army in North America. At the onset of the war, the British Army was less than 48,000 strong worldwide, and suffered from a lack of effective recruiting. By 1778, the army was pardoning criminals for military service and had extended the age range for service to be from 16 to 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;netplaces1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Daniel P. |url=http://www.netplaces.com/american-revolution/the-fighting-men/the-british-army.htm |title=The British Army&amp;nbsp;— American Revolution |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Americanrevolution.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy3.html |title=The British Army&amp;nbsp;— Chapter Three |publisher=Americanrevolution.org|accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its officer and non-commissioned officer corps were relatively professional and experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P Murphy, ''The everything American revolution book'' (2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=V1nzK16XImwC&amp;pg=PT69 p 56 online]&lt;/ref&gt; this professionalism was diluted because wealthy individuals lacking military experience could purchase commissions and promotions. As a consequence, inexperienced officers sometimes found their way into positions of high responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;netplaces1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy1.html |title=The British Army&amp;nbsp;— Chapter One |publisher=Americanrevolution.org|accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance was also a major problem for the British. Although the Royal Navy was the largest and most experienced in the world at the time, it sometimes took months for troops to reach North America, and orders were often out of date because the military situation on the ground had changed by the time they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 306&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the British had logistical problems whenever they operated away from the coast; they were vulnerable to guerilla attacks on their supply chains whenever they went far inland. On a logistical note, the flints used in British weapons also put them at a disadvantage on the battlefield. British flints could only fire for 6 rounds before requiring re-sharpening, while American flints could fire 60 rounds before resharpening. A common expression ran among the redcoats; which was that &quot;Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; Although discipline was harsh in the army, the redcoats had little self-discipline; gambling, looting, promiscuity and heavy drinking were common problems, among all ranks alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; The army suffered from mediocre organisation in terms of logistics, food supplies were often bad and the sparse land of America offered little in the way of finding reliable substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy4.html |title=The British Army&amp;nbsp;— Chapter Four |publisher=Americanrevolution.org|accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Revolution Campaigns 1775 to 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of campaigns in the Revolutionary War]]

Suppressing a rebellion in America also posed other problems. At the onset of the war, the British had around 8,000 men stationed in North America, however these were required to cover an area that stretched from northern Canada to Florida, a distance of almost 2,000 miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; As the colonies had not been united before the war, there was no central area of strategic importance. In European conflicts, the capture of a capital city often meant the end of the war; however in America, when the British seized key cities such as New York, Philadelphia or Boston—or [[Washington D.C.]] in the [[War of 1812]] thirty years later—the war continued unabated. Furthermore, despite the fact that at its height, the British fielded some 56,000 men in the colonies exclusive of mercenaries and militia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Americanrevolution.org&quot;/&gt; they lacked the sufficient numbers to both defeat the Americans on the battlefield and simultaneously occupy the captured areas. It was not unusual for the Americans to suffer a string of defeats, only to have the British retreat because they could not occupy the captured land. Despite strong Loyalist support, these troops were often displaced by Patriot militia when British regulars were not in the area, demonstrated at battles such as [[Battle of Kings Mountain|Kings Mountain]]. The manpower shortage became critical when France, Spain and the Netherlands entered the war, as the British were spread across several theatres worldwide, when before they were concentrated only in America.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 306; Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;29, 42&lt;/ref&gt; The need to maintain Loyalist allegiance also provided setbacks, as the British could not use the harsh methods of suppressing rebellion they had used in Ireland and Scotland. Despite these limitations, neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Revolutionaries due to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–16 (Harsh methods), pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p.&amp;nbsp;16 (neutrals into revolutionaries)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs of the war==
===Casualties===

'''Americans &amp; Allies'''

The total loss of life throughout the war is largely unknown. As was typical in the wars of the era, disease claimed far more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782 a [[North American smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic]] swept across North America, killing more than 130,000 people. Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] against the [[smallpox]] epidemic was one of his most important decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Smallpox epidemic: Fenn, p.&amp;nbsp;275. A great number of these smallpox deaths occurred outside the theater of war—in Mexico or among Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. Washington and inoculation: Ellis, p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 25,000 American Revolutionaries died during active military service. About 8,000 of these deaths were in battle; the other 17,000 recorded deaths were from disease, including about 8,000–12,000 who died of starvation or disease brought on by deplorable conditions while [[POW|prisoners of war]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Burrows&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2008/5/2008_5_54.shtml Edwin G. Burrows] &quot;Patriots or Terrorists?,&quot; ''American Heritage'', Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; most in rotting British [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York. This tally of deaths from disease is undoubtedly too low, however; 2,500 Americans died while encamped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–78 alone. The number of Revolutionaries seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000. The total American military [[casualty (person)|casualty]] figure was therefore as high as 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;American dead and wounded: Shy, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p.&amp;nbsp;849.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''British &amp; Allies'''

About 171,000 sailors served in the Royal Navy during the war; about a quarter had been [[impressment|pressed]] into service. About 1,240 were killed in battle, while 18,500 died from disease. The greatest killer was [[scurvy]], a disease which had been shown to be preventable by issuing lemon or lime juice to sailors but was not taken seriously. Scurvy would be eradicated in the Royal Navy in 1790s by the chairman of the Navy's Sick and Hurt Board, [[Gilbert Blane]]. About 42,000 British sailors [[desertion|deserted]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy (1964), pp.&amp;nbsp;6, 176 (British seamen)&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 1,200 Germans were killed in action and 6,354 died from illness or accident. About 16,000 of the remaining German troops returned home, but roughly 5,500 remained in the United States after the war for various reasons, many eventually becoming American citizens. No reliable statistics exist for the number of casualties among other groups, including Loyalists, British regulars, Native Americans, French and Spanish troops, and civilians.

===Financial costs===
{{main|Financial costs of the American Revolutionary War}}

The British spent about £80 million and ended with a [[national debt]] of £250 million, which it easily financed at about £9.5 million a year in interest. The French spent 1.3 billion livres (about £56 million). Their total national debt was £187 million, which they could not easily finance; over half the French national revenue went to debt service in the 1780s. The debt crisis became a major enabling factor of the [[French Revolution]] as the government could not raise taxes without public approval.&lt;ref&gt;Tombs (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;179&lt;/ref&gt; The United States spent $37 million at the national level plus $114 million by the states. This was mostly covered by loans from France and the Netherlands, loans from Americans, and issuance of an increasing amount of paper money (which became &quot;not worth a continental&quot;). The U.S. finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s when [[Alexander Hamilton]] spearheaded the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--And Spain?--&gt;
