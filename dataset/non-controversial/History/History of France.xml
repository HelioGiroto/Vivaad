{{History of France}}

Stone tools indicate that early man was present in France at least 1.57 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;anthropology1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Tim |url=http://anthropology.net/2009/12/16/lithic-assemblage-dated-to-1-57-million-years-found-at-lezignan-la-cebe-southern-france/ |title=Lithic Assemblage Dated to 1.57 Million Years Found at Lézignan-la-Cébe, Southern France « |publisher=Anthropology.net |date= |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern humans appeared in the area 40,000 years ago. The first written records for the '''History of France''' appear in the [[Iron Age France|Iron Age]]. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as [[Gaul]]. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the [[Gauls]], the [[Aquitani]], and the [[Belgae]]. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were a [[Celts|Celtic]] people speaking what is known as the [[Gaulish language]].

Over the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans, and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] established colonies on the [[Mediterranean]] coast and the offshore islands. The [[Roman Republic]] annexed southern Gaul as the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the rest of Gaul in the [[Gallic Wars]] of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a [[Gallo-Roman culture]] emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the [[Roman Empire]].

In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to [[barbarian]] raids and migration, most importantly by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]]. The Frankish king [[Clovis I]] united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under [[Charlemagne]]. The medieval [[Kingdom of France]] emerged out of the western part of Charlemagne's [[Carolingian Empire]], known as [[West Francia]], and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the [[House of Capet]], founded by [[Hugh Capet]] in 987.

A [[Order of succession|succession]] crisis following the death of the last Capetian monarch in 1337 led to the series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] between the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The wars ended with a Valois victory in 1453, solidifying the power of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' as a highly centralized [[absolute monarchy]]. During the next centuries, France experienced the [[French Renaissance|Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], as well as recurring religious conflicts and wars with other powers. A burgeoning worldwide [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]] was established from the 16th century.

In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the [[French Revolution]], which forever changed French and world history. The country was governed for a period as a [[French First Republic|Republic]], until the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] was declared by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Following Napoleon's defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a [[Bourbon Restoration|monarchy]], then briefly as a [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and then as a [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], until a more lasting [[French Third Republic]] was established in 1870.

France was one of the [[Triple Entente]] powers in [[World War I]], fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, and [[Allies of World War I|their allies]] against the [[Central Powers]]. 

France was one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in [[World War II]], but was conquered by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by the [[Axis Powers]], while the south was controlled by the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. Following [[liberation of France|liberation]] in 1944, a [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was established.

This was succeeded in 1958 by the [[French Fifth Republic]], the country's current government. After the war [[decolonization]] saw most of the [[French colonial empire]] become independent, while other parts were incorporated into the French state as [[overseas department]]s and [[overseas collectivities|collectivities]]. Since World War II France has been a leading member in the UN, the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], and remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political influence in the 21st century.

[[Neanderthal]] man was present in Europe from about 200,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]], but died out about 30,000 years ago, possibly out-competed by the modern humans during a period of cold weather. The earliest modern humans – ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' – [[Early human migrations|entered Europe]] by 43,000 years ago (the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/science/fossil-teeth-put-humans-in-europe-earlier-than-thought.html?scp=1&amp;sq=kents%20cavern&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt; The cave paintings of [[Lascaux]] and Gargas (Gargas in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]]) as well as the [[Carnac stones]] are remains of the local prehistoric activity.

===Greek colonies===
{{main|Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul}}

In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|Greeks]] from [[Phocaea]] founded the [[Greek colonies|colony of Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]) on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], making it the oldest city of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I. E. S. Edwards, ed. |title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA754|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claude Orrieux|author2=Pauline Schmitt Pantel|title=A History of Ancient Greece|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA62|year=1999|publisher=Blackwell|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaul===
{{Main|Gaul}}
[[File:Massalia large coin 5th 1st century BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Massalia]] (modern [[Marseille]]) silver coin with Greek legend, a testimony to [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]], 5th–1st century BCE.]]
Covering large parts of modern day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Belgae]] tribes whom the Romans referred to as [[Gauls]] and who spoke the [[Gaulish language]] roughly between the [[Seine]] and the [[Garonne]] (''Gallia Celtica''). On the lower Garonne the people spoke [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], an archaic language related to [[Basque language|Basque]] whereas a [[Belgian language]] was spoken north of [[Lutecia]]. The Celts founded cities such as [[Lutetia|Lutetia Parisiorum]] (Paris) and [[Bordeaux|Burdigala]] (Bordeaux) while the Aquitanians founded [[Toulouse|Tolosa]] (Toulouse).

Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become [[Provence]]. The [[Phocaea|Phoceans]] founded important cities such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille) and [[Nice|Nikaia]] (Nice), bringing them in to conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as [[Pytheas]], were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]] invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the [[Battle of the Allia]].

However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them. The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as [[Battle of Sentinum|Sentinum]] and [[Battle of Telamon|Telamon]] during the 3rd century BC. In the early 3rd century BC, the Belgae conquered the surrounding territories of the [[river Somme|Somme]] in northern Gaul after a battle supposedly against the [[Armoricani]] near [[Ribemont-sur-Ancre]] and [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]], where sanctuaries were found.

When [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginian]] commander [[Hannibal (Barcid)|Hannibal Barca]] fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the [[Roman Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Later, the Consul of Gaul — [[Julius Caesar]] — conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by [[Vercingetorix]], the Overking of the Warriors, the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at [[Battle of Gergovia|Gergovia]], but were ultimately defeated at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] in 52 BC. The Romans founded cities such as [[Lyon|Lugdunum]] (Lyon) and [[Narbonne|Narbonensis]] (Narbonne).

===Roman Gaul===
{{Main|Roman Gaul}}
[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|[[Vercingetorix]] surrenders to [[Julius Caesar]] after [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]. Painting by Lionel-Noël Royer, 1899.]]
Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the [[Gaulish language]] by [[Vulgar Latin]]. It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and [[Latin]] languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by [[Gallo-Roman culture]].

The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, generals [[Marcus Antonius Primus]] and [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] were both born in Gaul, as were emperors [[Claudius]] and [[Caracalla]]. Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]'s capture by the Persians in 260, [[Postumus]] established a short-lived [[Gallic Empire]], which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the [[Franks]] and the [[Alamanni]], entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s victory at [[Battle of Châlons (274)|Châlons]] in 274.

A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in [[Armorica]]. They were led by the legendary king [[Conan Meriadoc]] and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], which evolved into the [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Welsh language]]s.

In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the [[Goths]] in exchange for their support against the [[Vandals]]. Those same Goths had previously sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse.

[[File:Gaul Soldiers.JPG|thumb|Gaulish soldiers]]
The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and [[Flavius Aëtius]] had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control.
He first used the [[Huns]] against the [[Burgundians]], and these mercenaries destroyed [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], killed king [[Gunther]], and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near [[Lugdunum]] in 443. The Huns, united by [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the [[Battle of Châlons]], in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila.

The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the [[Visigoths]], who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the [[Vascones]] entered [[Duchy of Vasconia|Wasconia]] from the Pyrenees and the [[Bretons]] formed three kingdoms in Armorica: [[Domnonia]], [[Cornouaille]] and [[Broërec]].&lt;ref&gt;P.

==Frankish kingdoms (486–987)==
{{Main|Francia}}
{{see also|List of Frankish kings|Merovingian|Carolingian Renaissance|Early Middle Ages}}

[[File:Steuben - Bataille de Poitiers.png|thumb|The [[Battle of Tours]] (732). This battle is often considered of macro-importance in European and Islamic history.]]
In 486, [[Clovis I]], leader of the [[Salian Franks]], defeated [[Syagrius]] at [[Battle of Soissons (486)|Soissons]] and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the [[Alamanni]] at [[Battle of Tolbiac|Tolbiac]]. In 496, [[pagan]] Clovis adopted [[Catholicism]]. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the [[Arian]] Visigoths. He defeated [[Alaric II]] at [[Battle of Vouillé|Vouillé]] in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Edward James, ''The Franks'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goths retired to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the [[Merovingian Dynasty]] but his kingdom would not survive his death in 511. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on [[Paris]], [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Rheims]].  Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently.  Also during this time, the [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]], originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

By this time Muslim invaders had [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered Hispania]] and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke [[Odo the Great]] defeated a major invading force at [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Toulouse]] in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated that raiding party at the [[Battle of Tours]] (although the battle took place between Tours and Poitiers) and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by [[Pepin the Short]] (son of Charles Martel) established the [[Carolingian dynasty]] as the Kings of the Franks.

[[File:Sacre de Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Charlemagne]]]]
Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepin's son, [[Charlemagne]]. In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the [[Lombards]] under [[Desiderius]] in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating [[History of Bavaria#Bavaria and the Agilolfings under Frankish overlordship|Bavaria]] (788) into his realm, defeating the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] of the [[Danube|Danubian]] plain (796), advancing the frontier with [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] as far south as [[Barcelona]] (801), and subjugating [[Lower Saxony]] after a prolonged campaign (804).

In recognition of his successes and his political support for the [[Papacy]], [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800. Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious]] (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I's death. Two of his sons – [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Louis the German]] – swore allegiance to each other against their brother – [[Lothair I]] – in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]], and the empire was divided among Louis's three sons ([[Treaty of Verdun]], 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of [[Henry the Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Wilson, ''Charlemagne'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Carolingian]]s, the kingdom was ravaged by [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|Viking raiders]]. In this struggle some important figures such as [[Odo, Count of Paris|Count Odo of Paris]] and his brother [[Robert I of France|King Robert]] rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the [[Robertian dynasty|Robertines]], were the predecessors of the [[Capetian Dynasty]]. Led by [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King [[Charles the Simple]], in order to protect the land from other raiders. The people that emerged from the interactions between the new Viking aristocracy and the already mixed Franks and Gallo-Romans became known as the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts|title=The Normans in Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IarkHmOdjnsC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2000|publisher=Manchester U.P.|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strong princes===
France was a very decentralised state during the [[Middle Ages]]. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like [[Normandy]], [[Flanders]] or [[Languedoc]] enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The [[House of Capet|Capetians]], as they were descended from the [[Robertians]], were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate [[Carolingian]] kings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1993&quot;&gt;Georges Duby, ''France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc'' (1993),&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carolingian]] kings had nothing more than a royal title when the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the [[Crown of Charlemagne]] and as [[Count of Paris]] they held their personal fiefdom, best known as [[Île-de-France (province)|Île-de-France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1993&quot;/&gt;

The fact that the Capetians both held lands as Prince as well as in the title of King gave them a complicated status. Thus they were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes but they also had a religious authority over [[Roman Catholicism in France]] as King. However, and despite the fact that the Capetian kings often treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates, their royal title was often recognised yet not often respected. The royal authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1993&quot;/&gt;

Some of the king's vassals would grow sufficiently powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The [[Normans]], the [[Plantagenets]], the [[Lusignans]], the [[Hautevilles]], the [[Ramnulfids]], and the House of [[Counts of Toulouse|Toulouse]] successfully carved lands outside of France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the [[Norman Conquest of England]] by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], following the [[Battle of Hastings]] and immortalised in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France.&lt;ref&gt;David Carpenter ''The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284'' p. 91: &quot;In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204... But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the king's absence, money which was above all needed across the channel&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the [[Crusader states]]. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the [[Krak des Chevaliers]]' enlargement by the Counts of [[Tripoli]] and [[Toulouse]].

===Rise of the monarchy===
The history of the monarchy is how it overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328, and the laws of [[primogeniture]] ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the [[Papacy, history|Church]], which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The [[First Crusade]] was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.&lt;ref name=&quot;google235&quot;/&gt;

The history of modern France starts with the election of [[Hugh Capet]] (940-996) by an assembly summoned in [[Reims]] in 987. Capet was previously &quot;Duke of the Franks&quot; and then became &quot;King of the Franks&quot; (Rex Francorum). Hugh's lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; his political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king's vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own.&lt;ref name=&quot;google235&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marvin Perry et al.|author3=Margaret Jacob|title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society: To 1789|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XMKpq_nV0J8C&amp;pg=PA235|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recorded to be recognised king by the [[Gauls]], [[Bretons]], [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Aquitanians]], [[Goths]], Spanish and [[Gascons]].  [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borell of Barcelona]] called for Hugh's help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]]. The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed, as the Spanish marches grew more and more independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;&gt;William W. Kibler, ed. ''Medieval France: An Encyclopedia'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europe's most powerful house of kings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|thumb|A view of the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], a [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery, was the centre of monastic life revival in the [[Middle Ages]] and marked an important step in the cultural rebirth following the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].]] 
Hugh's son – [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]] – was crowned King of the Franks before Capet's demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other's realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. Although a king weak in power, Robert II's efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he relied heavily on the Church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress — [[Bertha of Burgundy]] — and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt;  The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the [[Peace and Truce of God]] (beginning in 989) and the [[Cluniac Reforms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt;

Robert II crowned his son — [[Hugh Magnus of France|Hugh Magnus]] — as King of the Franks at age 10 to secure the succession, but Hugh Magnus rebelled against his father and died fighting him in 1025.

The next King of the Franks was Robert II's next son, [[Henry I of France|Henry I]] (reigned 1027-1060). Like Hugh Magnus, Henry was crowned as co-ruler with his father (1027), in the Capetian tradition, but he had little power or influence as junior king while his father still lived. Henry I was crowned after Robert's death in 1031, which is quite exceptional for a French king of the times. Henry I was one of the weakest kings of the Franks, and his reign saw the rise of some very powerful nobles such as William the Conqueror.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt; Henry I's biggest source of concerns was his brother — [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert I of Burgundy]] — who was pushed by his mother to the conflict. Robert of Burgundy was made Duke of Burgundy by King Henry I and had to be satisfied with that title. From Henry I onward, the Dukes of Burgundy were relatives of the King of the Franks until the end of the Duchy proper. 

[[File:Godefroi 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godefroy de Bouillon]], a French knight, leader of the [[First Crusade]] and founder of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].]]
[[Philip I of France|King Philip I]], named by his Kievan mother with a typically Eastern European name, was no more fortunate than his predecessor&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt; although the kingdom did enjoy a modest recovery during his extraordinarily long reign (1060–1108). His reign also saw the launch of the [[First Crusade]] to regain the [[Holy Land]], which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition.

It is from [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] (reigned 1108–1137) onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward Louis had the assistance of a skilled religious statesman, [[Abbot Suger]]. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the [[robber baron]]s. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1995&quot;/&gt;

Thanks to Abbot Suger's political advice, [[Louis VII of France|King Louis VII]] (junior king 1131–1137, senior king 1137–1180) enjoyed greater [[moral authority]] over France than his predecessors. Powerful vassals paid homage to the French king.&lt;ref&gt;Capetian France 937–1328 p. 64: &quot;Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Abbot Suger arranged the 1137 marriage between Louis VII and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in Bordeaux, which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in [[Vitry-en-Perthois|Vitry]] during the conflict against the Count of Champagne.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Paul Frankl, ''Gothic Architecture'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the [[Holy Land]]. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the [[Second Crusade]] but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope under the pretext of consanguinity and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy – [[Henry II of England|Henry Fitzempress]], who would become King of England as Henry II two years later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine. 

Abbot Suger's vision of construction became what is now known as [[Gothic architecture]]. This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the [[late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===The late Capetians (1165–1328)===
The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor.

====Philip II Augustus====
The reign of [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] (junior king 1179–1180, senior king 1180–1223) marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair.

[[File:Bataille de Bouvines gagnee par Philippe Auguste.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Philip II of France|Philip II]] victorious at [[Bouvines]] thus annexing Normandy and Anjou into his royal domains. This battle involved a complex set of alliances from three important states, the Kingdoms of France and England and the Holy Roman Empire.]]
Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called [[Angevin Empire]], which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England's son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II — [[Richard I of England|Richard Lionheart]] — and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry's castle and home of [[Chinon]] and removed him from power. Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the [[Third Crusade]] however their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France until Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II. 

Adding to their battles in France, the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. If Philip II Augustus supported [[Philip of Swabia]], member of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], then Richard Lionheart supported [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], member of the [[House of Welf]]. Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richard's demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. 

[[John of England|John Lackland]], Richard's successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the [[Lusignan]]s and, as Louis VI had done often to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John's possessions in France. John's defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the decisive [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214) resulted in complete failure. Philip II had annexed Normandy and Anjou, plus capturing the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders, although Aquitaine and Gascony remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In an additional aftermath of the [[Battle of Bouvines]], John's ally Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto IV]] was overthrown by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], member of the House of Hohenstaufen and ally of Philip. Philip II of France was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France.

Philip Augustus founded [[La Sorbonne|the Sorbonne]] and made Paris a city for scholars. 

[[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] (the future Louis VIII, reigned 1223–1226) was involved in the subsequent [[First Barons War|English civil war]] as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains.

====Saint Louis (1226–1270)====
France became a truly centralised kingdom under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (reigned 1226–1270). Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one dimensional character, a flawless representant of the faith and an administrative reformer who for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone: he made unsuccessful crusades, his expanding administrations raised opposition, and he burned Jewish books at the Pope's urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Gigot | first =Francis E.  | contribution =Judaism | year =1910 | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume =VIII | place=New York | publisher=Robert Appleton Company | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm | accessdate =13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis' vassals:&lt;ref&gt;Capetian France p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Louis9 profilebust.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis.]] He saw France's cultural expansion in the Western Christian world.]]

{{quote|''For it would be against God and contrary to right and justice if he compelled any man to seek absolution when the clergy were doing him wrong.''}}

Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France. His mother — [[Blanche of Castile]] — was the effective power as [[regent]] (although she did not formally use the title). Blanche's authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she maintained her position until Louis was old enough to rule by himself. 

In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting [[University of Paris strike of 1229|strike at the University of Paris]]. The [[Latin Quarter|Quartier Latin]] was strongly hit by these strikes. 

The kingdom was vulnerable: war was still going on in the County of Toulouse, and the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc. [[Raymond VII of Toulouse|Count Raymond VII of Toulouse]] finally signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands for life, but his daughter, married to [[Alfonso, Count of Poitou|Count Alfonso of Poitou]], produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France. 

[[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]] had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at [[Saint-Malo]] with a massive force. Henry III's allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king, who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the [[Saintonge War]] (1242). Ultimately, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IX's overlordship, although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The [[Conseil du Roi]], which would evolve into the [[Parlement]], was founded in these times.

After his conflict with [[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]], Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King. An amusing anecdote is about Henry III's attending the French [[Parlement]], as Duke of Aquitaine; however, the King of England was always late because he liked to stop each time he met a priest to hear the mass, so Louis made sure no priest was on the way of Henry III. Henry III and Louis IX then started a long contest for who was the most faithful; this evolved to the point that none ever arrived on time to the Parlement, which was then allowed to debate in their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Capetian France p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as [[Gothic architecture]]; his [[Sainte-Chapelle]] became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the [[Morgan Bible]]. 

The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the [[Seventh Crusade]] and the [[Eighth Crusade]]. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King. He died in the Eighth Crusade and [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] became king.

====Philip III and Philip IV (1270–1314)====

[[Philip III of France|Philip III]] became king when Saint Louis died in 1270 during the Eighth Crusade. Philip III was called &quot;the Bold&quot; on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback, and not because of his character or ruling abilities. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the [[Aragonese Crusade]], which cost him his life in 1285.

More administrative reforms were made by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], also called Philip the Fair (reigned 1285–1314). This king was responsible for the end of the [[Knights Templar]], signed the [[Auld Alliance]], and established the [[Parlement|Parlement of Paris]]. Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] and all the contemporary popes were French, such as Philip IV's puppet [[Pope Clement V|Bertrand de Goth, Pope Clement V]].

===The early Valois Kings and the Hundred Years' War (1328–1453)===
[[File:Capture Jean II.jpg|thumb|The capture of the French king [[John II of France|John II]] at [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] in 1356.]]
The tensions between the Houses of [[Plantagenet]] and [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] climaxed during the so-called [[Hundred Years' War]] (actually several distinct wars over the period 1337 to 1453) when the Plantagenets claimed the throne of France from the Valois. This was also the time of the [[Black Death]], as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the [[Treaty of Troyes]] [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France. 

It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years' War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by [[Joan of Arc]] (1412–1431). Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years' War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily. 

Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at the [[Battle of Baugé]] (1421), the humiliating defeats of [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] (1356) and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] (1415) forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] (reigned 1422–1461) established the first French standing army, the [[Compagnies d'ordonnance]], and defeated the Plantagenets once at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] (1429) and again, using cannons, at [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] (1450). The [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) was regarded as the last engagement of this &quot;war&quot;, yet [[Calais]] and the [[Channel Islands]] remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

==Early Modern France (1453–1789)==

===Life in the Early Modern period ===
{{main|Ancien Régime}}

====French identity====
France in the [[Ancien Régime]] covered a territory of around {{convert|200000|sqmi|km2}}. This land supported 13 million people in 1484 and 20 million people in 1700. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had 5 or 6 million, Spain had 8 million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around 8 million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France's lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Goubert, ''The Ancien Regime'' (1973) pp. 2-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of &quot;being French&quot; was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities.  By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves &quot;bon françois.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt;

====Estates and power====
Political power was widely dispersed.  The law courts (&quot;Parlements&quot;) were powerful, especially that of France.  However, the king had only about 10,000 officials in royal service — very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; The different [[estates of the realm]] – the clergy, the nobility, and commoners – occasionally met together in the &quot;[[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]&quot;, but in practice the Estates General had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws.

The Catholic Church controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king (not the pope) nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments.

The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity. Each noble had his own lands, his own network of regional connections, and his own military force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Frederick J. Baumgartner, ''France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1995) pp 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyons and Rouen each had about 40,000 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt;

Peasants made up the vast majority of population, who in many cases had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect.  In 1484, about 97% of France's 13 million people lived in rural villages; in 1700, at least 80% of the 20 million people population were peasants.

In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot;stable&quot; core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon1991&quot;&gt;James B. Collins, &quot;Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France.&quot; ''Journal of Social History'' 1991 24(3): 563-577. Issn: 0022-4529 Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]. For the ''Annales'' interpretation see Pierre Goubert, ''The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century'' (1986) [http://www.amazon.com/French-Peasantry-Seventeenth-Century/dp/0521312698/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1197851902&amp;sr=8-4 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the [[Annales School]] paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Collins, &quot;Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-Modern France,&quot; ''Journal of Social History'' (1991) 24#3 pp 563-577 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3787815 in JSTOR]  For the ''Annales'' interpretation see Pierre Goubert, ''The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century'' (1986) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521312698 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
{{Main|History of French}}
Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the French language became the preferred language of Europe's aristocracy. Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (born in 1500) quipped, &quot;I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCobBRiv3_MC&amp;pg=PA299|page=299|title=The letters of George Santayana: 1948–1952, Book 8|author=George Santayana, William G. Holzberger|publisher=MIT Press, 2008|isbn=0-262-19571-2|date=31 July2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] (b. 1494) helped to shape French as a literary language, Rabelais' French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words. [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] (born 1517) was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved [[Nicolas Chuquet]]'s [[Long and short scales|long scale]] system by adding names for intermediate numbers (&quot;milliards&quot; instead of &quot;thousand million&quot;, etc.).

===Consolidation (15th and 16th centuries)===
[[File:Weyden Karl der Kuehne.jpg|thumb|[[Charles the Bold]], the last Valois [[Duke of Burgundy]]. His death at the [[Battle of Nancy]] (1477) marked the division of his lands between the Kings of France and Habsburg Dynasty.]]
The death of [[Charles the Bold]], the last Valois [[Duke of Burgundy]], at the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477 was a pivotal, if under-recognised, moment in European history. The Duke of Burgundy had assembled a large territory, including his native duchy and the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. [[Louis XI of France|King Louis XI]] and later his allies, the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], faced [[Charles the Bold]] during the [[Burgundian Wars]] (1474–1477). France annexed the duchy, although the part of Burgundy that formed Franche-Comté was later given to [[Philip I of Castile]] in 1493. With Charles the Bold's death, his domains began an inevitable slide towards division between France and the Habsburgs (who through marriage to his heiress Mary became his heirs). Neither side was satisfied with the results and the disintegration of the Burgundian state was a factor in most major wars in Western Europe for more than two centuries.

From 1487 to 1491, France attacked and defeated Brittany, an independent duchy. In 1532, Brittany was [[Union between Brittany and France|incorporated]] into the Kingdom of France.

France engaged in the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] faced powerful foes, and he was captured at [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]. The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Ottoman Admiral Barbarossa]] captured Nice on 5 August 1543 and handed it down to Francis I. Around this same time, the [[Protestant Reformation]], led in France mainly by [[John Calvin]], was challenging the power of the Catholic Church in France. 

During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian [[Habsburgs]] were the dominant power in Europe. In addition to Spain and Austria, they controlled a number of kingdoms and duchies across Europe. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Quint]], under the titles of Count of Burgundy, Holy Roman Emperor, and King of Aragon, Castile and Germany, among others, encircled France. The [[Tercio|Spanish Tercio]] was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] seized Calais from the English.

===French Wars of Religion (1562–98)===
{{Main|French Wars of Religion}}

[[File:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|[[Henry IV of France]], King of [[List of French monarchs|France]] and [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Navarre]], was the first French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king.]]
France's population was mostly [[Roman Catholic]] but it too underwent upheaval during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. French Protestantism, which was largely [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], derived its support from the lesser nobles and trading classes. Its two main strongholds were southwest France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Protestantism in France was considered a grave threat to national unity, as the [[Huguenot]] minority felt a closer affinity to (and often allied themselves with) German and Dutch Calvinists than with their fellow Frenchmen. 

Renewed Catholic reaction – headed by the powerful [[Francis, Duke of Guise]] – led to a massacre of Huguenots at [[Wassy|Vassy]] in 1562, starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces.  King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] had died in 1559 in a jousting tournament, he was succeeded in turn by his three sons, each of which assumed the throne as minors or were weak, ineffectual rulers.  In the power vacuum entered Henry's widow, [[Catherine de' Medici]], who became a central figure in the early years of the Wars of Religion.  At her instigation, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572. 

The Wars of Religion culminated in the [[War of the Three Henrys (1584–1598)]],at the height of which bodyguards of the King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] assassinated [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise]], leader of the Spanish-backed [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic league]].  In revenge, a Dominican friar and partisan of the Catholic League, [[Jacques Clément]], assassinated Henry III.  This led to the ascension of the Huguenot King Henry of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] to the French throne.  In the interest of bringing peace to a country beset by religious and succession wars, Henry (now King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]) converted to [[Catholicism]].

Henry IV notably enacted the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598, which guaranteed religious liberties to the Protestants, thereby effectively ending the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;&gt;Mack P. Holt, ''The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629'' (2nd ed. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The main provisions of the [[Edict of Nantes]] were as follows: a) Huguenots were allowed to hold religious services in certain towns in each province, b) They were allowed to control and fortify eight cities (including [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]), c) Special courts were established to try Huguenot offenders, d)Huguenots were to have equal civil rights with the Catholics.

The military privileges (b, above) were incorporated in the Edict in order to allay the fears of the minority. Over time it became clear these privileges would be open to abuse and when in 1620 the Huguenots proclaimed a constitution for the 'Republic of the Reformed Churches of France', the Prime Minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (1585–1642) invoked the entire powers of the state.  

Religious conflicts therefore resumed under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] when Richelieu forced Protestants to disarm their army and fortresses. This conflict ended in the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] (1627–1628), in which Protestants and their English supporters were defeated. The following [[Peace of Alais]] (1629) confirmed religious freedom yet dismantled the Protestant defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;/&gt;

In the face of persecution, Huguenots dispersed widely throughout Protestant kingdoms in Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;Randy J. Sparks and Bertrand Van Ruymbeke, ''Memory and Identity: The Huguenots in France and the Atlantic Diaspora'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirty Years' War (1618–1648)===
{{Main|Thirty Years' War}}
The religious conflicts that plagued France also ravaged the Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire. The Thirty Years' War eroded the power of the Catholic Habsburgs. Although [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the powerful chief minister of France, had previously mauled the Protestants, he joined this war on their side in 1636 because it was in the [[National interest|''raison d'état'' (national interest)]]. Imperial Habsburg forces invaded France, ravaged [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], and nearly threatened Paris.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe’s Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Richelieu died in 1642 and was succeeded by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], while Louis XIII died one year later and was succeeded by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. France was served by some very efficient commanders such as [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Louis II de Bourbon]] (Condé) and [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne]] (Turenne). The French forces won a decisive victory at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] (1643), and the Spanish army was decimated; the Tercio was broken. The [[Truce of Ulm (1647)]] and the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) brought an end to the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;/&gt;

Some challenges remained. France was hit by civil unrest known as the [[Fronde]] which in turn evolved into the [[Franco-Spanish War (1653)|Franco-Spanish War]] in 1653. Louis II de Bourbon joined the Spanish army this time, but suffered a severe defeat at [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Dunkirk]] (1658) by Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne. The terms for the peace inflicted upon the Spanish kingdoms in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) were harsh, as France annexed Northern Catalonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;/&gt;

Amidst this turmoil, [[René Descartes]] sought answers to philosophical questions through the use of logic and reason and formulated what would be called [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian Dualism]] in 1641.

===Colonies (16th and 17th centuries)===
{{main|French colonial empire}}
During the 16th century, the king began to claim North American territories and [[French colonization of the Americas|established several (unsuccessful) colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hodson and Brett Rushforth,  &quot;Absolutely Atlantic: Colonialism and the Early Modern French State in Recent Historiography,&quot; ''History Compass,'' (Jan 2010) 8#1 pp 101-117,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Cartier]] was one of the great explorers who ventured deep into American territories during the 16th century. 

The early 17th century saw the first successful French settlements in the New World with the voyages of [[Samuel de Champlain]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Greer, &quot;National, Transnational, and Hypernational Historiographies: New France Meets Early American History,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (2010) 91#4 pp 695-724, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/canadian_historical_review/v091/91.4.greer.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest settlement was [[New France]], with the towns of [[Quebec City]] (1608) and [[Montreal]] (fur trading post in 1611, [[Roman Catholic]] mission established in 1639, and colony founded in 1642).

===Louis XIV (1643–1715)===
{{Main|Louis XIV of France}}

[[File:Ruiterportret Lodewijk XIV.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV of France]], the &quot;Sun King&quot;.]]
[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], known as the &quot;Sun King&quot;, reigned over France from 1643 until 1715 although his strongest period of personal rule did not begin until 1661 after the death of his Italian chief minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. Louis believed in the [[divine right of kings]], which asserts that a monarch is above everyone except God, and is therefore not answerable to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or the Church. Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from [[Paris]], sought to eliminate remnants of feudalism in France, and subjugated and weakened the aristocracy. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution. However, Louis XIV's long reign saw France involved in many wars that drained its treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;iearn1&quot;&gt;[http://www.iearn.hu/balkans/bpeople/zrinyi.htm Count Miklós Zrínyi,the Poet-Warlord]&lt;/ref&gt; 

His reign began during the Thirty Years' War and during the Franco-Spanish war. His military architect, [[Vauban]], became famous for his pentagonal fortresses, and [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] supported the royal spending as much as possible. French dominated [[League of the Rhine]] fought against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard]] in 1664. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the brave attack of 6,000 French troops led by La Feuillade and Coligny.&lt;ref name=&quot;iearn1&quot;/&gt; 

France fought the [[War of Devolution]] against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] in 1667. France's defeat of Spain and invasion of the Spanish Netherlands alarmed England and Sweden. With the [[Dutch Republic]] they formed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] to check Louis XIV's expansion. Louis II de Bourbon had captured [[Franche-Comté]], but in face of an indefensible position, Louis XIV agreed to a peace at [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aachen]]. Under its terms, Louis XIV did not annex Franche-Comté but did gain [[Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1968), the standard scholarly biography [http://www.questia.com/read/103250721 online edition]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace was fragile, and war broke out again between France and the Dutch Republic in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678). Louis XIV asked for the Dutch Republic to resume war against the Spanish Netherlands, but the republic refused. France attacked the Dutch Republic and was joined by England in this conflict. Through targeted inundations of [[polder]]s by breaking dykes, the French invasion of the Dutch Republic was brought to a halt.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated706&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ó Gráda |first=Cormac |coauthors=Chevet, Jean-Michel |year=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=62 |pages=706–733 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |pmid=17494233 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] inflicted a few strategic defeats on the Anglo-French naval alliance and forced [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|England to retire from the war]] in 1674. Because the Netherlands could not resist indefinitely, it agreed to peace in the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]], according to which France would annex France-Comté and acquire further concessions in the Spanish Netherlands. 

On 6 May 1682, the royal court moved to the lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], which Louis XIV had greatly expanded. Over time, Louis XIV compelled many members of the nobility, especially the noble elite, to inhabit Versailles. He controlled the nobility with an elaborate system of pensions and privileges, and replaced their power with himself.

Peace did not last, and war between France and Spain again resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated706&quot;/&gt; The [[War of the Reunions]] broke out (1683–1684), and again Spain, with its ally the Holy Roman Empire, was easily defeated. Meanwhile, in October 1685 Louis signed the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] ordering the destruction of all Protestant churches and schools in France. Its immediate consequence was a large Protestant exodus from France. The two massive [[famine]]s struck France between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated706&quot;/&gt;

France would soon be involved in another war, the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]. This time the theatre was not only in Europe but also in North America. Although the war was long and difficult (it was also called the Nine Years War), its results were inconclusive. The [[Treaty of Ryswick (Haiti)|Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697 confirmed French sovereignty over [[Alsace]], yet rejected its claims to [[Luxembourg]]. Louis also had to evacuate [[Catalonia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]]. This peace was considered a truce by all sides, thus war was to start again.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1701 the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. The Bourbon [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]] was designated heir to the throne of Spain as Philip V. The Habsburg [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] opposed a Bourbon succession, because the power that such a succession would bring to the Bourbon rulers of France would disturb the delicate [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe. Therefore, he claimed the Spanish thrones for himself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; England and the Dutch Republic joined Leopold against Louis XIV and Philip of Anjou. The allied forces were led by [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], and by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. They inflicted a few resounding defeats to the French army; the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704 was the first major land battle lost by France since its victory at Rocroi in 1643. Yet, the extremely bloody battles of [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] (1706) and [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] (1709) proved to be [[Pyrrhic victory|Pyrrhic victories]] for the allies, as they had lost too many men to continue the war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Led by [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars]], French forces recovered much of the lost ground in battles such as [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] (1712). Finally, a compromise was achieved with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Philip of Anjou was confirmed as Philip V, king of Spain; Emperor Leopold did not get the throne, but Philip V was barred from inheriting France.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Louis XIV wanted to be remembered as a patron of the arts, like his ancestor Louis IX. He invited [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] to establish the [[French opera]], and a tumultuous friendship was established between Lully and playwright and actor [[Molière]]. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] became France's most important architect of the period, bringing the pinnacle of [[French Baroque architecture]].

===Major changes in France, Europe, and North America (1718–1783)===
{{Main|Seven Years' War}}
{{see also|French Renaissance|French colonization of the Americas|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:Battle of Fontenoy 1745 1.PNG|thumb|The [[Battle of Fontenoy]], 11 May 1745.]]
Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great grandson who reigned as [[Louis XV]] until his death in 1774. In 1718, France was once again at war, as [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philip II of Orléans]]'s regency joined the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] against Spain. King [[Philip V of Spain]] had to withdraw from the conflict, confronted with the reality that Spain was no longer a great power of Europe. Under [[André-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury]]'s administration, peace was maintained as long as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie,  ''The Ancien Regime: A History of France 1610–1774'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in 1733 another war broke in central Europe, this time about the [[War of the Polish Succession|Polish succession]], and France joined the war against the Austrian Empire. This time there was no invasion of the Netherlands, and Britain remained neutral. As a consequence, Austria was left alone against a Franco-Spanish alliance and faced a military disaster. Peace was settled in the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]], according to which France would annex, through inheritance, the [[Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;/&gt; 

Two years later, in 1740, war broke out over the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian succession]], and France seized the opportunity to join the conflict. The war played out in North America and India as well as Europe, and inconclusive terms were agreed to in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. Once again, no one regarded this as a peace, but rather as a mere truce. [[Prussia]] was then becoming a new threat, as it had gained substantial territory from Austria. This led to the [[Diplomatic Revolution|Diplomatic Revolution of 1756]], in which the alliances seen during the previous war were mostly inverted. France was now allied to Austria and Russia while Britain was now allied to Prussia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Daniel Marston, ''The Seven Years' War'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North American theatre, France was allied with various Native American peoples during the [[Seven Years' War]] and, despite a temporary success at the battles of [[Battle of the Great Meadows|the Great Meadows]] and [[Braddock expedition|Monongahela]], French forces were defeated at the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in Quebec. In Europe, repeated French attempts to overwhelm [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] failed. In 1762 Russia, France and Austria were on the verge of crushing Prussia, when the [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian Alliance]] was saved by the [[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]]. At sea naval defeats against British fleets at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]] in 1759 and a crippling blockade forced France to keep its ships in port. Finally peace was concluded in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], and France lost its North American empire.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's success in the Seven Years War]] had allowed them to eclipse France as the leading colonial power.  France sought revenge for this defeat, and under [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] France started to rebuild. In 1766 the French Kingdom annexed Lorraine and the following year bought [[Corsica]] from [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]].

[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Cornwallis]] surrenders at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] to American and French allies.]]
Having lost its colonial empire, France saw a good opportunity for revenge against Britain in [[France in the American Revolutionary War|signing an alliance with the Americans in 1778, and sending an army and navy]] that turned the [[American Revolution]] into a world war. Spain, allied to France by the [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]], and the Dutch Republic also joined the war on the French side. [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] defeated a British fleet at [[Battle of the Chesapeake|Chesapeake Bay]] while [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette]] joined American forces in defeating the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The war was concluded by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]; the United States became independent. The British Royal Navy scored a major victory over France in 1782 at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] and France finished the war with huge debts and the minor gain of the island of [[Tobago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1985&quot;&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the state expanded, new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas flourished. [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]] proposed the [[separation of powers]]. Many other French philosophes (intellectuals) exerted philosophical influence on a continental scale, including [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose essay [[Social Contract (Rousseau)|The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right]] was a catalyst for governmental and societal reform throughout Europe. Diderot's great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' reshaped the European world view.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1998&quot;&gt;Daniel  Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998) ch 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics and technology flourished. French scientists such as [[Antoine Lavoisier]] worked to replace the archaic units of weights and measures by a coherent scientific system. Lavoisier also formulated the law of [[Conservation of mass]] and discovered oxygen and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1998&quot;/&gt;

===The Enlightenment===
{{main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[Image:ENC 1-NA5 600px.jpeg|thumb|Cover of the [[Encyclopédie]]]]  

The &quot;[[Philosophes]]&quot; were eighteenth century French intellectuals who dominated the [[French Enlightenment]] and were influential across Europe. Their interests were diverse, with experts in scientific, literary, philosophical and sociological matters. The ultimate goal of the philosophers was human progress; by concentrating on social and material sciences, they believed that a rational society was the only logical outcome of a freethinking and reasoned populace. They also advocated [[Deism]] and religious tolerance. Many believed religion had been used as a source of conflict since time eternal, and that logical, rational thought was the way forward for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hanns Reill and Ellen Judy Wilson, ''Encyclopædia of the Enlightenment''(2nd ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was Editor in Chief of the famous Enlightenment accomplishment, the 72,000 article ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772). It sparked a revolution in learning throughout the enlightened world.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Wilson, ''Diderot, the Appeal to Posterity, 1759-1784'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 18th century the movement was dominated by [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]], but the movement grew in momentum as the century moved on. Overall the philosophers were inspired by the thoughts of [[René Descartes]], the skepticism of the Libertins and the popularization of science by [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]. Sectarian dissensions within the church, the gradual weakening of the absolute monarch and the numerous wars of [[Louis XIV]] allowed their influence to spread.  Between 1748 and 1751 the Philosophes reached their most influential period, as  [[Montesquieu]] published ''Spirit of Laws'' (1748) and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] published ''Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences'' (1750). 

The leader of the French Enlightenment and a writer of enormous influence across Europe, was [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778). His many books included poems and plays; works of satire (''[[Candide]]'' [1759]); books on history, science, and philosophy, including numerous (anonymous) contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; and an extensive correspondence.  A witty, tireless antagonist to the alliance between the French state and the church, he was exiled from France on a number of occasions. In exile in England he came to appreciate British thought and he popularized [[Isaac Newton]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cronk, ed. ''The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution and Napoleon (1789–1815)==

===The Revolution===
{{Main|French Revolution}}

[[File:Anonymous - Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|[[Storming of the Bastille]], 14 July 1789]]
The immediate trigger for the Revolution was Louis XVI's attempts to solve the government's worsening financial situation. Recent wars, such as support of the [[American Revolutionary War]], compounded by the loss of the North American colonies, had effectively bankrupted the state. Several years of bad harvests and an inadequate transportation system had caused rising food prices, hunger, and malnutrition; the country was further destabilized by the lower classes' increased feeling that the royal court was isolated from, and indifferent to, their hardships.

In February 1787 his finance minister, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], convened an [[Assembly of Notables]], a group of nobles, clergy, [[bourgeoisie]], and bureaucrats selected in order to bypass the local parliaments. This group was asked to approve a new [[land tax]] that would, for the first time, include a tax on the property of nobles and clergy. The assembly did not approve the tax, instead demanding that Louis XVI call the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]]. 

In August 1788 the King agreed to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General in May 1789]]. While the Third Estate demanded and was granted &quot;double representation&quot; so as to balance the First and Second Estate, voting was to occur &quot;by orders&quot; – votes of the Third Estate were to be weighted – effectively canceling double representation. This eventually led to the Third Estate breaking away from the Estates-General and, joined by members of the other estates, proclaiming the creation of the [[National Assembly]], an assembly not of the Estates but of &quot;the People.&quot; In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. After finding the door to their chamber locked and guarded, the Assembly met nearby on a tennis court and pledged the [[Tennis Court Oath]] on 20 June 1789, binding them &quot;never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances demand, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and affirmed on solid foundations.&quot; They were joined by some sympathetic members of the Second and First estates. After the king fired his finance minister, [[Jacques Necker]], for giving his support and guidance to the Third Estate, worries surfaced that the legitimacy of the newly formed National Assembly might be threatened by royalists. 

Paris was soon consumed with riots, anarchy, and widespread looting. Because the royal leadership essentially abandoned the city, the mobs soon had the support of the French Guard, including arms and trained soldiers. On 14 July 1789, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which also served as a symbol of royal tyranny. Insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|seized the Bastille prison]], killing the governor and several of his guards. The French now celebrate 14 July each year as a symbol of the shift away from the [[Ancien Régime]] to a more modern, democratic state. [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Gilbert du Motier]], a hero of the War of American Independence, took command of the National Guard, and the king was forced to recognize the [[Cockade|Tricolour Cockade]]. Although peace was made, several nobles did not regard the new order as acceptable and emigrated in order to push the neighboring, aristocratic kingdoms to war against the new democratic regime. Because of this new period of instability, the state was struck for several weeks in July and August 1789 by the [[Great Fear]], a period of violent class conflict. 

The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] was adopted by the National Assembly in August 1789 as a first step in their effort to write a constitution. Considered to be a precursor to modern international rights instruments and using the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] as a model, it defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of all of the estates as one. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights were deemed universal and valid in all times and places, pertaining to human nature itself. The Assembly also replaced France's historic provinces with eighty-three departments, uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in extent and population. On 4 August 1789, the Assembly abolished feudalism, in what became known as the [[August Decrees]], sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate (nobility) and the tithes gathered by the First Estate (clergy). In the course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies, and cities lost their special privileges. The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the Ancien Régime – armorial bearings, liveries, etc. – which alienated the more conservative nobles. Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed [[guilds]], masterships, and workers' organizations. Consequently, an individual could only gain the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license, and worker strikes became illegal.

The Revolution brought about a massive shifting of powers from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to the state. Under the Ancien Régime, the Church had been the largest landowner in the country. Legislation enacted in 1790 abolished the Church's authority to levy a tax on crops, cancelled special privileges for the clergy, and confiscated Church property. The Assembly essentially addressed the financial crisis in part by having the nation take over the property of the Church. 

The republican government also enforced the [[International System of Units|Système International d'Unités]] (International System of Units), commissioned by Louis XVI, which became known as the Metric System. [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] and [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s works on electricity and electromagnetism were also recognised, and their units are integrated into the Metric System.

When a mob from Paris attacked the royal palace at Versailles in October 1789 seeking redress for their severe poverty, the royal family was forced to move to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. Later in June 1791, the royal family secretly fled Paris in disguise for Varennes near France's northeastern border in order to seek royalist support the king believed he could trust, but they were soon discovered en route. They were brought back to Paris, after which they were essentially kept under house-arrest at the Tuileries. 

Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The opposition to revolution sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly. The &quot;Royalist democrats&quot; or monarchiens inclined toward organizing France along lines similar to the British constitutional model. The &quot;National Party&quot;, representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly, represented somewhat more extreme views. The increasingly middle-class National Guard under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right. With most of the Assembly still favoring a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groupings reached a compromise. Under the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]], France would function as a constitutional monarchy with Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead. The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, although he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. He had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to [[de facto]] [[abdication]].

The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791 and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants]] (constitutional monarchists) on the right, about 330 [[Girondists]] (liberal republicans) in the center, a vocal group of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] (radical revolutionaries) on the left, and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with any of those factions. Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the [[émigrés]] with death and that decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Over the course of a year, disagreements like this would result in a constitutional crisis, leading the Revolution to higher levels.

On the foreign affairs front, in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] of August 1791, Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], [[Charles X of France|Count Charles of Artois]], and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] made Louis XVI's cause their own. These noblemen also required the Assembly to be dissolved through threats of war, but, instead of cowing the French, it infuriated them. The borders were militarised as a consequence. Under the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]], the solution of a constitutional monarchy was adopted, and the king supported a war against Austria in order to increase his popularity, starting the long [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. On the night of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August]], the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], who had mainly opposed the war, suspended the monarchy. With the Prussian army entering France, more doubts were raised against the aristocracy, and these tensions climaxed during the [[September Massacres]]. 

After the first great victory of the French revolutionary troops at the [[Battle of Valmy]] on 20 September 1792, the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed the next day, on 21 September 1792. The new [[French Republican Calendar]] was then legally enforced. 

The National Convention was fractured into factions, the most dangerous of which became the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]]. The [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondist|Girondins]] were both originally [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], a political club which was founded according to republican beliefs and whose members wanted a French democratic republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Richard Censer|author2=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC|year=2001|publisher=Penn State U.P. |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobin Club, however, encountered political tension beginning in 1791 due to conflicting viewpoints in response to several revolutionary events and how to best achieve a democratic republic.&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The Terror'' p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Members of &quot;The Mountain&quot; (French: ''La Montagne'') sided with the Parisian militants, also known as the ''sans-culottes'', who aimed for a more repressive form of government that would institute a price maximum on essential consumer goods and would punish all traitors and enemies of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Censer, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' pp. 64,74&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, between war and political differences, the Montagnards believed these crises required emergency solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Gough, ''The Terror in the French Revolution'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Montagnards considered themselves the true patriots of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David. The Terror. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The Mountain had 302 members during its reign in 1793 and 1794, including committee members and deputies who voted with the faction.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Alison. &quot;Political Divisions in the French National Convention 1792–93&quot; p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its members came from the middle class and tended to represent the Parisian population.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R.R.

Twelve Who Ruled. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This party eventually gained overwhelming power in the Convention and governed France during the [[Reign of Terror]].

[[File:Fusillades de Nantes.jpg|thumb|240px|Mass shootings at Nantes, [[War in the Vendée]], 1793]]
Possibly the two most significant factors in the quarrel and consequential split between the Montagnards and the Girondins include the [[September Massacres]] and the [[trial of Louis XVI]], both in 1792. The official fall of the monarchy came on 10 August 1792 after Louis XVI refused to rescind his veto of the National Assembly's constitution. The Mountain argued for immediate execution of the king by military court-martial, insisting that he was undermining the Revolution. Because a trial would require the &quot;presumption of innocence,&quot; such a proceeding would contradict the mission of the National Convention. The Girondins, in contrast, agreed that the king was guilty of treason but argued for his clemency and favored the option of exile or popular referendum as his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Censer, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'' pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; However, the trial progressed and Louis XVI was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793. 

The second key factor in the split between the Montagnards and the Girondins was the September Massacres of 1792. Radical Parisians, members of the National Guard, and fédérés were angry with the poor progress in the war against Austria and Prussia and the forced enlistment of 30,000 volunteers. On 10 August, radicals went on a killing spree, slaughtering roughly 1,300 inmates in various Paris prisons, many of whom were simply common criminals, not the treasonous counterrevolutionaries condemned by the Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Higonnet, ''Goodness Beyond Virtue'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The Girondins did not tolerate the massacres, but neither the Montagnards of the Legislative Assembly nor the [[Paris Commune]] took any action to stop or condemn the killings. Members of the Girondins later accused Marat, Robespierre, and Danton as inciters of the massacres in an attempt to further their dictatorial power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Hanson, ''The Jacobin Republic Under Fire'' p. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Execution of Louis XVI in what is now the Place de la Concorde, facing the empty pedestal where the statue of his grandfather, [[Louis XV]], had stood.]]
When the [[Brunswick Manifesto (1792)|Brunswick Manifesto]] of July 1792 once more threatened the French population with Austrian (Imperial) and Prussian attacks, Louis XVI was suspected of treason and taken along with his family from the Tuileries Palace in August 1792 by insurgents supported by a new revolutionary Paris Commune. The King and Queen ended up prisoners, and a rump session of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy. Little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. The King was later tried and convicted and, on 21 January 1793, was executed by the guillotine. Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine on 16 October. 

What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. When the Commune sent gangs into prisons to arbitrarily adjudicate and butcher 1400 victims, and then addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France, inviting them to follow this example, the Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. This situation persisted until a National Convention, charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new de facto government of France. The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. 

Members of the Mountain went on to establish the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in April 1793 under Robespierre, which would be responsible for [[Reign of Terror|The Terror]] (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794), the bloodiest and one of the most controversial phases of the French Revolution. The time between 1792 and 1794 was dominated by the ideology of the Mountain until the execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794. 

The war went badly. Prices rose, the ''sans-culottes'' (poor labourers and radical Jacobins) rioted, and counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup, backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian ''sans-culottes''. An alliance of Jacobin and ''sans-culottes'' elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical. 

Starting in September 1793, a period known as the [[Reign of Terror]] ensued for approximately 12 months, the bloodiest and one of the most controversial phases of the French Revolution. The [[Committee of Public Safety]], set up by the National Convention on 6 April 1793, formed the twelve-member de facto executive government of France. Under war conditions and with national survival seemingly at stake, the Montagnard Jacobins under [[Maximilien Robespierre]] centralized denunciations, trials, and executions. At least 18,000 people met their deaths under the guillotine or otherwise, after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities. In 1794, Robespierre had ultra-radicals and moderate Jacobins executed. As a consequence of these actions, however, Robespierre's own popular support eroded markedly. On 27 July 1794, the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror and, after taking power, they took revenge as well by banning the Jacobin Club and executing many of its former members – including Robespierre – in what was known as the [[First White Terror|White Terror]]. 

After the stated aim of the National Convention to [[export revolution]], the guillotining of Louis XVI of France, and the French opening of the Scheldt, a European military coalition was formed and set up against France. Spain, Naples, Great Britain, and the Netherlands joined Austria and Prussia in [[First Coalition|The First Coalition]] (1792–1797), the first major concerted effort of multiple European powers to contain Revolutionary France. It took shape after the wars had already begun. The Republican government in Paris was radicalised after a diplomatic coup from the Jacobins said it would be the [[Total war|''Guerre Totale'']] (&quot;total war&quot;) and called for a ''[[Levée en masse]]'' (mass conscription of troops). Royalist invasion forces were defeated at [[Siege of Toulon|Toulon]] in 1793, leaving the French republican forces in an offensive position and granting a young officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, a certain fame. Following their victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]], the Republicans occupied Belgium and the Rhineland. An invasion of the Netherlands established the puppet [[Batavian Republic]]. Finally, a peace agreement was concluded between France, Spain, and Prussia in 1795 at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]]. 

The Convention approved a new &quot;[[Constitution of the Year III]]&quot; on 17 August 1795; it was ratified by a national plebiscite and took effect on 26 September 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution created the Directory and the first bicameral legislature in French history. The parliament consisted of 500 representatives – ''le Conseil des Cinq-Cents'' (the Council of the Five Hundred) – and 250 senators – ''le Conseil des Anciens'' (the Council of Elders). Executive power went to five &quot;directors&quot;, named annually by the ''Conseil des Anciens'' from a list submitted by ''le Conseil des Cinq-Cents''. The nation desired rest and the healing of its many wounds. Those who wished to restore Louis XVIII and the Ancien Régime and those who would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number. The possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the First Coalition. 

Nevertheless, the four years of the Directory were a time of arbitrary government and chronic disquiet. The late atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between the parties impossible. As the majority of French people wanted to be rid of them, they could achieve their purpose only by extraordinary means. The Convention habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, when the elections went against them, appealed to the sword. They resolved to prolong the war as the best expedient for prolonging their power. They were thus driven to rely upon the armies, which also desired war and were becoming increasingly less civic in temper.

The Directory lasted until 1799 when [[Napoleon]] staged a coup and installed [[French Consulate|The Consulate]]. The Consulate still operated within the First Republic. The Consulate was replaced by the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], established by Napoleon in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nicholls|title=Napoleon: A Biographical Companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PmCdv91zPS0C&amp;pg=PA81|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Napoleonic Era===
{{See also|Napoleonic wars}}
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon]] on his Imperial throne, by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]].]]
During the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792–1797), the [[French Directory|Directoire]] had replaced the National Convention. Five directors then ruled France. As Great Britain was still at war with France, a plan was made to [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|take Egypt]] from the Ottoman Empire, a British ally. This was [[Napoleon]]'s idea and the Directoire agreed to the plan in order to send the popular general away from the mainland. Napoleon defeated the Ottoman forces during the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] (21 July 1798) and sent hundreds of scientists and linguists out to thoroughly explore modern and ancient Egypt. Only a few weeks later the British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Horatio Nelson]] unexpectedly destroyed the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] (1–3 August 1798). Napoleon planned to move into Syria but was defeated and he returned to France without his army, which surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Strathern, ''Napoleon in Egypt'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directoire was threatened by the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] (1798–1802). Royalists and their allies still dreamed of restoring the monarchy to power, while the Prussian and Austrian crowns did not accept their territorial losses during the previous war. In 1799 the Russian army expelled the French from Italy in battles such as [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Cassano]], while the Austrian army defeated the French in Switzerland at [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]] and [[First Battle of Zürich|Zurich]]. Napoleon then seized power through a coup and established the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in 1799. The Austrian army was defeated at the [[Battle of Marengo (1800)]] and again at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden (1800)]]. While at sea [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|the French]] had some success at Boulogne but Nelson's Royal Navy destroyed an anchored Danish and Norwegian fleet at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]] because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade of France. The Second Coalition was beaten and peace was settled in two distinct treaties: the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] and the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802-3, during which Napoleon [[Louisiana Purchase|sold French Louisiana]] to the United States because it was indefensible.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Nafziger, ''Historical Dictionary of the Napoleonic Era'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801 Napoleon concluded  a &quot;Concordat&quot; with Pope Pius VII that opened peaceful relations between church and state in France. The policies of the Revolution were reversed, except the Church did not get its lands back. Bishops and clergy were to receive state salaries, and the government would pay for the building and maintenance of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Aston, ''Religion and revolution in France, 1780-1804'' (2000) p 324&lt;/ref&gt;  Napoleon reorganized higher learning by dividing the ''Institut National'' into four (later five) academies. 

Of permanent importance was the [[Napoleonic Code]] created by eminent jurists under Napoleon's supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of Jews where it took effect.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander  Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children.  The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Goubert, ''The Course of French History'' (1991) ch 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=Napoléon at the Battle of Austerlitz, by François Gérard|Napoléon at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], by [[François Gérard]]]]
In 1804 Napoleon was titled Emperor by the senate, thus founding the [[First French Empire]]. Napoleon's rule was constitutional, and although autocratic, it was much more advanced than traditional European monarchies of the time.  The proclamation of the French Empire was met by the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]]. The French army was renamed ''[[La Grande Armée]]'' in 1805 and Napoleon used propaganda and nationalism to control the French population. The French army achieved a resounding victory at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] (16–19 October 1805), where an entire Austrian army was captured. However, a Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] (21 October 1805) and all plans to invade Britain were then made impossible. Despite this naval defeat, it was on the ground that this war would be won, Napoleon inflicted the Austrian and Russian Empires one of their greatest defeats at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (also known as the &quot;Battle of the Three Emperors&quot; on 2 December 1805), destroying the Third Coalition. Peace was settled in the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]; the Austrian Empire lost the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was created by Napoleon over former Austrian territories.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Goetz, ''1805: Austerlitz: Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition,'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]]. Although the Coalition was joined by other allies, the French Empire was also not alone since it now had a complex network of allies and submitted states. Largely outnumbered, the Prussian army was crushed at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806; Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] (14 June 1807). Peace was dictated in the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], in which Russia had to join the [[Continental System]] and Prussia handed down half of its territories to France. The [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers.

[[File:Napoleoniceurope.png|thumb|left|The height of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]]]]
Freed from his obligation in the east, Napoleon then went back to the west, as the French Empire was still at war with Britain. Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)]], a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] abdicated. This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese fought the French using [[guerilla tactics]], defeating the French forces at the [[Battle of Bailén]] (June and July 1808). Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the [[Convention of Sintra]] following the Allied victory at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]] (21 August 1808). France was only controlling [[Catalonia]] and [[Navarre]] and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not. Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as &quot;an avalanche of fire and steel.&quot; However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], yet was beaten at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at [[Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn]] (April 1809). Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn|peace treaty]] in October 1809 stripped Austria of a large amount of territories, reducing it even more.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|Napoleon Bonaparte retreating from Moscow, by [[Adolf Northern]]]]
In 1812 war broke out with Russia, engaging Napoleon in the disastrous [[French invasion of Russia (1812)]]. Napoleon assembled the largest army Europe had ever seen, including troops from all submitted states, to invade Russia, which had just left the continental system and was gathering an army on the Polish frontier. Following an exhausting march and the bloody but inconclusive [[Battle of Borodino]], near Moscow, the Grande Armée entered and captured Moscow, only to find it burning as part of the Russian [[scorched earth]] tactics. Although there still were battles such as [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets|Maloyaroslavets]] the Napoleonic army left Russia in late 1812 annihilated, most of all by the Russian winter, exhaustion, and scorched earth warfare. On the Spanish front the French troops were defeated at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]] (June 1813) and then at the [[Battle of the Pyrenees]] (July–August 1813). Since the Spanish guerrillas seemed to be uncontrollable, the French troops eventually evacuated Spain. 

Since France had been defeated on these two fronts, states previously conquered and controlled by Napoleon saw a good opportunity to strike back. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] was formed, and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was largely defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] outside Leipzig in October 1813, and was overwhelmed by much larger armies during the [[Six Days Campaign]] (February 1814), although, the Six Days Campaign is often considered a tactical masterpiece because the allies suffered much higher casualties.

Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, and was exiled to [[Elba]]. The [[Conservative Order|conservative]] [[Congress of Vienna]] reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon's attempted restoration, a period known as the [[Hundred Days]], ended with his final defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. 

The monarchy was subsequently restored and [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] became king.

==Long nineteenth century, 1815–1914==
{{Main|France in the long nineteenth century}}

===Religion===
France remained basically Catholic. The 1872 census of 1872, counted 36 million people, of whom 35.4 million were listed as Catholics, 600,000 as Protestants, 50,000 as Jews and 80,000 as freethinkers  The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church, seeing it as a bastion of conservatism and monarchism. However the monasteries with their vast land holdings and political power were gone; much of the land had been sold to urban entrepreneurs who lacked historic connections to the land and the peasants. Few new priests were trained in the 1790-1814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790  to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly.  Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gildea, ''Children of the Revolution: The French, 1799-1914''(2008) p 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The comeback was slow—very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and a new emphasis on liturgy and devotions to the Virgin Mary, plus support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback.  In 1870 there were 56,500 priests, representing a much younger and more dynamic force in the villages and towns, with a thick network of schools, charities and lay organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Price, ''A Social History of Nineteenth-Century France'' (1987) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820-1830, but most often played secondary  political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age.  Vol. I: The 19th Century in Europe; Background and the Roman Catholic Phase'' (1958) pp 400-412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945'' (1977) vol 2 pp 983-1040&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bourbon restoration: 1814–1830===

This period of time is called the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and was marked by conflicts between reactionary [[Ultra-royalists]], who wanted to restore the pre-1789 system of absolute monarchy, and liberals, who wanted to strengthen constitutional monarchy. Louis XVIII was the younger brother of Louis XVI, and reigned from 1814 to 1824. On becoming king, Louis issued a constitution known as the Charter which preserved many of the liberties won during the French Revolution and provided for a parliament composed of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers that was nominated by the king. However the right to vote in elections to the Chamber of Deputies was restricted to only the wealthiest men. Louis was succeeded in turn by a younger brother, Charles X, who reigned from 1824 to 1830. On 12 June 1830 [[Jules, prince de Polignac|Polignac]], [[Charles X of France|King Charles X]]'s minister, exploited the weakness of the Algerian [[Dey]] by invading Algeria and establishing [[French rule in Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the news of the fall of Algiers had barely reached Paris when a new revolution broke out and quickly resulted in a change of regime.

===July Monarchy 1830–1848===
Protest against the absolute monarchy was in the air. The elections of deputies to the 16 May 1830 had gone very badly for King Charles X.&lt;ref&gt;Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959) p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles X reacted by proroguing the Chamber of Deputies and sending them all packing, and then unilaterally changed the electoral laws in an attempt to create a new Chamber of Deputies more favorable to him, and muzzled the press. Opposition to the absolute monarchy was immediately expressed in the streets of Paris as suppressed deputies, gagged journalists, students from the University and many working men of Paris poured into the streets and erected barricades during the &quot;three glorious days&quot; (French '''Les Trois Glorieuses''') of 26–29 July 1830. Charles X was deposed and replaced by [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] in what is known as the [[July Revolution]]. The July Revolution is traditionally regarded as a rising of the bourgeoisie against the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. Participants in the July Revolution included Marie Joseph Paul Ives Roch [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette]].  Working behind the scenes on behalf of the bourgeois propertied interests was [[Louis Adolphe Thiers]]. Thiers was perfectly willing to see changes made in the government so long as property was not harmed. Thiers wanted the &quot;middle class accommodated&quot; with the vote, realizing that the [[petit bourgeoisie|petty bourgeoisie]] (owners of small business ventures) supported property interests, in spite of their being ruined by the rise of the larger bourgeoisie.  Lafayette believed the Orleanist constitutional monarchy was the safest course for the propertied interests and so Lafayette and Thiers became supporters of the Orleanist &quot;Citizen King&quot;--[[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]. Consequently, Louis-Philippe became &quot;king by the grace of the barricades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959) p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Louis-Philippe's &quot;[[July Monarchy]]&quot; (1830–1848) was dominated by the ''haute bourgeoisie'' (high bourgeoisie) of bankers, financiers, industrialists and merchants. 

During the reign of the July Monarchy, [[Romanticism|the Romantic Era]] was starting to bloom. Driven by the Romantic Era, an atmosphere of protest and revolt was all around in France. On 22 November 1831 in Lyon (the second largest city in France) the silk workers revolted and took over the town hall in protest of recent salary reductions and working conditions. This was one of the first occasions of a workers revolt in the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959)  p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was vigorously put down by [[Casimir Perier]]. The Right was also unhappy with the July Monarchy. On 28 October 1836, Prince Louis-Napoleon, son of Napoleon's brother, Louis, King of Holland attempted to overthrow the July Monarchy in a ''coup d'état''. It failed but in August 1840, Prince Louis Napoleon tried another ''coup'' at Boulogne with hired soldiers. It failed as well.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Guedalla, ''The Second Empire'' (1923) pp. 18-90, 120-26.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the constant threats to the throne, the July Monarchy began to rule with a stronger and stronger hand. Soon political meetings were outlawed.  However, &quot;banquets&quot; were still legal and all through 1847, there was a nation-wide campaign of democracy and/or republican banquets. The climaxing banquet was scheduled for 22 February 1848 in Paris but the government banned it. In response citizens of all classes poured out onto the streets of Paris in a revolt against the July Monarchy. Demands were made for abdication of &quot;Citizen King&quot; Louis-Philippe and for establishment of a representative democracy in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=23–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative classes in this revolt included the full range of French society from the industrial bourgeoisie (who had been excluded from the &quot;finance aristocracy&quot; that formed the major part of the bourgeoisie that supported the July Monarchy), the petty bourgeoisie and the workers. Louis-Philippe abdicated, and the [[French Second Republic]] was proclaimed. A Constituent Assembly was elected which was seated in Paris. [[Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine]], who had been a leader of the moderate republicans in France during the 1840s became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional Government that was established by this Assembly. In reality Lamartine was the virtual head of government in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer, ''France in the nineteenth century, 1830-1890'' (1892) [http://books.google.com/books?id=itvQAAAAMAAJ ch 7 pp 125-49 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Napoleon Bonaparte as the Second Republic and as Napoleon III: 1848–1871===
[[File:Franz Xaver Winterhalter Napoleon III.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III, Emperor of the French]]
Frustration among the laboring classes arose when the Constituent Assembly did not address the concerns of the workers. Strikes and worker demonstrations became more common as the workers gave vent to these frustrations. These demonstrations reached a climax when on 15 May 1848, workers from the secret societies broke out in armed uprising against the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies being pursued by the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Government. Fearful of a total breakdown of law and order, the Provisional Government invited General [[Louis Eugene Cavaignac]] back from Algeria, in June 1848, to put down the worker's armed revolt. From June 1848 until December 1848 General Cavaignac became head of the executive of the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;William Fortescue, ''France and 1848: the end of monarchy'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]] was elected president on 10 December 1848 by a landslide. His support came from a wide section of the French public. Various classes of French society voted for Louis Napoleon for very different and often contradictory reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, ''France and 1848: the end of monarchy'' (2005) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Louis Napoleon, himself encouraged this contradiction by &quot;being all things to all people.&quot;  One of his major promises to the peasantry and other groups was that there would be no new taxes.  The new [[National Constituent Assembly]] was heavily composed of royalist symphathizers of both the Legitimist (Bourbon) wing and the Orleanist (Citizen King Louis Phiippe) wing. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Louis Napoleon's political positions, his agenda as president was very much in doubt. For prime minister, he selected [[Odilon Barrot]], an unobjectionable middle-road parliamentarian, who had led the &quot;loyal opposition&quot; under Louis-Philippe. Other appointees represented various royalist factions.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. B. Corley, ''Democratic Despot: A Life of Napoleon III'' (1961) pp. 74-77&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Pope]] had been forced out of Rome as part of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000 man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General [[Charles Oudinot|Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot]] to restore him. In late April 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by [[Giuseppi Garibaldi]]'s volunteer corps, then recovered and recaptured Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the &quot;June Days&quot; of 1849, demonstrations against the government broke out and were suppressed. Leaders were arrested, including prominent politicians. The government banned several democratic and socialist newspapers in France; the editors were arrested.  [[Karl Marx]] was at risk so he moved  to London in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge U.P.  |pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government sought ways to balance its budget and reduce its debts. Toward this end, [[Hippolyte Passy]] was appointed Finance Minister.  When the Legislative Assembly met at the beginning of October 1849, Passy proposed an income tax to help balance the finances in France. The bourgeoisie, who would pay most of the tax, protested. The furor over the income tax caused the resignation of Barrot as prime minister, but a new wine tax also caused protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge U.P.  |pages=117–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The 1850 elections resulted in a conservative body.  It passed the [[Falloux Laws]], giving education into the hand of the Catholic clergy.  It opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the [[Jules Ferry laws]] reversed course in 1879. The Falloux Laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula were similar in Catholic and state schools. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Harrigan, &quot;Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment,&quot; ''Canadian Journal of History,'' (2001) 36#1 pp 51-83&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a new electoral law was passed that respected the principle of universal (male) suffrage, the stricter residential requirement of the new law actually had the effect of disenfranchising 3,000,000 of 10,000,000 voters.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'', pp. 305-306.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As 1851 opened, Louis Napoleon was not allowed by the Constitution of 1848 to seek re-election as President of France.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Guedalla, ''The Second Empire'' p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead he proclaimed himself President for Life following a coup in December that was confirmed and accepted in a dubious referendum.

[[Napoleon III]] of France took the imperial title in 1852 and held it until his downfall in 1870. The era saw great industrialization, urbanization (including the massive rebuilding of Paris by [[Baron Haussmann]]) and economic growth, but Napoleon III's foreign policies were not so successful. In 1854, The Second Empire joined the [[Crimean War]], which saw France and Britain opposed to the Russian Empire, which was decisively defeated at [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Sevastopol]] in 1854-1855 and at [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]] (1854). In 1856 France joined the [[Second Opium War]] on the British side against China; a missionary's murder was used as a pretext to take interests in southwest Asia in the [[Treaty of Tientsin]].

In 1859 the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] broke out between the northern Italian kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and Austria. The Second French Empire joined the war on the Italian side, which was concluded by an Austrian defeat at [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]]. In return for this intervention, Piedmont ceded the [[County of Nice]] (which included the city of [[Nice]] and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. 

In 1861 Napoleon III largely supported [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] in his claim to Mexico, a move that was also supported by Britain and Spain but condemned by the U.S. This led to the [[French intervention in Mexico]], which turned out to be a failure. Republicans took the capital and executed Maximilian in 1867, depriving France of the hoped-for [[Roman Catholic]] ally in [[North America]].

When France was negotiating with the Netherlands about purchasing Luxembourg in 1867, the Prussian Kingdom threatened the French government with war. This &quot;[[Luxembourg Crisis]]&quot; came as a shock to French diplomats as there previously was an agreement between the Prussian and French governments about Luxembourg. Napoleon III suffered stronger and stronger criticism from Republicans like [[Jules Favre]], and his position seemed more fragile with the passage of time.

France was looking for more interests in Asia. The country [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|interfered in Korea]] in 1866 taking, once again, missionaries' murders as a pretext. The French finally withdrew from the war with little gain but war's booty. The next year a [[French Military Mission to Japan (1867-1868)|French expedition to Japan]] was formed to help the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] to modernize its army. However, Tokugawa was defeated during the [[Boshin War]] at the [[Battle of Toba-Fushimi]] by large Imperial armies.

Rising tensions in 1869 about the possible candidacy of Prince [[Leopold von Hohenzollern]]-Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain caused a rise in the scale of animosity between France and Germany.&lt;ref name=koch&gt;H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' (Dorset Press, New York, 1978) pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Leopold was a part of the Prussian royal family. He had been asked by the Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] to accept the vacant throne of Spain.&lt;ref name=koch/&gt; Such an event was more than France could possibly accept. Relations between France and Germany deteriorated, and finally the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) broke out. German nationalism united the German states, with the exception of Austria, against Napoleon III. The French Empire was defeated decisively at [[Siege of Metz|Metz]] and [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]]. Indeed, Emperor Louis Napoleon III surrendered himself and 100,000 French troops to the German troops at Sedan on 1–2 September 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Guérard, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two days later, on 4 September 1870, [[Leon Gambetta]] proclaimed a new republic in France.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic'' (Simon &amp; Schuster: New York, 1969) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Later when Paris was encircled by German troops, Gambetta fled Paris by means of a hot air balloon and he became the virtual dictator of the war effort which was carried on from the rural provinces.&lt;ref name=g325&gt;Guérard, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Metz remained under siege until 27 October 1870, when 173,000 French troops were located there finally surrendered.&lt;ref name=g325/&gt; Surrounded Paris and was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871.&lt;ref name=g325/&gt; The last straw was the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]]. The [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] allowed the newly formed German Empire to annex the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.&lt;ref name=g326&gt;Guérard, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernisation and railways (1870 to 1914)===
{{main|History of rail transport in France}}
The seemingly timeless world of the French peasantry swiftly changed from 1870 to 1914. French peasants had been poor and locked into old traditions until railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription modernized rural France. The centralized government in Paris had the goal of creating a unified nation state, so it required all students be taught standardized French. In the process a new national identity was forged.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1890–1914'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

Railways became a national medium for the modernization of traditionalistic regions, and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]]. In 1857 an army colonel hoped that railways might improve the lot of &quot;populations two or three centuries behind their fellows&quot; and eliminate &quot;the savage instincts born of isolation and misery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugen Weber|title=Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870-1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4KnC4ROsiwwC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1976|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus in the south some lines that cut east to west). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency. After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances, and even minute technical details. The central government department of Ponts et Chaussées (roads and bridges) brought in British engineers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition, and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks, and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers. Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Bourse in Paris, so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Emile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it. The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses, and imported manufactured products. Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political, and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Third Republic and the Belle Epoque: 1871–1914===
{{Main|French Third Republic}}

====Third Republic and the Paris Commune====
Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), German Cancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] proposed harsh terms for peace — including the German occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.&lt;ref name=g326/&gt; A new French National Assembly was elected to consider the German terms for peace. Elected on 8 February 1871, this new National Assembly was composed of 650 deputies.&lt;ref name=g326/&gt; 

Sitting in Bourdeaux, the French National Assembly established the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. However, 400 members of the new Assembly were monarchists.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic'' Simon and Schuster: New York, 1969) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Leon Gambetta]] was one of the &quot;non-monarchist&quot; Republicans that were elected to the new National Assembly from Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959)  p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;) On 16 February 1871 [[Adolphe Thiers]] was elected to be the chief executive of the new Republic.  Because of the revolutionary unrest in Paris, the center of the Thiers government was located at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. 

[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|A barricade in the Paris Commune, 18 March 1871]]
In late 1870 to early 1871, the workers of Paris rose up in premature and unsuccessful small-scale uprisings.  The National Guard within Paris had become increasingly restive and defiant of the police, the army chief of staff, and even their own National Guard commanders. Thiers immediately recognized a revolutionary situation and, on 18 March 1871, sent regular army units to take control of artillery that belonged to the National Guard of Paris. However, some soldiers of the regular army units fraternized with the rebels and the revolt escalated. The barricades went up just as in 1830 and 1848. The [[Paris Commune]] was born. Once again the ''[[Seat of local government|Hotel de Ville]]'', or Town Hall, became the center of attention for the people in revolt; this time the ''Hotel de Ville'' became the seat of the revolutionary government. Other cities in France followed the example of the Paris Commune, as in Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse. However, all of these Communes outside Paris were promptly crushed by the Thiers government.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Schulkind, ed. ''The Paris Commune 1871'' pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An election on 26 March 1871 in Paris produced a government based on the working class.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] was in prison but a majority of delegates were his followers, called &quot;[[Blanquists]].&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The minority comprised anarchists and followers of [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1855);{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} as anarchists, the &quot;Proudhonists&quot; were supporters of limited or no government and wanted the revolution to follow an ''ad hoc'' course with little or no planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Analysis of arrests records indicate the typical communard was opposed to the military, the clerics, the rural aristocrats.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} He saw the bourgeoisie as the enemy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After two months the French army moved in to retake Paris, with pitched battles fought in working-class neighborhoods. Hundreds were executed in front of the [[Communards' Wall]], while thousands of others were marched to Versailles for trials. The number killed during ''La Semaine Sanglante'' (&quot;The Bloody Week&quot; of 21–28 May 1871) was perhaps 30,000, with as many as 50,000 later executed or imprisoned; 7,000 were exiled to [[New Caledonia]]; thousands more escaped to exile.  The government won approval for its actions in a national referendum with 321,000 in favor and only 54,000 opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick H. Hutton et al., eds. ''Historical Dictionary of the Third French Republic, 1870-1940'' (Greenwood, 1986) p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political battles====
The Republican government next had to confront counterrevolutionaries who rejected the legacy of the [[1789 Revolution]]. Both the [[Legitimist]]s (embodied in the person of [[Henri, Count of Chambord]], grandson of Charles X) and the [[Orleanist]] [[monarchist|royalist]]s rejected republicanism, which they saw as an extension of [[modernity]] and atheism, breaking with France's traditions. This conflict became increasingly sharp in 1873, when Thiers himself was censured by the National Assembly as not being &quot;sufficiently conservative&quot; and resigned to make way for Marshal [[Patrice MacMahon]] as the new president.&lt;ref&gt;Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959), pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the rumors of right-wing intrigue and/or coups by the Bonapartists or Bourbons in 1874, the National Assembly set about drawing up a new constitution that would be acceptable to all parties. 

The new constitution provided for universal male suffrage and called for a bi-cameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The initial republic was in effect led by pro-royalists, but republicans (the &quot;[[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party (historical)|Radicals]]&quot;) and [[Bonapartism|Bonapartists]] scrambled for power. The first election under this new constitution – held in early 1876 – resulted in a republican victory, with 363 republicans elected as opposed to 180 monarchists.  However, 75 of the monarchists elected to the new Chamber of Deputies were Bonapartists.&lt;ref name=sh39&gt;William L. Shirer, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;Bonapartist threat&quot; of a [[coup d'état]] was an ever-present danger in these early days of the Republic. Under the constitution, President MacMahon was required to pick a &quot;premier&quot; to actually lead the day-to-day affairs of the government. The most natural leader to pick following this republican victory at the polls would have been [[Leon Gambetta]].&lt;ref name=sh39/&gt; However, the old Marshal was dead set against Gambetta and chose, instead, moderate [[Armand Dufaure]].&lt;ref name=sh39/&gt; Dufaure tried to form a government but he was quickly overthrown. Next, Marshall MacMahon chose conservative [[Jules Simon]]. He was too conservative for the Chamber of Deputies and Simon was forced to resign on 16 May 1877, setting the stage for the &quot;Crisis of the Sixteenth of May.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Fortescue|title=The Third Republic in France, 1870-1940: Conflicts and Continuities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VzfBh4eQsPQC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[16 May 1877 crisis]] eventually led to the resignation of royalist [[Marshal MacMahon]] in January 1879. During his life [[Henri, comte de Chambord]], as the grandson of Charles X, had refused to abandon the ''[[fleur-de-lys]]'' and the [[white flag]]. Thus, Henri's own short-sightedness in this regard jeopardized the alliance between Legitimists (Bourbons) and Orleanists. Therefore, the monarchist cause remained divided and did not present as strong a threat to the Third Republic as might have been the case had they been unified. Because of this division, many remaining Orleanists rallied themselves to the Republic, behind Adolphe {{lang|fra|Thiers}}. The vast majority of the Legitimists abandoned the political arena or became marginalised. Still they remained a potent threat of trouble for the young Third Republic; Count Henri's death on 24 August 1883 removed a large threat to the Third Republic. Marshal MacMahon's successor as President of the Republic on 30 January 1879 was [[Jules Grevy]]. In January 1886, [[Georges Boulanger]] became Minister of War. Georges Clemanceau was instrumental in obtaining this appointment for Boulanger. This was the start of the Boulanger era and another time of threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Augustus Tilley|title=Modern France: A Companion to French Studies|year=1967|publisher=CUP Archive|page=170|id=GGKEY:KFSQL2KCR5A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the death of Henri Count of Chabord, the Legitimist (Bourbon) party was limited within the political arena within France. Some of them founded ''[[Action Française]]'' in 1898, during the [[Dreyfus Affair]]; it became an influential movement throughout the 1930s, in particular among the conservative Catholic intellectuals. 

The period from 1879 to 1899 saw power in the hands of moderate republicans and former &quot;radicals&quot; (around [[Léon Gambetta]]); these were called the &quot;Opportunists&quot;.

====Foreign policy====
French foreign policy was based on a fear of Germany—whose larger size and fast-growing economy could not be matched—combined with a revanchism that demanded the return of Alsace and Lorraine. At the same time, in the midst of the [[Scramble for Africa]], French and British interest in Africa came into conflict. The most dangerous episode was the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898  when French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to be acting in the interests of the [[Khedive of Egypt]] arrived. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Brogan, ''France under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1930)'' (1940) pp 321-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suez Canal]], initially built by the French, became a joint British-French project in 1875, as both saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and empires in Asia.  In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France. France's leading expansionist [[Jules Ferry]] was out of office, and the government allowed Britain to take effective control of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848-1918'' (1954) pp 286-92&lt;/ref&gt;

France had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. During his visit to France, [[Iwakura Tomomi]] asked for French assistance in reforming Japan. French military missions were sent to Japan in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872-1880)|1872–1880]], in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1884-1889)|1884–1889]] and the last one much later in [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)|1918–1919]] to help modernize the Japanese army.  Conflicts between the Chinese Emperor and the French Republic over Indochina climaxed during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884–1885). [[Amédée Courbet|Admiral Courbet]] destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at [[Battle of Foochow|Foochow]]. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into [[Tonkin]] and [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]].&lt;ref name=wak&gt;Frederic Wakeman, Jr., ''The Fall of Imperial China'' (Free Press: New York, 1975) pp. 189–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain, first by means of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, then the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907 which became the [[Triple Entente]]. This alliance with Britain and Russia against Germany and Austria eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France's Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848-1918'' (1954) pp 345, 403-26&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dreyfus Affair====
Distrust of Germany, faith in the army, and native French [[anti-semitism]] combined to make the [[Dreyfus Affair]] (the unjust trial and condemnation of a Jewish military officer for treason in 1894) a political scandal of the utmost gravity. For a decade, the nation was divided between &quot;dreyfusards&quot; and &quot;anti-dreyfusards&quot;, and far-right Catholic agitators inflamed the situation even when proofs of Dreyfus's innocence came to light. The writer [[Emile Zola]] published an impassioned editorial on the injustice, and was himself condemned by the government for libel. Dreyfus was finally pardoned in 1906. The upshot was a weakening of the conservative element in politics.  Moderates were deeply divided over the [[Dreyfus Affair]], and this allowed the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]] to hold power from 1899 until World War I. During this period, crises like the threatened  &quot;Boulangist&quot; coup d'état (1889) showed the fragility of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Paul Read, ''The Dreyfus Affair: The Scandal That Tore France in Two'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tour Eiffel 1878.jpg|thumb|Eiffel Tower under construction in July 1888.]]

====Religion 1870-1940====
Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the Monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and of boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Rigoulot, &quot;Protestants and the French nation under the Third Republic: Between recognition and assimilation,&quot; ''National Identities,'' March 2009, Vol. 11 Issue 1, pp 45–57&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1882 school laws of Republican [[Jules Ferry]] set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanincal morality but no religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett B. Singer, &quot;Minoritarian Religion and the Creation of a Secular School System in France,&quot; ''Third Republic'' (1976) #2 pp 228-259&lt;/ref&gt; For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated.  Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Harrigan, &quot;Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment,&quot; ''Canadian Journal of History,'' April 2001, 36#1 pp 51–83&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leo XIII]] became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal ''La  Croix''. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry]] (1899–1902) and the [[Émile Combes|Combes Ministry (1902–05)]] fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903–04), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Tallett and Nicholas Atkin, ''Religion, society, and politics in France since 1789'' (1991) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1805 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were finally separated.]]  All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches.  In practise, Masses and rituals continued.  The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests.  In the long run, however, it gained autonomy—for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gildea, ''Children of the Revolution: The French, 1799–1914'' (2010)  ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;

====The ''belle époque''====
The period at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century is often termed the ''[[belle époque]]''. France during this time is associated with cultural innovations and popular amusements – [[cabaret]], [[can-can]], the [[film|cinema]], new art forms such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].

In 1889 the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] took place in Paris, and the [[Eiffel Tower]] was built as a temporary gate to the fair. Meant to last only a few decades, the tower was never removed and became France's most iconic landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lucien Hervé|author2=Barry Bergdoll|title=The Eiffel Tower|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XJvlC5e8Hb8C&amp;pg=PA16|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France was nevertheless a nation divided internally on notions of religion, class, regionalisms, and money. On the international front, France came repeatedly to the brink of war with the other imperial powers, such as the 1898 [[Fashoda Incident]] with Great Britain over East Africa. [[World War I]] was inevitable, but its human and financial costs would be catastrophic for the French.

Preoccupied with internal problems, France played little attention to foreign policy in the 1911-14 period, although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating [[July crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] caught France unawares, and it played only a small role in [[Causes of World War I|the coming of World War I]].  The Serbian crisis triggered a complex set of formal and secret military alliances between European states, causing most of the continent, including France, to be drawn into war within a few short weeks. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in late July, triggering Russian mobilization. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered mobilization. Germany was much better prepared militarily than any of the other countries involved, including France. Later on that day the German Empire, as an ally of Austria, declared war on Russia. France was allied with Russia and so was ready to commit to war against the German Empire.  On 3 August Germany declared war on France, going through Belgium.  Britain entered the war on 4 August, and started sending in troops on 7 August.

[[File:Retreat news.jpg|upright|thumb|A French woman returns when the Germans retreat from her district and finds her home in ruins.]]

[[Schlieffen Plan|Germany's plan]] was to quickly defeat the French. They captured [[city of Brussels|Brussels]] by 20 August and soon had captured a large portion of northern France. The original plan was to continue southwest and attack Paris from the west. By early September they were within 40 miles of Paris, and the French government had relocated to Bordeaux. The Allies finally stopped the advance northeast of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne River]] (5–12 September 1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holger H. Herwig|title=The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uIYgL6NKyMwC&amp;pg=PA40|year=2011|publisher=Random House|pages=266–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war now became a stalemate — the famous &quot;[[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]&quot; was fought largely in France and was characterized by very little movement despite extremely large and violent battles, often with new and more destructive military technology. On the Western Front the small improvised trenches of the first few months rapidly grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. The land war quickly became dominated by the muddy, bloody stalemate of [[Trench warfare]], a form of war in which both opposing armies had static lines of defense. The war of movement quickly turned into a war of position. Attack followed others counterattack after counterattack. Neither side advanced much, but both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. German and Allied armies produced essentially a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium. The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as &quot;[[no man's land]]&quot; (for its lethal uncrossability) and varied in width depending on the battlefield; on the Western Front it was typically between 100 and 300 yards (90–275 m), though sometimes much less. The common infantry soldier had four weapons to use in the trenches: the rifle, bayonet, shotgun, and hand grenade, but the only defense against machine guns and artillery was to stay low in the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. D. Sheffield|title=War on the Western Front|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2tZK2eEqM_gC&amp;pg=PA194|year=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from September 1914 until March 1918.  Famous battles in France include [[Battle of Verdun]] (spanning 10 months from 21 February to 18 December 1916), [[Battle of the Somme]] (1 July to 18 November 1916), and five separate conflicts called the [[Battle of Ypres]]&lt;!--direction to disambiguation page is intentional, since it shows all five battles--&gt; (from 1914 to 1918). 

Britain introduced the [[Mark I tank|first tanks]] to the war, while Renault enhanced the concept by [[Renault FT-17|adding a turret]]. The use in large quantity of these light tanks by [[Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne|Jean-Baptiste Estienne]] can be considered a decisive evolution in World War I's strategies. 

When Russia exited the war in 1917 due to revolution, the [[Central Powers]] controlled all of the Balkans and could now shift military efforts to the Western Front. The U.S. had entered the war also in 1917, so the Central Powers hoped victory could be achieved mostly prior to America's delivery of full military support. In March 1918 Germany launched the last major offensive on the Western Front. By May Germany had reached the Marne again, as in September 1914, and was again close to Paris. However, in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] (15 July to 6 August 1918), the Allies were able to defend and then shift to offense due in part to German fatigue and the arrival of more Americans.

The Germans, out of reinforcements, were overwhelmed day after day and the high command saw it was hopeless. Austria and Turkey collapsed, and the Kaiser's government fell. Germany signed a surrender – &quot;[[Armistice with Germany|The Armistice]]&quot; – that ended the fighting effective 11 November 1918, &quot;the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.&quot; 

[[File:Council of Four Versailles.jpg|thumb|The Council of Four (from left to right): [[David Lloyd George]], [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]], [[Georges Clemenceau]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Versailles]]
Peace terms were imposed by the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]], meeting in Paris in 1919: [[David Lloyd George]] of Britain, [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy, [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States, [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy, and [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France. Clemenceau demanded the harshest terms and won most of them in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.  Germany was forced to admit its guilt for starting the war, and was permanently weakened militarily. Germany had to pay huge sums in [[war reparations]] to the Allies (who in turn had large loans from the U.S. to pay off). France regained Alsace-Lorraine. France occupied the German industrial [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar Basin]], a coal and steel region. The [[German colonial empire|German African colonies]] were put under  [[League of Nations]] mandates, and were administered by France and other victors. From the remains of the [[Ottoman Empire]], France acquired the [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate of Syria]] and the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Mandate of Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick O. Cohrs|title=The Unfinished Peace After World War I: America, Britain And the Stabilisation of Europe, 1919-1932|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nOWP-VD8k9cC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] wanted a peace that would never allow Germany to be a threat to France again, but after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed he said, ''This is not a peace. It is an armistice for 20 years.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Beatrice Henig|title=Versailles and After, 1919-1933|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gjwd2ZFT2OoC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1995|publisher=Psychology Press|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war was fought in large part on French soil, with 1.4&amp;nbsp;million French dead including civilians, and four times as many military casualties.

===Interwar years===
Foch supported Poland in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] and in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and France also joined Spain during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]].  From 1925 until his death in 1932, [[Aristide Briand]], as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with [[Weimar Germany]] as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the [[League of Nations]]. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s'' (1996) p 125&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defences called the [[Maginot Line]], designed to fight off any German attack. (Unfortunately, the Maginot Line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940.) Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920–1921, called the &quot;[[Little Entente]]&quot;. 

The French economy fell into the [[doldrums]] during the worldwide [[Great Depression]] after 1929. [[Leon Blum]], leading the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], brought together Socialists and Communists to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; he was the first Jew to lead France. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) he did not support the Spanish Republicans because of the French internal political context of complex alliances and risk of war with Germany and Italy.

[[Appeasement]] of Germany, in cooperation with Britain,  was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace even in the face of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s violations of the Versailles treaty and his escalating demands.  [[Édouard Daladier]] refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as [[Neville Chamberlain]] wanted to save peace at [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Thomas|title=Britain, France and Appeasement: Anglo-French Relations in the Popular Front Era|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TJXqvBz3JHcC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1996|publisher=Berg|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|General de Gaulle speaking on the [[BBC]] during the war.]] --&gt;
Germany's [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 finally caused France and Britain to declare war against Germany. But the Allies did not launch massive assaults and kept a defensive stance: this was called the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Drôle de guerre'' – the funny sort of war – in France. It did not prevent the German army from conquering Poland in a matter of weeks with its innovative [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics and helped by the Soviet Union's attack on Poland. When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, the [[Battle of France]] began in May 1940, and the same [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics proved just as devastating there. The [[Wehrmacht]] bypassed the [[Maginot Line]] by marching through the Ardennes forest. A second German force was sent into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] to act as a diversion to this main thrust. In six weeks of savage fighting the French lost 90,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Many civilians sought refuge by taking to the roads of France: some 2 million refugees from Belgium and Holland were joined by between 8 and 10 million French civilians, representing a quarter of the French population, all heading south and west. This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947.

Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the French leaders surrendered on 24 June 1940 after the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] was evacuated from [[Dunkirk]]. Nazi Germany occupied three-fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government. 

[[Vichy France]] was established on 10 July 1940 to govern the unoccupied part of France and its colonies. The Vichy Regime – led by [[Philippe Pétain]], the aging war hero of the [[First World War]] – was originally intended to be a temporary, care-taker regime, to supervise French administration before the soon-expected defeat of Britain. Instead, it lasted four years. It was unique among the various collaborating regimes of wartime Europe in that it was established constitutionally, through the French parliament. The Vichy regime sought to collaborate with Germany, keeping peace in France to avoid further occupation although at the expense of personal freedom and individual safety. For example, 76,000 Jews would be deported during the German occupation, often with the help of the Vichy French authorities, and murdered in the Nazis' [[extermination camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton, ''Vichy France, Old Guard and New Order'', New York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also Frenchmen who joined the German [[SS]] and served in the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Charlemagne Division]]. Yet despite extensive collaboration, the Vichy regime engaged a programme of arresting German intelligence agents in the unoccupied zone, with the purpose of preserving Vichy's sovereignty;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kitson, ''Vichy et la Chasse aux Espions Nazis'', Paris, Autrement, 2005; Simon Kitson, ''The Hunt for Nazi Spies'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; around 2,000 were arrested and some were subsequently executed. 

French [[brigadier general]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] declared himself on [[Radio Londres]] to be the head of a rival government in exile, and gathered the [[Free French Forces]] around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain and the USA. After the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]] in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of [[Vichy France]], that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the [[Battle of Dakar]]. Eventually, several important French ships such as the [[French battleship Richelieu (1939)|Richelieu]] and the [[Surcouf (N N 3)|Surcouf]] joined the Free French Forces. On the Eastern Front the USSR was lacking pilots and several French pilots joined the Soviet Union and fought the Luftwaffe in the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron. 

[[File:Normandy Invasion, June 1944.jpg|thumb|Allied invasion of Normandy, [[D-Day]], 1944]]
Within France proper, very few people organized themselves against the German Occupation in the summer of 1940. However, their numbers grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. Isolated opposers eventually formed a real movement: [[French Resistance|the Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;H. R. Kedward, ''In Search of the Maquis'' (Oxford, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous figure of the French resistance was [[Jean Moulin]], sent in France by de Gaulle in order to link all resistance movements; he was captured and tortured by [[Klaus Barbie]] (the &quot;butcher of Lyon&quot;). Increasing repression culminated in the complete destruction and extermination of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], at the height of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] (June 1944).

In November 1942 Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces, because the war in North Africa was coming to an end; the Germans foresaw a threat in southern Europe by the allied forces.

On 6 June 1944 the Allies [[D-Day|landed in Normandy]]; on 15 August Allied forces [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]] included 260,000 men of the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]].  All that summer, Allied forces fought their way through France. [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|General Leclerc]] [[Liberation of Paris|liberated Paris]] between 19 and 25 August 1944. The Alsace capital of [[Strasbourg]] was liberated by Leclerc's French troops on 23 November 1944.  The French army recruited [[French Forces of the Interior]] (de Gaulle's formal name for resistance fighters) to continue the war until the final defeat of Germany; this army numbered 300,000 men by September 1944 and 370,000 by Spring 1945.

The Vichy regime flew to Germany when Paris was freed, and the interim [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] was quickly put into place by the Free French. The ''gouvernement provisoire de la République française'', or GPRF, operated under a ''tripartisme'' alliance of communists, socialists, and democratic republicans. The GPRF governed France only from 1944 to 1946, when it was replaced by the [[French Fourth Republic]]. However, it had a lasting impact on late-war and post-war France. Key legislative actions included declaration of the Vichy laws and acts as unconstitutional and therefore illegal, re-establishment of republican legality throughout metropolitan France, election of replacement local governments that had been suppressed by the Vichy regime, voting for women, and implementation of labour laws. 

Germany surrendered effective 8 May 1945 with the [[German Instrument of Surrender]], ending the European theater of World War II. [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|General Leclerc]] later, along with the [[French battleship Richelieu|battleship ''Richelieu'']], represented France at Tokyo during the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japanese surrender]], ending World War II completely.

===Cold War===
{{see also|French Fourth Republic|French Fifth Republic}}
On 13 October 1946, a new constitution established the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. The Fourth Republic comprised under a parliamentary form of government controlled by a series of coalitions. 

During the next 16 years the French Colonial Empire would disintegrate. 
*Israel was established in 1948, and France was one of the fiercest supporters of the Jewish state, supplying it with extensive weaponry it used during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The French Republic needed an alliance with Israel to secure the [[Suez Canal]] from potential threats in a context of decolonisation.
{{Governments of France}}
*In Indochina the French government was facing the [[Viet Minh]] communist rebels and lost its Indochinese colonies during the [[First Indochina War]] in 1954 after the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. [[Vietnam]] was divided in two states while [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] were made independent. France left Indochina only to be replaced there by the United States, which would soon be engaged in the long [[Vietnam War]].
*In 1956 another crisis struck French colonies, this time in Egypt. The Suez Canal, having been built by the French government, belonged to the French Republic and was operated by the [[Suez Canal Company|Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]. Great Britain had bought the Egyptian share from [[Isma'il Pasha]] and was the second largest owner of the canal before the crisis. The Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the canal despite French and British opposition; he estimated a European answer was most unlikely to happen. Great Britain and France attacked Egypt and built an alliance with Israel against Nasser. Israel attacked from the east, Britain from Cyprus and France from Algeria. Egypt, the most powerful Arab state of the time, was defeated in a mere few days.
*The Suez crisis caused an outcry of indignation in the entire Arab world and Saudi Arabia set an embargo on oil on France and Britain. The US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] forced a ceasefire when he threatened to sell all American shares of British Pounds and to crash the British economy. The British forces were retired from the conflict and Israel, having seized interests in the Sinai region, withdrew soon leaving France alone in Egypt. Under stronger political pressures the French government ultimately evacuated its troops from Suez. This was a major political defeat for France and the American threats during the war were received with indignation by the French popular opinion. This led directly, and was used as a point, to the French withdrawal from the integrated military command of [[NATO]] in 1966. Another consequence of this was the French loss of geopolitical interests in the region; this meant an alliance with Israel was no longer of any use for French diplomacy.

General de Gaulle was elected president in 1958 and made the French [[Strike Force (France)|Force de Frappe]], the nuclear power, a priority of the French Defence. France then adopted the [[Mutual assured destruction|dissuasion du faible au fort doctrine]] which meant a Soviet attack on France would only bring total destruction to both sides. 

{{quote|&quot;Within ten years, we shall have the means to kill 80 million Russians. I truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80&amp;nbsp;million Russians, even if one can kill 800&amp;nbsp;million French, that is if there were 800&amp;nbsp;million French.&quot;}}

The May 1958 seizure of power in [[Algiers]] by French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection led to the fall of the French government and a presidential invitation to de Gaulle to form an emergency government to forestall the threat of civil war. The new constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]], introduced on 5 October 1958, gave greater powers to the presidency. [[Algeria]] became independent in 1962.

In [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 students revolted]], with a variety of demands including educational, labor and governmental reforms, sexual and artistic freedom, and the end of the Vietnam War. The student protest in unruly movements quickly joined with labor, and mass strikes erupted. De Gaulle responded by calling a [[French legislative election, 1968|legislative election for 23 June]], in which his [[Union of Democrats for the Republic|UDR party]] increased their vote, and the protests faded away during the summer.

===Post Cold War===
[[File:treaty nice.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing the [[Treaty of Nice]]]]
After the fall of the USSR and the end of the [[Cold War]] potential menaces to mainland France appeared considerably reduced. France began reducing its nuclear capacities and conscription was abolished in 2001. In 1990 France, led by [[François Mitterrand]], joined the short lived [[Gulf War]] against Iraq, the French participation to this war would be called the [[Opération Daguet]].

However, despite the end of the cold war and the fact future conflicts would be fought away from home, there were still menaces against mainland France in the form of terrorism. In 1994 [[Air France Flight 8969]] was hijacked by Islamic terrorists with the suspected intent to crash the plane over Paris. The hijacking was a failure for the terrorist group, known as the [[Armed Islamic Group|GIA]] after an intervention from the [[GIGN]] in Marseille, where the plane was grounded. More terrorist attacks would happen and these culminated into the [[1995 Paris Metro bombing]]. Important leaders of the GIA in France fell afterward: [[Khaled Kelkal]] was killed in Lyon by the [[EPIGN]] and [[Rachid Ramda]] was arrested in London although it took ten years for the French justice to have him extradited. 

[[Jacques Chirac]] assumed office as president on 17 May 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France's stubbornly high unemployment rate. While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union. In 1992 France ratified the [[Maastricht Treaty]] establishing the [[European Union]]. In 1999, the Euro was introduced to replace the French franc. Beyond membership in the [[European Union]], France is also involved in many joint European projects such as [[Airbus]], the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] and the [[Eurocorps]].

The French have stood among the strongest supporters of [[NATO]] and EU policy in the Balkans to prevent genocide in [[Yugoslavia]]. French troops joined the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. France has also been actively involved against international terrorism. In 2002 [[Alliance Base]], an international [[Counterterrorist Intelligence Center]], was secretly established in Paris. The same year France contributed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|toppling of the Taliban regime]] in Afghanistan, but it strongly rejected the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], even threatening to veto in central coners in the US proposed resolution. 

Jacques Chirac was reelected in 2002, mainly because his socialist rival [[Lionel Jospin]] was defeated by the extreme right wing candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. France was struck by a long period of [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest]] in 2005 after the death of two teenagers. At the end of his second term Jacques Chirac chose not to run again at the age of 74. 

The cabinet minister and rival [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected and took office on 16 May 2007. The problem of high unemployment has yet to be resolved. In 2008, France was one of the first states to recognise [[Kosovo]] as an independent nation.

In 2012 Sarkozy ran for re-election but was defeated by [[François Hollande]] who advocated a growth policy in contrast to the austerity policy advocated by Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] as a way of tackling the [[European sovereign debt crisis]].
