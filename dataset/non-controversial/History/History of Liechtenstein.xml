      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12509">Political identity came to the territory now occupied by the '''Principality of Liechtenstein''' in 814, with the formation of the subcountry of Lower [[Rhaetia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Liechtenstein-HISTORY.html |title=History - Liechtenstein - issues, growth, area, system, economic growth, power |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liechtenstein's borders have remained unchanged since 1434, when the [[Rhine]] established the border between the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cantons.

==Antiquity==
{{main|Switzerland in the Roman era}}
A [[Roman Empire|Roman]] road crossed the region from south to north, traversing the Alps by the [[Splügen Pass]] and following the right bank of the [[Rhine]] at the edge of the floodplain, for long uninhabited because of periodic flooding.  [[Roman Empire|Roman]] villas  have been excavated in [[Schaanwald]] and [[Nendeln]]. The late Roman influx of the [[Alemanni]] from the north is memorialized by the remains of a Roman fort at [[Schaan]].

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Schlossvaduz.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Vaduz Castle]], built during the Middle Ages]]
The area, part of [[Raetia]], was incorporated into the Carolingian empire, and divided into countships, which became subdivided over the generations. Because the [[duchy of Swabia]] lost its duke in 1268 and was never restored, all vassals of the duchy became immediate vassals of the Imperial Throne (as has happened in much of Westphalia when the duchy of Saxons was divided and partially dissolved in aftermath of the defeat of [[Henry the Lion]]).

The medieval county of [[Vaduz]] was formed in 1342 as a small subdivision of the Werdenberg county of the dynasty of [[Montfort of Vorarlberg]]. The 15th century brought three wars and some devastation.

The Principality takes its name from the Liechtenstein family, rather than vice-versa, and the family in turn takes its name from [[Castle Liechtenstein]] in [[Lower Austria]], which it owned from at least 1140 until the 13th century and from 1807 onwards. Over the centuries, the family acquired huge landed estates, mostly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]] and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], but all of these rich territories were held in fief under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the [[Habsburg]] family, to which many Liechtensteins were close advisors. Thus, without holding any land directly under the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet the primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet, the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]], although its head was elevated to princely rank in the late 17th century.

==Early modern era==
Liechtenstein was invaded by both [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops during the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618–1648.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt;  During the 17th century the country was afflicted by a plague and also by a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], in which more than 100 persons were persecuted and executed.

Prince [[Johann Adam Andreas of Liechtenstein]] bought the domain of [[Schellenberg]] in 1699 and the county of [[Vaduz]] in 1712. This Prince of Liechtenstein had wide landholdings in Austria, Bohemia and Moravia, but none of his lands were held directly from the Emperor. Thus, the prince was barred from entry to the Council of Princes and the prestige and influence that would entail.

By acquiring the Lordships of Schellenberg and Vaduz, modest areas of mountain villages each of which was directly subordinate to the Emperor because there was no duke of Swabia any longer, the Prince of Liechtenstein achieved his goal. The territory took the name of the family which now ruled it. On January 23, 1719, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that the counties of Vaduz and Schellenberg be promoted to a principality with the name Liechtenstein for his servant [[Anton Florian of Liechtenstein]] whereby they became ''Heiliger Römischer Reichsfürst''.

==Nineteenth century==
[[Image:Rheinbund 1812.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of the Confederation of the Rhine.]]
Liechtenstein became a sovereign state in 1806 when it joined Napoleon's [[Confederation of the Rhine]] upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.

The French under [[Napoleon]] occupied the country for a few years, but Liechtenstein retained its independence in 1815. Soon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the [[German Confederation]] (20 June 1815 – 24 August 1866, which was presided over by the [[Emperor of Austria]]).

Then, in 1818, [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann I]] granted a constitution, although it was limited in its nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raton|first=Pierre|title=Liechtenstein: History and Institutions of the Principality|location=Vaduz|publisher=[[Liechtenstein Verlag]]|year=1970|page=27|asin=B0006D0J8E}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1818 also saw the first visit of a member of the house of Liechtenstein, Prince Alois.  However, the first visit by a sovereign prince would not occur until 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Raton 1970, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, a [[1862 Constitution of Liechtenstein|new Constitution]] was promulgated,&lt;ref&gt;Raton 1970, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  which provided for a Diet representative of the people. In 1868, after the German Confederation dissolved, Liechtenstein disbanded its army of 80 men and declared its permanent [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], which was respected during both World Wars.

==Liechtenstein during the World Wars==
Liechtenstein did not participate in [[World War I]], claiming neutrality. However, until the end of the war, [[Liechtenstein]] was closely tied to [[Austria]]. In response, Allies imposed an economic embargo on the principality. The economic devastation forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with [[Switzerland]]. In 1919 [[Liechtenstein]] and Switzerland signed a treaty under which [[Switzerland]] assumes the representation of [[Liechtenstein]] interests at the diplomatic and consular level in countries where it maintains a representation and [[Liechtenstein]] does not.

In the spring of 1938, just after the annexation of Austria into [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], eighty-four year-old [[Franz I of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz I]] abdicated, naming his thirty-one year-old third cousin, [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Joseph II]], as his successor. While Prince Franz I claimed that old age was his reason for abdicating, it is believed that he had no desire to be on the throne if Germany gobbled up its new neighbor, Liechtenstein. His wife, whom he married in 1929, was a wealthy Jewish woman from [[Vienna]], and local Liechtenstein Nazis had already singled her out as their [[anti-Semitic]] &quot;problem&quot;. Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement had been simmering for years within its National Union party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759431,00.html |title=LIECHTENSTEIN: Nazi Pressure? |publisher=TIME |date=1938-04-11 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Franz Josef II became the first Prince of Liechtenstein to take up permanent residence in Liechtenstein.

During [[World War II]], Liechtenstein remained neutral, while family treasures within the war zone were brought to Liechtenstein (and [[London]]) for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], acting to seize what they considered to be German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's hereditary lands and possessions in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] — the princes of Liechtenstein lived in [[Vienna]] until the [[Anschluss]] of 1938. The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the [[World Court]]) included over 1,600 square kilometres (600&amp;nbsp;mi.²) of agricultural and forest land, also including several family castles and palaces. Citizens of Liechtenstein were also forbidden from entering Czechoslovakia during the [[Cold War]]. Liechtenstein gave asylum to approximately five hundred soldiers of the [[First Russian National Army]] (a collaborationist Russian force within the German [[Wehrmacht]]) at the close of World War II; this is commemorated by a [[Russian Monument Liechtenstein|monument]] at the border town of [[Hinterschellenberg]] which is marked on the country's [[tourist]] map. The act of granting asylum was no small matter as the country was poor and had difficulty feeding and caring for such a large group of refugees. Eventually, Argentina agreed to permanently resettle the asylum seekers. In contrast, [[Operation Keelhaul|the British repatriated the Russians who fought on the side of Germany to the USSR]], where they were summarily treated as traitors and most of them executed, including their families.

==The Post-War era==
In dire financial straits following the war, the Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including for instance the portrait &quot;[[Ginevra de' Benci]]&quot; by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Art]] of the [[United States]] in 1967. Liechtenstein prospered, however, during the decades following, as its economy modernized with the advantage of low corporate tax rates which drew many companies to the country. Liechtenstein became increasingly important as a financial center. In 1989, [[Prince Hans-Adam II]] succeeded his father to the throne, and in 1996, Russia returned the Liechtenstein family's archives, ending a long-running dispute between the two countries. In 1978, Liechtenstein became member of the [[Council of Europe]], and then joined the [[United Nations]] in 1990, the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1991, and both the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.

==Liechtenstein during the 21st century==
[[Image:Erbprinz Alois von und zu Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Prince Alois of Liechtenstein]]]]
In a referendum on March 16, 2003, Prince Hans-Adam, who had threatened to leave the country if he lost, won a large majority (64.3%) in favour of overhauling the constitution to effectively give him more powers than any other European monarch. The new constitution gave the prince the right to dismiss governments and approve judicial nominees and allowed him to veto laws simply by refusing to sign them within a six-month period.

On August 15, 2003, Hans-Adam announced he would step down in one year and hand over the reins to his son [[Prince Alois of Liechtenstein|Alois]].

On July 1, 2007, the Liechtenstein Ruling Prince, [[Hans-Adam II]], and Liechtenstein Prime Minister, [[Otmar Hasler]], appointed Dr. Bruce S. Allen and Mr. Leodis C. Matthews, both in the [[United States of America]], as the first two Honorary [[Consuls]] in history for the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/fl-aussenstelle-washington/fl-aussenstelle-aktuell?newsid=15219 ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
