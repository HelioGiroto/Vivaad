{{History of Andorra}}
'''[[Andorra]]''' is the last independent survivor of the [[Marca Hispanica]], the [[buffer state]]s created by [[Charlemagne]] to keep the [[Islam]]ic [[Moors]] from advancing into [[Christianity|Christian]] [[France]]. Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. In the 9th century, Charlemagne's grandson, [[Charles the Bald]], named the [[Counts of Urgell|Count of Urgell]] as overlord of Andorra. A descendant of the count later gave the lands to the [[Diocese of Urgell]], headed by [[Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]].

==Early history==
In the 11th century, fearing military action by neighboring lords, the bishop placed himself under the protection of the [[Lord of Caboet]], a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[nobility|nobleman]]. Later, the [[Counts of Foix|Count of Foix]] became heir to the Lord of Caboet through marriage, and a dispute arose between the French Count and the Catalan bishop over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|pareage]] (''pariatges''), which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the [[Bishop]] of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] (Catalonia, [[Spain]]). The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form.  In return, Andorra pays an annual tribute or ''questia'' to the co-rulers consisting of four [[ham]]s, forty loaves of [[bread]], and some [[wine]].  As of the year 2012, Andorra's borders have remained unchanged since 1278.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/61/pdfs/andorra-e.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62NCeD4x4 |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. Albert Pintat; President of the government of the principality of Andorra |publisher=61'st session of the United Nations General Assembly |date=September 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra was briefly annexed to the [[Crown of Aragon]] twice, in 1396 and 1512.

In 1505, [[Germaine of Foix]] married [[Ferdinand V of Castile]], thereby bringing the lordship of Andorra under Spanish rule. On taking over the kingdom in 1519, [[Emperor Charles V]] granted the lordship of [[Les Valls]], as it was then known, to Germaine of Foix’s line in perpetuity. [[Henry III of Navarre]], who was also count of Foix, in 1589 ascended the French throne as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and by an edict of 1607 established the head of the French state, along with the bishop of Urgel, as co-princes of Andorra.

In 1793, the French revolutionary government refused the traditional Andorran tribute as smacking of [[feudalism]] and renounced its suzerainty, despite the wish of the Andorrans to enjoy French protection and avoid being under exclusively Spanish influence.

Andorra remained neutral during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Napoleon restored the co-principality in 1806 after the Andorrans petitioned him to do so. French title to the principality subsequently passed from the kings to the president of France. In the period 1812–13, the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre (department)|Sègre]]).

==20th century==
In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12, 1934, an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco's Spain]].

During [[World War II]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route from Spain into France. The [[French Resistance]] used Andorra as part of their route to get downed airmen out of France. 

In 1943, Andorra carried out its first execution since the 19th century, that of [[Antoni Arenis]] for double fratricide by firing squad (because a trained executioner was unavailable to operate the legal method - [[Garrote]]).

In 1958, Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]], having been forgotten on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended [[World War I]] and, the conflict being [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]], remaining legally at war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C17FE3E54127B93C7AB1782D85F4C8585F9 World War I Ends in Andorra]&quot;, [[United Press International|UPI]] story in the ''New York Times'', 25 September 1958. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Long an impoverished land having little contact with any nations other than adjoining France and Spain, Andorra after World War II achieved considerable prosperity through a developing [[Tourism in Andorra|tourist industry]]. This development, abetted by improvements in transport and communications, has tended to break down Andorra’s isolation and to bring Andorrans into the mainstream of European history. Public demands for democratic reforms led to the extension of the franchise to women in the 1970s and to the creation of new and more fully autonomous organs of government in the early 1980s.

==Modern history==
Andorra formally became a parliamentary democracy in May 1993 following approval of a new [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] by a popular referendum in March 1993. The new constitution retained the French and Spanish co-princes although with reduced, and narrowly defined powers. Civil rights were greatly expanded including the legalization of political parties and trade unions, and provision was made for an independent judiciary. Andorra entered into a customs union with the [[European Communities]] (now the EU) in 1991 and was admitted to the UN on 28 July 1993. The country
has been seeking ways to improve its export potential and increase its economic ties with its European neighbors. The financial services sector of the economy is highly important, given Andorra’s status as a tax haven and its banking secrecy laws.
