{{History of Oman}}
This article is about the '''history of [[Oman]]'''.

==Prehistory==
{{Main|Archaeology of Oman|Magan|A'ad}}
[[File:World Heritage Grave Al Ayn Oman.JPG|thumb|left|World Heritage Grave at Al Ayn in Oman]]

Prehistoric migration of Homo sapiens is likely to have taken place around 100,000 years ago and to have followed the coastlines from Africa along Yemen and the sea shores of Oman. Archaeological sites in Yemen and Oman have yielded a stone tool style that is distinct from the East African tradition. That raises the possibility that humans were established on the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula beginning as far back as 100,000 years ago or more. The oldest Home sapiens, known as H. sapiens idaltu, was found to be 160,000 years old, found at the Middle Awash site in Ethiopia. Then between 80k-125 k years ago, modern humans began appearing in the middle east.
[[File:Journal.pone.0028239.g011 Dhofar Mountains Oman.png|right|thumb|Archaeologists excavating a Middle Stone Age complex in the Dhofar Mountains.]]

The Negrito represent the first migration of anatomically modern Homo sapiens out of Africa while the Arab with the Brown skin are Veddoids who are the descendants of the second wave of migration back from Persian side after the flood 7,000 years back.  The departure of mankind from Africa to colonise the rest of the world involved them crossing the Straits of Bab el Mandab in the southern Red Sea and moving along the green coastlines around Arabia and thence to the rest of Eurasia. That crossing  became possible when sea level had fallen by more than 80m to expose much of the shelf between southern Eritrea and Yemen; a level that was reached during a glacial stadial from 60 to 70 ka as climate cooled erratically to reach the last glacial maximum. From 135,000 to 90,000 years ago tropical Africa had [[megadrought]]s which drove the humans from the land towards the sea shores and forced them to cross over to other continents.The researchers used radiocarbon  dating techniques on pollen grains trapped in lake bottom mud to establish vegetation over the ages of the Malawi lake in Africa. The researchers took samples at 300-year-intervals. Samples from the megadrought times had little pollen or charcoal, suggesting sparse vegetation with little to burn. The area around Lake Malawi, which today is heavily forested was a desert  135,000 to 90,000 years ago.

There have been discoveries of Palaeolithic stone tools in caves in southern and central Oman, and in the United Arab Emirates close to the Straits of Hormuz at the outlet of the Persian Gulf (UAE site (Jebel Faya), Ref: Armitage, S.J. et al. 2011. Ref2: The southern route ‘out of Africa’: evidence for an early expansion of modern humans into Arabia. Science, v. 331, p.&amp;nbsp;453-456). The stone tools, some up to 125,000 years old, resemble those made by humans in Africa around the same period.
 
Luminescence dating is a technique that measures naturally occurring radiation stored in the sand. Luminescence dating data showed that 130,000 years ago, the Arabian Peninsula was relatively more warm which caused more rainfall, turning it into a series of lush habitable land. During this period the southern Red Sea’s levels dropped and was only 2.5 miles or 4&amp;nbsp;km wide. This offered a brief window of time for humans to easily cross the sea and cross the Peninsula to opposing sites like Jebel Faya. These early migrants running away from the climate change in Africa, crossed the Red Sea into Yemen and Oman, trekked across Arabia during favourable climate conditions. 2,000 kilometres of inhospitable desert lie between the Red Sea and Jebel Faya in UAE. But around 130,000 years ago the world was at the end of an ice age. The Red Sea was shallow enough to be crossed on foot or on a small raft, and the Arabian peninsula was being transformed from a parched desert into a green land.

==Antiquity==
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Sassanid Empire|Parthia}}
[[Achaemenid]] (6th to 4th century BC), an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] dynasty, controlled and/or influenced the Omani peninsula. This influential control was most likely exerted from a coastal center such as [[Sohar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East – Page 186 by Eric M. Meyers&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BC to the arrival of Islam in the 7th century, Oman was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties, the [[Parthians]] and the [[Sassanids]]. During this period Oman's administrative name was Mazun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; By about 250 BC, the Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the [[Parthians]] established garrisons in Oman. In the 3rd century AD, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] succeeded the Parthians and held area until the rise of Islam four centuries later. This agricultural and military contact gave people exposure to Persian culture, as reflected in certain irrigation techniques still used in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;Bahrain By Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Islamic period==
{{See also|Oman proper}}
[[File:Nizwa-Vestiges de la vieille ville (3).JPG|thumb|right|Vestiges in Nizwa]][[Oman]] adopted [[Islam]] in the 7th century, during the lifetime of the prophet [[Muhammad]]. [[Ibadi]]sm became the dominant religious sect in Oman by the 8th century; Oman is currently the only country in the Islamic world with a majority Ibadi population. [[Ibadhism]] is known for its &quot;moderate conservatism&quot;. One distinguishing feature of Ibadism is the choice of ruler by communal consensus and consent.

The relatively recent name of &quot;Muscat and Oman&quot; (which was abolished in 1970 in favor of &quot;Sultanate of Oman&quot;), implies two historically irreconcilable political cultures: the coastal tradition, the more cosmopolitan, secular, Muscat tradition of the coast ruled by the sultan; and the interior tradition of insularity, tribal in origin and ruled by an imam according to the ideological tenets of Ibadism. The more cosmopolitan has been the ascending political culture since the founding of the [[Al Said]] dynasty in 1744, although the imamate tradition has found intermittent expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/omtoc.html#om0052 A Country Study: Oman]'', chapter 6 Oman – Government and Politics, section: Historical Patterns of Governance. [[US Library of Congress]], 1993. Retrieved 2006-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Several millennia ago, Arab tribes migrated eastward to Oman, coinciding with the increasing presence in the region of peoples from present-day Iran. In the 6th century, Arabs succeeded in repelling encroachments of these ethnic groups; the conversion of Arab tribes to Islam in the 7th century resulted in the displacement of the settlers from Iran. The introduction of Ibadism vested power in the imam, the leader nominated by the ulema.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt; The imam's position was confirmed when the imam—having gained the allegiance of the tribal sheiks—received the bay'ah (oath of allegiance) from the public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 751 Ibadi Muslims, a moderate branch of the Kharijites, established an imamate in Oman. Despite interruptions, the Ibadi imamate survived until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561099_7/Oman.html#s28 Fourth line down from the top of the history section: &quot;In 751 Ibadi Muslims, a moderate branch of the Kharijites, established an imamate in Oman. Despite interruptions, the Ibadi imamate survived until the mid-20th century&quot;. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqlratp Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Oman was nonetheless conquered by several foreign powers, having been controlled by the [[Qarmatians]] between 931–932 and then again between 933–934. Between 967 and 1053, Oman was part of the domain of the Iranian [[Buyyids]], and between 1053 and 1154, Oman was part of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]].

In 1154, the indigenous Nabhani dynasty took control of Oman, and the Nabhani kings ruled Oman until 1470, with an interruption of 37 years between 1406 and 1443.

[[File:Jabrin-Wall (2).jpg|left|thumb|Wall of the Jabrin Castle]]
[[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] was taken by the Portuguese on 1 April 1515, and was held until 26 January 1650,  although the [[Ottomans]] controlled Muscat between 1550–1551 and 1581–1588. In about the year 1600, Nabhani rule was temporarily restored to Oman, although that lasted only to 1624, when fifth imamate, which is also known as the [[Yarubid]] Imamate. The latter recaptured Muscat from the Portuguese in 1650 after a colonial presence on the northeastern coast of Oman dating to 1508. The Yarubid dynasty expanded, acquiring former Portuguese colonies in East Africa and engaging in the slave trade. By 1719 dynastic succession led to the nomination of Saif ibn Sultan II. His candidacy prompted a rivalry among the ulama and a civil war between the two major tribes, the Hinawi and the Ghafiri, with the Ghafiri supporting Saif ibn Sultan II. He assumed power in 1748 after the leaders of both factions had been killed in battle, but the rivalry continued, with the factionalization working in favor of the Iranians, who occupied Muscat and Sohar in 1743.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt;

The Iranians had occupied the coast before—indeed the coast was often the possession of various empires. These empires brought order to the religious and ethnic diversity of the population of this cosmopolitan region. Yet the intervention on behalf of an unpopular dynasty brought about a revolt. The leader of the revolt, Ahmad ibn Said al Said, was elected sultan of Muscat upon the expulsion of the Persians. The position of Sultan of Muscat would remain in the possession of the Al Said clan even when the imamate of Oman remained out of reach.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The Al Said clan became a royal dynasty when Ahmad ibn Said Al Said was elected imam following the expulsion of the Iranians from Muscat in 1744. Like its predecessors, Al Said dynastic rule has been characterized by a history of internecine family struggle, fratricide, and usurpation. Apart from threats within the ruling family, there was the omnipresent challenge from the independent tribes of the interior who rejected the authority of the sultan, recognizing the imam as the sole legitimate leader and pressing, by resort to arms, for the restoration of the imamate.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Empire of Oman.svg|thumb|The Empire of Oman around the middle of the 19th century]]
Schisms within the ruling family were apparent before Ahmad ibn Said's death in 1783 and were later manifest with the division of the family into two main lines, the Sultan ibn Ahmad Al Said (r. 1792–1806) line controlling the maritime state, with nominal control over the entire country; and the Qais branch, with authority over the Al Batinah and Ar Rustaq areas. During the period of Sultan Said ibn Sultan Al Said's rule (1806–1856), Oman cultivated its East African colonies, profiting from the slave trade. As a regional commercial power in the 19th century, Oman held territories on the island of Zanzibar off the coast of [[East Africa]], the area along the coast of East Africa known as [[Zanj]] including [[Mombasa]] and [[Dar es Salaam]], and until 1958 in [[Gwadar]] (in present-day [[Pakistan]]) on the coast of the Arabian Sea. But when the British declared slavery illegal in the mid-19th century, the sultanate's fortunes reversed. The economy collapsed, and many Omani families migrated to Zanzibar. The population of Muscat fell from 55,000 to 8,000 between the 1850s and 1870s.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt; Most of the overseas possessions were seized by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and by 1850 Oman was an isolated and poor area of the world.

==Late 19th and early 20th centuries==
{{Main|Muscat and Oman}}
When Sultan [[Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid]] died in 1856, his sons quarreled over the succession. As a result of this struggle, the empire—through the mediation of the British Government under the Canning Award—was divided in 1861 into two separate principalities: [[Zanzibar]] (with its East African dependencies), and [[Muscat and Oman]].

The death of Sa'id bin Sultan in 1856 prompted a further division: the descendants of the late sultan ruled Muscat and Oman ([[Thuwaini bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Thuwaini ibn Said Al-Busaid]], r. 1856–1866) and Zanzibar ([[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Mayid ibn Said Al-Busaid]], r. 1856–1870); the Qais branch intermittently allied itself with the ulama to restore imamate legitimacy. In 1868 Azzam ibn Qais Al-Busaid (r. 1868–1871) emerged as self-declared imam. Although a significant number of Hinawi tribes recognized him as imam, the public neither elected him nor acclaimed him as such.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt;

Imam Azzan understood that to unify the country a strong, central authority had to be established with control over the interior tribes of Oman. His rule was jeopardized by the British, who interpreted his policy of bringing the interior tribes under the central government as a move against their established order. In resorting to military means to unify Muscat and Oman, Imam Azzam alienated members of the Ghafiri tribes, who revolted in the 1870–1871 period. The British gave Imam Azzam's rival, Turki ibn Said Al-Busaid, financial and political support. Turki ibn Said succeeded in defeating the forces of Imam Azzam, who was killed in battle outside Matrah in January 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC HistGovernance&quot;/&gt;

Muscat and Oman was the object of [[France|Franco]]-[[British Empire|British]] rivalry throughout the 18th century. During the 19th century, Muscat and Oman and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties of friendship and [[commerce]]. In 1908 the British entered into an agreement of friendship. Their traditional association was confirmed in 1951 through a new treaty of friendship, commerce, and [[navigation]] by which the United Kingdom recognized the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman as a fully independent state.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were tensions between the sultan in Muscat and the Ibadi Imam in Nizwa. This conflict was resolved temporarily by the [[Treaty of Seeb]], which granted the imam rule in the interior [[Imamate of Oman]], while recognising the sovereignty of the sultan in Muscat and its surroundings.

In 1954, the [[Jebel Akhdar War|conflict]] flared up again, when the Treaty of Seeb was broken by the sultan after oil was discovered in the lands of the Imam. The new imam ([[Ghalib bin Ali]]) led a 5-year [[Jebel Akhdar War|rebellion]] against the sultan's attack. The Sultan was aided by the colonial British forces and the Shah of Iran. In the early 1960s, the Imam, exiled to [[Saudi Arabia]], obtained support from his hosts and other [[Arab]] governments, but this support ended in the 1980s. The case of the Imam was argued at the United Nations as well, but no significant measures were taken. 

Zanzibar paid an annual subsidy to Muscat and Oman until its independence in early 1964.

In 1964, a separatist revolt began in [[Dhofar]] province. Aided by [[Communist]] and [[Left-wing politics|leftist governments]] such as the former [[South Yemen]] ([[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]]), the rebels formed the [[Dhofar Liberation Front]], which later merged with the [[Marxist]]-dominated [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arab Gulf]] (PFLOAG). The PFLOAG's declared intention was to overthrow all traditional [[Persian Gulf]] régimes. In mid-1974, the Bahrain branch of the PFLOAG was established as a separate organisation and the Omani branch changed its name to the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman]] (PFLO), while continuing the [[Dhofar Rebellion]].

==1970s==
In 1970, [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]] ousted his father, [[Said Bin Taimur of Muscat|Sa'id bin Taymur]], who later died in exile in [[London]]. Al Said has ruled as sultan ever since.  The new sultan confronted insurgency in a country plagued by endemic disease, [[illiteracy]], and [[poverty]]. One of the new sultan's first measures was to abolish many of his father's harsh restrictions, which had caused thousands of Omanis to leave the country, and to offer amnesty to opponents of the previous régime, many of whom returned to Oman. He also established a modern government structure and launched a major development programme to upgrade educational and [[health]] facilities, build a modern infrastructure, and develop the country's [[natural resource]]s.

In an effort to curb the Dhofar insurgency, Sultan Qaboos expanded and re-equipped the armed forces and granted amnesty to all surrendering rebels while vigorously prosecuting the war in Dhofar. He obtained direct military support from the UK, [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]], and [[Jordan]]. By early 1975, the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s were confined to a {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|adj=on|sp=us}} area near the [[Yemen]]i border and shortly thereafter were defeated. As the war drew to a close, civil action programs were given priority throughout Dhofar and helped win the allegiance of the people. The PFLO threat diminished further with the establishment of diplomatic relations in October 1983 between South Yemen and Oman, and South Yemen subsequently lessened propaganda and subversive activities against Oman. In late 1987 Oman opened an embassy in [[Aden]], South Yemen, and appointed its first resident ambassador to the country.

Since his accession in 1970, Sultan Qaboos has balanced tribal, regional, and ethnic interests in composing the national [[administration (government)|administration]]. The Council of Ministers, which functions as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], consists of 26 [[Minister (government)|ministers]], all directly appointed by Qaboos. The ''[[Majlis Al-Shura]]'' (Consultative Council) has the mandate of reviewing [[legislation]] pertaining to [[economic development]] and social services prior to its becoming law. The ''Majlis Al-Shura'' may request ministers to appear before it.

==1990s==
In November 1996, Sultan Qaboos presented his people with the &quot;[[Basic Statutes of the State]]&quot;, Oman's first written &quot;[[constitution]]&quot;. It guarantees various rights within the framework of [[Qur'an]]ic and customary law. It partially resuscitated long dormant conflict-of-interest measures by banning cabinet ministers from being officers of public shareholding firms. Perhaps most importantly, the Basic Statutes provide rules for setting Sultan Qaboos' succession.

Oman occupies a strategic location on the [[Strait of Hormuz]] at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, {{convert|35|mi|km}} directly opposite Iran. Oman has concerns with regional stability and security, given tensions in the region, the proximity of Iran and [[Iraq]], and the potential threat of political Islam. Oman maintained its diplomatic relations with Iraq throughout the [[Gulf War]] while supporting the [[United Nations]] [[allies]] by sending a contingent of troops to join coalition forces and by opening up to pre-positioning of weapons and supplies.

==2000s==
In September 2000, about 100,000 Omani men and women elected 83 candidates, including two women, to seats in the ''Majlis Al-Shura''. In December 2000, Sultan Qaboos appointed the 48-member ''[[Majlis Al Dowla]]'', or State Council, including five women, which acts as the upper [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]] in Oman's bicameral representative body.

Al Said's extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world and has preserved a long-standing political and military relationship with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and others. Oman's moderate, independent [[foreign policy]] has sought to maintain good relations with all [[Middle East]]ern countries.
