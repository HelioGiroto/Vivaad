'''West Germany''' ({{lang-de|Westdeutschland}}) is the common [[English language|English]] name for the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' or '''FRG''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland or BRD}}) in the period between its creation in May 1949 to [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990.  

During this period, the [[NATO]]-aligned West Germany and the socialist [[East Germany]] were divided by the [[Inner German border]]. After 1961, [[West Berlin]] was physically separated from [[East Berlin]] as well as from East Germany by the [[Berlin Wall]]. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of [[Berlin]]. The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states (known simply as &quot;Germany&quot;) is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany.

The Federal Republic of Germany was established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three [[Allied occupation of Germany|Allied Zones of occupation]] held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] (the &quot;Western Zones&quot;). The city of [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]] was its provisional capital city. The fourth Allied occupation zone (the East Zone, or ''Ostzone'') was held by the [[Soviet Union]]. The parts of this zone lying east of the [[Oder]]-[[Neisse]] were in fact annexed by the Soviet Union and communist Poland; the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (abbreviated GDR; in German ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' or ''DDR'') with its ''de facto'' capital in [[East Berlin]]. As a result, West Germany had a territory about half the size of the interwar democratic [[Weimar Republic]].

At the onset of the [[Cold War]], Germany (and, indeed, Europe) was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was ''[[de facto]]'' divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and divided Berlin. The Federal Republic of Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted state. The GDR did hold regular elections, but these were not free and fair; from the West German perspective the GDR was thus a puppet state of the Soviets and therefore illegitimate. 

Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered an unofficial ''de facto'' 11th state.  While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin aligned itself politically with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

Relations with the [[Soviet bloc]] improved during the era of ‘Neue [[Ostpolitik]]’ around 1970, and West Germany began taking the line of &quot;two German states within one German nation&quot;, but formally maintained the exclusive mandate. It recognised the GDR as a ''[[de facto]]'' government within a single German nation that in turn was represented ''[[de jure]]'' by the West German state alone. East Germany, as before, recognised the existence of two German countries ''de jure'', and the West as both ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' foreign country. The Federal Republic and the GDR agreed that neither of them could speak in the name of the other one.

The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in [[NATO]] but was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[G8|G6/G8]] was established in 1975, there was no question whether the Federal Republic of Germany would be a member as well.

With the [[collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990. Its five post-war states (''Länder'') were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional ''Land''. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|BRD (Germany)}}
The official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (Federal Republic of Germany). Its abbreviation &quot;BRD&quot; (German) or &quot;FRG&quot; (English) was sometimes also used.

In East Germany usage the terms ''Westdeutschland'' (West[ern] Germany) or ''westdeutsche Bundesrepublik'' (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed especially once East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|second constitution]] in 1968 abandoning the idea of a single German nation formerly upheld in East and West Germany alike. Starting in East German [[Neues Deutschland]] the initialism ''BRD'' (FRG) for the ''Federal Republic of Germany'' prevailed beginning in the early 1970s, while East German official sources adopted that initialism as the standard expression in 1973, followed by the usage of respective native abbreviations in all of the [[Eastern Bloc]].  

In reaction to this move, in 1965 the [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974 the heads of German federal and state governments recommended to always use the full name in official publications. From then on West German sources began to avoid the abbreviated form, except left-leaning sources who started to embrace it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.&lt;ref&gt;See in general: Stefan Schmidt, &quot;Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»&quot;, in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009) [https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany. 

Meanwhile the colloquial term &quot;West Germany&quot; or its equivalents were used in many other languages. &quot;Westdeutschland&quot; was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.

{{Main|History of Germany since 1945}}

February 4–11, 1945, leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements with post-war Europe and actions to be made against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated. The conference came to the agreement to split Germany into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]—the [[France|French]] Zone in the far west, the [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest, the [[United States|American]] Zone in the south, and the [[USSR|Soviet]] Zone in the east. It then was not the intention to split Germany, only to designate zones of administration.

Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] were put under Polish administration, and millions of Germans were expelled from there, to be replaced by Poles. (With the [[Soviet Union]] likewise taking a big bite from eastern Poland and [[East Prussia]]) In 1946–1949, the first three zones were combined in steps. First the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]], then only months afterward the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. At the same time, new federal states (''Länder'') were formed in the Allied zones, replacing the pre-war states. 

In 1949, with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–49), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], eventually became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's ''Länder'', the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].

===NATO membership===
&lt;!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]], and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]--&gt;
[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow), after accession of the Saarland in 1957, before the five ''Länder'' from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]
The Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot; on 5 May 1955. The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground, now as part of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, promising to rearm itself soon.

West Germany became a focus of the [[Cold War]] with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded [[Warsaw Pact]]. The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948–1949, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F002449-0027, Bonn, Bundestag, Pariser Verträge, Adenauer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]] in parliament, 1955]]
The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.

Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Other means then had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the [[Bundeswehr]]. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in case of an external attack against Germany or its allies (''Bündnisfall''). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.

The three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)

===The Sixties: a time for reforms===
The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged—almost literally—out of office in 1963. In 1959, it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would place Erhard in this office.  Erhard was not enthusiastic, and to everybody's surprise, Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position. His aim was apparently to remain in control of German politics for another ten years ins spite of the growing mood for change, but when his advisers informed him just how limited the powers of the president were he quickly lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;Informationen für Politisch Bildung Heft 258, 1998 S. 3&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture, Heinrich Lübke took on the task and was duly elected.  

In October 1962, the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published an analysis of the West German military defence.  the conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system.  Ten days after publication, the offices of Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized.  Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted.  The editor/owner of the magazine, Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer's own reputation was impaired and he announced that he would step down in the Fall of 1963.  His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.&lt;ref&gt;Informationen zur Politische Bildung 258, S 5&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early sixties, the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly.  In 1962, growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate petered into a recession, with no growth in 1967.  
In order to deal with this problem,a new coalition was formed. Kiesinger's 1966&amp;ndash;69 [[grand coalition]] was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]—the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.

[[File:Rudi.jpg|right|120px|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]
During the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself ''Notstand der Demokratie'' (Democracy in Crisis) and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament. 
A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the Shah of Persia visited West Berlin.  Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance.  Supporters of the Shah (later known as 'Jubelperser'), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forceably dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plain clothed policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the east German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin.  One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called Rudi Dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him.  All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students.  Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.&lt;ref&gt;Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the wake of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people.  One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz concentration camp and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the Shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.)  The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.

The calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate.  The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979,the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights.  Until 1979, a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.  Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely-accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic.  
[[File:RAF-Logo.svg|left|100px]]
Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters.  In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the 'struggle against imperialism.' &lt;ref&gt;Kraushaar op.cit&lt;/ref&gt;  The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form—the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example form activities in Italy of the Brigade Rosse, many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success.  The most notorious of the underground groups was the 'Baader-Meinhof Group', later known as the RAF which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name &quot;RAF&quot;. The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998.  Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Developments 1969-1990===
In the 1969 election, the SPD—headed by [[Willy Brandt]]—gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of he Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality.  Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries. (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.) &lt;ref&gt;Informationen zur Politische Bildung Heft 258, S. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Unions control over Eastern Europe.  Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after [[Günter Guillaume]], a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the [[Stasi]]. Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971. 

Finance Minister [[Helmut Schmidt]] (SPD) formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Max Otte and Jürgen Greve - 2000 -A rising middle power?: German foreign policy in transformation, 1989-1999'' (2000) p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1982, the SPD-FDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[Constructive Vote of No Confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.

===Reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}
The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the [[Bundestag]] concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].

==West German economic miracle==
The West German [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (English: &quot;economic miracle&quot;, coined by ''[[The Times]]'' of London in 1950), was partly due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]], but mainly due to the currency reform of 1948, which replaced the [[Reichsmark]] with the [[Deutsche Mark]] as legal tender, halting rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, Käfer.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Beetle]] – for many years the most successful car in the world – on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]
In addition to the physical obstacles that had to be overcome for the German economic recovery (see the [[Morgenthau Plan]]) there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual privileges of huge value, such as all German [[patent]]s, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html David R. Henderson, &quot;German Economic 'Miracle'&quot;, ''The Library of Economics and Liberty'' website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Susan Stern, &quot;Marshall Plan 1947–1997: A German View&quot;, ''Germany Info'' website].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile some of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the U.S.

Contrary to popular belief, the Marshall Plan, which was extended to include the newly formed West Germany in 1949, was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html Henderson, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Stern, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Had that been the case, other countries such as the United Kingdom and France (which both received higher economic assistance from the plan than Germany) should have experienced the same phenomenon. In fact, the amount of monetary aid (which was in the form of loans) received by Germany through the Marshall Plan was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies exacted from the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation (about [[United States dollar|$]]2.4 billion per year). In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.

The [[Korean war]] (1950–1953) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, and the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the [[deportation]]s and [[Human migration|migration]]s, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (&quot;guest workers&quot;) provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ga1ab-mhef&amp;sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources.

In 1952 West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]]. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot;. The [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[Military of France|French]] and [[Military of the United States|U.S. militaries]] remained in the country, just as the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] remained in East Germany. Four days after becoming &quot;fully sovereign&quot; in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The U.S. retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6). In 1973, West Germany—home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population—featured the world's [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP)|fourth largest GDP]] of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.

==Position towards East Germany==
{{See also|German reunification}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]] 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]
The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany was that the West German government was the only democratically elected and therefore the only legitimate representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany. 

In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of &quot;Neue [[Ostpolitik]]&quot; led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was abolished.

The West German Constitution (''Grundgesetz''/&quot;Basic Law&quot;) provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:
* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).
* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the first freely elected East German parliament decided in June 1990 that the ''Länder'' soon to be reestablished would join the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the (West) German Basic Law (''Grundgesetz''). This made a quick unification possible. In July/August 1990 the East German parliament enacted a law for the reestablishment of ''[[New federal states|Länder]]'' on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

The two German states entered into a [[Monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the then reestablished [[New federal states|five East German ''Länder'']] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.

==Politics==
Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949–63) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other rightwing parties.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, [[Villa Hammerschmidt]]]]

Kiesinger's 1966–69 &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts—the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].

Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself [[Notstand der Demokratie]] (&quot;Democracy in a State of Emergency&quot;) and the [[Trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, launched a vast campaign against the protesters and in 1968, believed by some as a result, there was an attempted assassination of one of the top members of the German socialist students' union, [[Rudi Dutschke]].

By 1958 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1960s [[environmentalism]] and [[anti-nationalism]] became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.

Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the [[Stasi]]. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] on 21 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schöllgen: ''Willy Brandt. Die Biographie.'' Propyläen, Berlin 2001. ISBN 3-549-07142-6&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the economic fallout of the [[1973 oil crisis]], almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt himself later said, &quot;I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Gregor Schöllgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] In: DIE ZEIT 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD-FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;.

The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On October 1, 1982, the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[Constructive vote of no confidence|Constructive Vote of No Confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.

==Culture==
===Culture in general===
In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.

===Sport===

[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating football's [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] in West Germany]]
In the 20th century [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2–1 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996. 

After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.

As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called &quot;West German&quot; before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.

===Literary scene===
Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representants of the [[Trümmerliteratur]]. [[Heinrich Böll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.

===Life in general===
[[File:Franz Skarbina Weihnachtsmarkt Berlin.jpg|thumb|Franz Skarbina: Weihnachtsmarkt in Berlin, 1892]]
During the 40 years of separation some divergence occurred in the cultural life of the two parts of the severed nation. Both West Germany and East Germany followed along traditional paths of the common German culture, but West Germany, being obviously more affected by influences from western Europe and [[North America]], became more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]]. Conversely, East Germany, while remaining more conservative than West Germany in its adherence to some aspects of the received tradition, was strongly moulded by the dictates of a [[state socialism|state socialist]] ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration. On the non-political level, East Germany was also influenced by the Eastern Bloc's Slavic cultures that manifested in art, culinary scene, and sports. Nevertheless, young East Germans were also fascinated by Western and particularly American culture, which they had a degree of access to in a variety of ways, not least through West German television and radio, whose broadcasts reached many parts of the country.

For the majority of Germans in present-day Germany who lived in pre-reunification West Germany, there has been minimal change in daily life stemming from German reunification as the reunified country is essentially West Germany incorporating East Germany on a West German base. In contrast, for East Germans the scale of change has been sweeping in all aspects of life from that before ''[[die Wende]]''. Although movements like [[Ostalgia]] exist attempting to celebrate and preserve parts of the GDR culture, since reunification the former East Germany has been converging towards the western part of the country in most parts of daily life.

==Geographical distribution of government==
In West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].

The West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[Unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (''Bezirke''), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states (''Länder'') with independently elected state parliaments and control of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.

==Present geographical and political terminology==
Today, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the ''Alte Bundesländer'' (old states) and the ''Neue Bundesländer'' (new states), although ''Westdeutschland'' and ''Ostdeutschland'' are still heard as well.
