{{History of Croatia}}

[[Croatia]] first appeared as a [[duchy]] in the 7th century and then as a kingdom in the 10th century. From the 12th century it remained a distinct state with its ruler (''[[ban (title)|ban]]'') and [[Croatian Parliament|parliament]], but it obeyed the kings and emperors of various neighboring powers, primarily [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Habsburg|Austria]]. The period from the 15th to the 17th centuries was marked by bitter struggles with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After being incorporated in [[Yugoslavia]] for most of the 20th century, Croatia regained independence in 1991.

== Prehistoric Croatia ==
{{see also|Prehistoric Croatia|Theories on the origin of Croats|White Croatia}}
The area known today as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the [[prehistoric period]]. Fossils of [[Neanderthals]] dating to the middle [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] period have been unearthed in  northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in [[Krapina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Acta Medico-Historica Adriatica|publisher=Hrvatsko znanstveno društvo za povijest zdravstvene kulture|issn=1334-4366|year=2010|month=December|volume=8|issue=2|author=Igor Salopek|title=Krapina Neanderthal Museum as a Well of Medical Information|pages=197–202|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=95232|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of several [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] cultures were found in all regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Opvscvla Archaeologica Radovi Arheološkog zavoda|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]], Faculty of Philosophy, Archaeological Department|issn=0473-0992|title=Study of the Neolithic and Eneolithic as reflected in articles published over the 50 years of the journal Opuscula archaeologica|pages=93–122|volume=30|issue=1|year=2008|month=April|author=Tihomila Težak-Gregl|accessdate=15 October 2011|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=34026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest proportion of the sites is in the northern Croatia river valleys, and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]], [[Vučedol culture|Vučedol]] and [[Baden culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Opvscvla Archaeologica Radovi Arheološkog zavoda|publisher=University of Zagreb, Faculty of Philosophy, Archaeological Department|issn=0473-0992|title=The Kostolac horizon at Vučedol|pages=25–40|volume=29|issue=1|year=2005|month=December| author=Jacqueline Balen|accessdate=15 October 2011|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=26644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Opvscvla Archaeologica Radovi Arheološkog zavoda|publisher=University of Zagreb, Faculty of Philosophy, Archaeological Department|issn=0473-0992|title=Prilog poznavanju neolitičkih obrednih predmeta u neolitiku sjeverne Hrvatske|trans_title=A Contribution to Understanding Neolithic Ritual Objects in the Northern Croatia Neolithic|language= Croatian|pages=43–48|volume=27|issue=1|year=2003|month= December|author=Tihomila Težak-Gregl|accessdate=15 October 2011|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=26644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iron Age]] left traces of the early [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] [[Hallstatt culture]] and the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[La Tène culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Prilozi Instituta za arheologiju u Zagrebu|publisher=Institut za arheologiju|issn=1330-0644|volume=19|issue=1|year=2002|month=July|trans_title=A Contribution to Understanding Continuous Habitation of Vinkovci and its Surroundings in the Early Iron Age|title= Prilog poznavanju naseljenosti Vinkovaca i okolice u starijem željeznom dobu|language=Croatian|pages=79–100|author1=Hrvoje Potrebica|author2=Marko Dizdar|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=1560|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, the region was settled by [[Liburnians]] and [[Illyrians]], while the first [[Greece|Greek]] colonies were established on the [[Vis (island)|Vis]] and [[Hvar]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illyrians.html?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C|author=John Wilkes|title=The Illyrians|year=1995|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-631-19807-9|page=114|quote=... in the early history of the colony settled in 385&amp;nbsp;BC on the island Pharos (Hvar) from the Aegean island Paros, famed for its marble.

== Roman provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia ==
[[File:SPLIT-Hebrard overall color restitution.jpg|thumb|right|Palace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, around which the Croatian city of [[Split (city)|Split]] emerged.]]
Dalmatia was the northern part&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland, ''BlackEncyclopaedia Biblica: A Critical Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Illyria]]n kingdom between the 4th century BC until the [[Illyrian Wars]] in the 220s BC and 168 BC when the [[Roman Republic]] established its protectorate south of the river [[Neretva]]. Area north of the Neretva was slowly incorporated into Roman possessions until the [[province of Illyricum]] was formally established c. 32-27 BC.

Dalmatia region then became part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Between 6 and 9 [[AD]] the Dalmatians raised the last in a series of revolts together with the [[Pannonians]], but it was finally crushed and in 10 [[AD]] Illyricum was split into two provinces, [[Pannonia]] and Dalmatia. The [[province of Dalmatia]] spread inland to cover all of the [[Dinaric Alps]] and most of the eastern Adriatic coast. Dalmatia was the birthplace of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]], who, upon retirement from Emperor  in AD 305, built  a [[Diocletian's Palace|large palace]] near [[Salona]], out of which the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] later developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 C.Michael Hogan, &quot;Diocletian's Palace&quot;, The Megalithic Portal, Andy Burnham ed., Oct 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Edward Gibbon]]|author2=[[John Bagnell Bury]]|author3=[[Daniel J. Boorstin]]|title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|publisher=[[Modern Library]]|year=1995|location=New York|page=335|isbn=978-0-679-60148-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bdKLyie1M50C|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as [[Theodore Mommsen]] and [[Bernard Bavant]] aruge that all Dalmatia was fully romanized and [[Latin]] speaking by the 4th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Others, such as [[Aleksandar Stipčević]], aruge that that the process of [[romanization]] was rather selective and involved mostly urban centers but not the countryside, where previous Illyrian socio-political structures weere adapted to Roman administration and political structure only in some necessities.&lt;ref&gt;A. Stipčević,'' Iliri'', Školska knjiga Zagreb, 1974, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed in 476, with the beginning of the [[Migration Period]], [[Julius Nepos]] shortly ruled his diminished domain from the Diocletian palace after his 476 flight from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xw4fAAAAMAAJ|author=[[J.

The region was then ruled by the [[Ostrogoths]] up to 535, when [[Justinian I]] added the territory to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Later, the Byzantines formed the [[Theme of Dalmatia]] in the same territory.

The Roman period ends with [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] and [[Croats|Croat]] invasions in the VI-VII century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatia-in-english.com/images/maps/3-5cen.jpg Map of Roman Dalmatia area, with added actual croatian names]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] was founded by such survivors from [[Epidaurum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPatton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E_NBAAAAYAAJ|title=Researches on the Danube and the Adriatic|author=Andrew Archibald Paton|year=1861|pages=218–219|publisher=Trübner|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Principality of Pannonian Croatia|Principality of Dalmatian Croatia}}
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Dolazak Hrvata na Jadran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oton Iveković]], ''The Croats arrival at the Adriatic Sea'']]
According to the work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th&amp;nbsp;century, however that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mužić-249-293&quot;&gt;Mužić (2007), pp. 249–293&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually two [[dukedom (administrative division)|dukedoms]] were formed—[[Pannonian Croatia|Duchy of Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia|Duchy of Dalmatia]], ruled by [[Ljudevit Posavski]] and [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], as attested by chronicles of [[Einhard]] starting in the year 818.

[[Tomislav I of Croatia|Tomislav]] was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the [[Pope John X]], dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and [[Croatian–Bulgarian battle of 927|Bulgarian invasions]], spreading the influence of Croatian kings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Posavec&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za hrvatsku povijest|volume=30|issue=1|issn=0353-295X|pages=281–290|title=Povijesni zemljovidi i granice Hrvatske u Tomislavovo doba|trans_title= Historical maps and borders of Croatia in age of Tomislav|language=Croatian|author=Vladimir Posavec|year=1998|month=March|accessdate=16 October 2011|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=62779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of [[Petar Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058–1074) and [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Dmitar Zvonimir]] (1075–1089).&lt;ref name=&quot;Margetić&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za hrvatsku povijest|volume=29|issue=1|issn=0353-295X|pages=11–20|title=Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae u doba Stjepana II.|trans_title=Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae in age of Stjepan II|language=Croatian|author=Lujo Margetić|year=1997|month=January|accessdate=16 October 2011|url= http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=76963}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Stephen II of Croatia|Stjepan II]] died in 1091 ending the [[House of Trpimirović|Trpimirović]] dynasty, [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] claimed Croatian crown.

The consequences of the change to the Hungarian king included the introduction of [[feudalism]] and the rise of the native noble families such as [[Frankopan]] and [[Šubić]].  The later kings sought to restore some of their previously lost influence by giving certain privileges to the towns. For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the [[Sabor]] (parliament) and a [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] (viceroy) appointed by the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povijest-saborovanja&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404|title=Povijest saborovanja|trans_title=History of parliamentarism|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Sabor]]|accessdate=18 October 2010|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qkc8832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The princes of Bribir from the Šubić family became particularly influential, asserting control over large parts of Dalmatia, [[Slavonia]] and Bosnia. Later, however, the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] intervened and restored royal power. The period saw rise of native nobility such as the [[Frankopan]]s and the [[Šubić]]s to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Font&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Povijesni prilozi|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=13778|issn=0351-9767|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|year=2005|month=July|volume=28|issue=28|pages=7–22|author=Márta Font|title=Ugarsko Kraljevstvo i Hrvatska u srednjem vijeku|language=Croatian|trans_title=Hungarian Kingdom and Croatia in the Middlea Ages|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate coronation as King of Croatia was gradually allowed to fall into abeyance and last crowned king is Charles Robert in 1301 after which Croatia contented herself with a separate diploma
inaugurale. The reign of [[Louis the Great]] (1342–1382) is considered the golden age of Croatian medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Zrinka Pešorda Vardić: The crown, the king and the town – the relation of Dubrovnik community toward the crown and the ruler in the beginning of movement against the Court (Croatian Institute of History)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus of Naples]] also sold the whole of Dalmatia to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in 1409. The period saw increasing threat of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest and struggle against the [[Republic of Venice]] for control of coastal areas. The Venetians gained control over most of Dalmatia by 1428, with exception of the [[Republic of Ragusa|city-state of Dubrovnik]] which became independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;frucht422&quot;&gt;Frucht 2005, p. 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490 the estates of Croatia declined to recognize [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] until he had taken oath to respect their liberties, and insisted upon his erasing from the diploma certain phrases which seemed to reduce Croatia to the rank of a mere province. The dispute was solved in 1492&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt |title=R. W.

==Croatia in Habsburg Monarchy (1527–1918)==
[[File:Ivan Zasche, Portret bana Josipa Jelacica.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Ban Josip Jelačić.]]
As the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] incursion into Europe started, Croatia once again became a border area.  The Croats fought an increasing number of battles and gradually lost increasing swaths of territory to the Ottoman Empire. [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquests]] led to the 1493 [[Battle of Krbava field]] and 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]], both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] died at Mohács, and in 1527, and the Hungarian parliament elected [[John Zápolya|János Szapolyai]] as the new king of Hungary. Another Hungarian parliament elected Ferdinand Habsburg as King of Hungary. On the other side, the [[Parliament on Cetin]] chose [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg]] as new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povijest-saborovanja&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frucht422&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;/&gt; A few years later both crown would be again united in Habsburgs hands and the union would be restored. The Ottoman Empire further expanded in the 16th century to include most of Slavonia, western Bosnia and [[Lika]].

Later in the same century, Croatia was so weak that its parliament authorized Ferdinand Habsburg to carve out large areas of Croatia and Slavonia adjacent to the Ottoman Empire for the creation of the [[Military Frontier]] (''Vojna Krajina'', ''German'' Militaergrenze) which would be ruled directly from Vienna's military headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SD_Vr3CTEooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Habsburg+Monarchy,+1618-1815&amp;hl=hr#PPA15,M1 |title=Charles W. Ingrao:The Habsburg monarchy, 1618–1815 page 15 |publisher=Google Books |date=29 June 2000 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area became rather deserted and was subsequently settled by [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]], Croats and [[Ethnic German|Germans]] and others. As a result of their compulsory military service to the Habsburg Empire during conflict with the Ottoman Empire, the population in the Military Frontier was free of serfdom and enjoyed much political autonomy, unlike the population living in the parts ruled by Hungary.

After the [[Bihać]] fort finally fell in 1592, only small parts of Croatia remained unconquered. The Ottoman army was successfully repelled for the first time on the territory of Croatia following the [[battle of Sisak]] in 1593. The lost territory was mostly restored, except for large parts of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

By the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was driven out of Hungary, and Austria brought the empire under central control. Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was supported by the Croatians in the [[War of Austrian Succession]] of 1741–1748 and subsequently made significant contributions to Croatian matters.

With the fall of the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1797, its possessions in eastern [[Adriatic]] became subject to a dispute between France and Austria. The Habsburgs eventually secured them (by 1815) and Dalmatia and Istria became part of the empire, though they were in [[Cisleithania]] while Croatia and Slavonia were under Hungary.

[[File:Austria-Hungary map new.svg|thumb|200px|Two parts of Triune Kingdom: Croatia-Slavonia (number 17) and Dalmatia (number 5) within Austria-Hungary]]
Croatian [[romantic nationalism]] emerged in mid-19th century to counteract the apparent [[Germanization]] and [[Magyarization]] of Croatia. The [[Illyrian movement]] attracted a number of influential figures from 1830s on, and produced some important advances in the [[Croatian language]] and culture.

In the [[the Revolutions of 1848 in Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] Croatia, driven by fear of Magyar nationalism, supported the Habsburg court against Hungarian revolutionary forces. However, despite the contributions of its ban [[Josip Jelačić|Jelačić]] in quenching the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian war of independence]], Croatia, not treated any more favourably by Vienna than the Hungarians themselves, lost its domestic autonomy. In 1867 the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|created]]; Croatian autonomy was restored in 1868 with the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] which was comparatively favourable for the Croatians, but still problematic because of issues such as the [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|unresolved status of Rijeka]].

== Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941) ==
{{Main|Croatia in the first Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]]]
Shortly before the end of the First World War in 1918, the [[Croatian Parliament]] severed relations with Austria-Hungary as the [[Little Entente|Entente]] armies defeated those of the Habsburgs. ''Croatia and Slavonia'' became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] composed out of all Southern Slavic territories of the now former [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] with a transitional government headed in [[Zagreb]]. Although the state inherited much of Austro-Hungary's military arsenal, including the entire fleet, the Kingdom of Italy moved rapidly to annex the state's most western territories, promised to her by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] of 1915. An Italian Army eventually took [[Istria]], started to annex the Adriatic islands one by one, and even landed in Zadar. After [[Srijem]] left ''Croatia and Slavonia'' and joined Serbia together with Vojvodina, which was shortly followed by a referendum to join Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia, the People's Council (''Narodno vijeće'') of the state, guided by what was by that time a half a century long tradition of [[pan-Slavism]] and without sanction of the Croatian [[sabor]], joined the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]] into the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The territory of Croatia largely comprised the territories of the [[Sava Banate|Sava]] and [[Littoral Banate]]s.

The Kingdom underwent a crucial change in 1921 to the dismay of Croatia's largest political party, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (Hrvatska seljačka stranka). The new constitution abolished the historical/political entities, including Croatia and Slavonia, centralizing authority in the capital of [[Belgrade]]. The Croatian Peasant Party boycotted the government of the Serbian [[People's Radical Party]] throughout the period, except for a brief interlude between 1925 and 1927, when external Italian expansionism was at hand with her allies, [[Albania]], Hungary, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] that threatened Yugoslavia as a whole.

In the early 1920s the Yugoslav government of Serbian prime minister [[Nikola Pasic]] used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846181,00.html Balkan Politics], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 31 March 1923&lt;/ref&gt; and other measures of [[rigged election|election rigging]] to keep the opposition, and mainly the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,719894,00.html Elections], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 23 February 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Pasic believed that Yugoslavia should be as centralized as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a [[Greater Serbia]]n national concept of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720153,00.html The Opposition], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 6 April 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2010-0420-502, Stefan Radic, cropped.jpg|thumb|right| [[Stjepan Radić]]]] During a Parliament session in 1928, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]]'s leader [[Stjepan Radić]] was mortally wounded by [[Puniša Račić]], a deputy of the Serbian Radical People's Party, which caused further upsets among the Croatian elite. In 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Aleksandar]] proclaimed a dictatorship and imposed a new constitution which, among other things, renamed the country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Political parties were banned from the start and the royal dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh character. [[Vladko Maček]], who had succeeded Radić as leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, and members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the [[Ustaše]], went into exile. According to the British historian [[Misha Glenny]] the murder in March 1929 of Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian newspaper ''Novosti'', brought a &quot;furious response&quot; from the regime. In [[Lika]] and west [[Herzegovina]] in particular, which he described as &quot;hotbeds of Croatian separatism,&quot; he wrote that the majority-Serb police acted &quot;with no restraining authority whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Misha Glenny, ''The Balkans 1804–1999'', Granta Books, London 1345, pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt; And in the words of a prominent Croatian writer, Shlegel's death became the pretext for terror in all forms. Politics was soon &quot;indistinguishable from gangsterism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josip Horvat, ''Politička povijest Hrvatske 1918–1929'' (Political History of Croatia 1918–1929), Zagreb, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Even in this oppressive climate, few rallied to the Ustaša cause and the movement was never able to organise within Croatia. But its leaders did manage to convince the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] that it was a progressive movement. The party's newspaper ''Proleter'' (December 1932) stated: &quot;[We] salute the Ustaša movement of the peasants of Lika and Dalmatia and fully support them.&quot;

In 1934, King Aleksandar was assassinated abroad, in [[Marseille]], by a coalition of the  Ustaše and a similarly radical movement, the Macedonian pro-Bulgarian [[VMORO]]. The Serbian-[[Croats|Croatian]] [[Dragiša Cvetković|Cvetković]]-Maček government that came to power, distanced Yugoslavia's former allies of France and the United Kingdom, and moved closer to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in the period of 1935–1941. A national [[Banovina of Croatia]] was created in 1939 out of the two Banates, as well as parts of the Zeta, [[Vrbas Banovina|Vrbas]], [[Drina Banovina|Drina]] and Danube Banates. It had a reconstructed Croatian Parliament which would choose a Croatian [[Ban (title)|Ban]] and Viceban. This Croatia included a part of [[Bosnia (region)]], most of [[Herzegovina]] and the city of [[Dubrovnik]] and the surroundings.

==World War II (1941–1945)==
{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}

The [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941 allowed the Croatian radical right [[Ustaše]] to come into power, forming the &quot;[[Independent State of Croatia]]&quot;, led by [[Ante Pavelić]], who assumed the role of ''Poglavnik'' (&quot;Head-man&quot;) ''Nezavisne Drzave Hrvatske'' (&quot;Leader of the Independent State of Croatia&quot;). Following the pattern of other fascist regimes in Europe, the Ustashi enacted racial laws, formed eight concentration camps targeting minority Serbs, [[Romani people|Roma]]s and Jewish populations, as well as [[Croatians|Croatian]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]]. The biggest concentration camp was [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] in Croatia. The NDH had a program, formulated by [[Mile Budak]], to purge Croatia of [[Serbs]], by &quot;killing one third, expelling the other third and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilating]] the remaining third&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The main targets for persecution, however, were the Serbs, approximately 330,000 of Serbs were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 |title=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum about Jasenovac and Independent State of Croatia |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Genocide and Resistance in Hitler's Bosnia: The Partisans and the Chetniks, 1941–1943'' pp20&lt;/ref&gt; 

The anti-fascist communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] movement, based on pan-Yugoslav ideology, emerged in early 1941, under the command of Croatian-born [[Josip Broz Tito]], spreading quickly into many parts of [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], often hailed as the first armed anti-fascist resistance [[Military unit|unit]] in occupied Europe, was formed in Croatia, in the Brezovica forest near the town of Sisak. As the movement began to gain popularity, the Partisans gained strength from Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, Slovenes, and Macedonians who believed in a unified, but federal, Yugoslav state.

By 1943, the Partisan resistance movement had gained the upper hand, against the odds, and in 1945, with help from the Soviet [[Red Army]] (passing only through small parts such as [[Vojvodina]]), expelled the Axis forces and local supporters. The ''[[ZAVNOH]]'', state anti-fascist council of people's liberation of Croatia, functioned since 1944 and formed an interim civil government. NDH's ministers of War and Internal Security [[Mladen Lorković]] and [[Ante Vokić]] tried to switch to Allied side. Pavelić was in the beginning supporting them but when he found that he would need to leave his position he imprisoned them in Lepoglava prison where they were executed.

Following the defeat of the Independent  State of Croatia at the end of the war, a large number of  [[Ustaše]], and civilians supporting them (ranging from sympathisers, young conscripts, anti-communists, and ordinary serfs who were allegedly motivated by Partisan crimes) attempted to flee in the direction of Austria hoping to surrender to British forces and to be given refuge. They were instead interned by British forces and then returned to the Partisans. A large number of these persons were killed in what has come to be called the [[Bleiburg tragedy]].

== Communist Yugoslavia (1945–1991) ==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Socialist Republic of Croatia.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]]]
[[File:SFRY Croatia.png|thumb|right|Croatia in [[SFRY]]]] {{Main|Socialist Republic of Croatia}}

===Tito's leadership of the LCY (1945–1980)===
Croatia was a [[Socialist Republic]] part of a six-part Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Under the new communist system, privately owned factories  and estates were [[nationalization|nationalized]], and the economy was based on a type of planned [[market socialism]]. The country underwent a rebuilding process, recovered from World War II, went through industrialization and started developing tourism.

The country's socialist system also provided free apartments from big companies, which with the [[workers' self-management]] investments paid for the living spaces. From 1963, the citizens of Yugoslavia were allowed to travel to almost any country because of the neutral politics. No visas were required to travel to eastern or western countries, capitalist or communist nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942012,00.html Socialism of Sorts] 10 June 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Such free travel was unheard of at the time in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, and in some western countries as well (e.g. [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]], both dictatorships at the time). This proved to be very helpful for Croatia's inhabitants who found working in foreign countries more financially rewarding. Upon retirement, a popular plan was to return to live in Croatia (then Yugoslavia) to buy a more expensive [[property]].

In Yugoslavia, the people of Croatia were guaranteed free healthcare, free dental care, and secure pensions. The older generation found this very comforting as pensions would sometimes exceed their former paychecks. Free trade and travel within the country also helped Croatian industries that imported and exported throughout all the former republics. Students and military personnel were encouraged to visit other republics to learn more about the country, and all levels of education, especially secondary education and higher education, were gratis. In reality the housing was inferior with poor heat and plumbing, the medical care often lacking even in availability of antibiotics, schools were propaganda machines and travel was a necessity to provide the country with hard currency. The propagandists who want people to believe &quot;neutral policies&quot; equalized Serbs and Croats severely restricted free speech and did not protect citizens from ethnic attacks. Membership in the party was as much a prerequisite for admission to colleges and for government jobs as in the Soviet Union under [[Joseph Stalin]] or [[Nikita Krushchev]]. Private sector businesses did not grow as the taxes on private enterprise were often prohibitive. Inexperienced management sometimes ruled  policy and controlled decisions by brute force. Strikes were forbidden, Owner/Managers were not permitted to make changes in decisions which would impact their productivity or profit.

The economy developed into a type of socialism called ''samoupravljanje'' (self-management), in which workers controlled socially-owned enterprises. This kind of market socialism created significantly better economic conditions than in the Eastern Bloc countries. Croatia went through intensive industrialization in the 1960s and 1970s with industrial output increasing several-fold and with Zagreb surpassing Belgrade for the amount of industry. Factories and other organizations were often named after [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] who were declared [[People's Hero of Yugoslavia|national heroes]]. This practice also spread to street names, names of parks and buildings and some more trivial features.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tito-gadafi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Tito meets with [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] in 1975.]] --&gt;
Before World War II, Croatia's industry was not significant, with the vast majority of the people employed in agriculture. By 1991 the country was completely transformed into a modern industrialized state. By the same time, the Croatian [[Adriatic coast]] had taken shape as an internationally popular [[tourism|tourist destination]], all coastal republics (but mostly SR Croatia) profited greatly from this, as tourist numbers reached levels still unsurpassed in modern Croatia. The government brought unprecedented economic and industrial growth, high levels of social security and a very low crime rate. The country completely recovered from WW2 and achieved a very high GDP and economic growth rate, significantly higher than the present-day Republic.

[[File:Savka Dabcevic Kucar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]], [[Croatian Spring]] participant; Europe's first female prime minister]]
The constitution of 1963 balanced the power in the country between the Croats and the Serbs, and alleviated the fact that the Croats were again in a minority. Trends after 1965 (like the fall of [[OZNA]] and [[UDBA]] chief [[Aleksandar Ranković]] from power in 1966),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905720,00.html The Specter of Separatism], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 7 February 1972&lt;/ref&gt; however, led to the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, when students in Zagreb organized demonstrations for greater civil liberties and greater Croatian autonomy. The regime stifled the public protest and incarcerated the leaders, but this led to the ratification of a new Constitution in 1974, giving more rights to the individual republics.

At that time, radical [[Ustaše]] cells of Croatian émigrés in Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,905959,00.html Conspiratorial Croats], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 5 June 1972&lt;/ref&gt; planned  and guerilla acts inside Yugoslavia, but they were largely countered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906151,00.html Battle in Bosnia], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 24 July 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===Until the break up of Yugoslavia (1980–1991)===

In 1980, after Tito's death, economic, political, and religious difficulties started to mount and the federal government began to crumble. The crisis in [[Kosovo]] and, in 1986, the emergence of [[Slobodan Milošević]] in Serbia provoked a very negative reaction in Croatia and [[Slovenia]]; politicians from both republics feared that his motives would threaten their republics' autonomy. With the climate of change throughout Eastern Europe during the 1980s, the communist hegemony was challenged (at the same time, the Milošević government began to gradually [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|concentrate Yugoslav power in Serbia]] and calls for free multi-party elections were becoming louder. In June 1989 the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) was founded by Croatian nationalist dissidents led by [[Franjo Tuđman]] a former fighter in Tito's Partisan movement and [[JNA]] General. At this time Yugoslavia was still a one-party state and open manifestations of Croatian nationalism were dangerous so new party was founded in an almost conspiratorial manner.  It was only on 13 December 1989 that the governing [[League of Communists of Croatia]] agreed to legalize opposition political parties and hold free elections in the spring of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 14 December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1990 at its 14th Congress the Communist League of Yugoslavia voted to remove its monopoly on political power, but the same day effectively ceased to exist as a national party when the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] walked out after Serbia's [[Slobodan Milošević]] blocked all their reformist proposals – the [[League of Communists of Croatia]] walked out soon after.

==Independence==

===Political changes===
{{main|Independence of Croatia}}
On 22 April and 7 May 1990, the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first free multi-party elections]] were held in Croatia. [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) won by a relatively slim margin against [[Ivica Račan]]'s reformed communist [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Party of Democratic Change]] (SDP). However, Croatia's [[first-past-the-post]] election system enabled Tuđman to form the government relatively independently. The HDZ's intentions were to secure independence for Croatia, contrary to the wishes of a part of the ethnic Serbs in the republic, and federal and national politicians in Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate soon escalated into complete estrangement between the two nations and spiralled into sectarian violence.

On 25 July 1990, a Serbian Assembly was established in [[Srb]], north of Knin, as the political representation of the Serbian people in Croatia. The Serbian Assembly declared &quot;sovereignty and autonomy of the Serb people in Croatia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;icty babic2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor vs. Milan Martic (paragraph 127–150) | author=ICTY  |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612.pdf |publisher=ICTY |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their position was that if Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia.  [[Milan Babić]], a dentist from the southern town of [[Knin]], was elected president. The rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of paramilitary militias under the leadership of [[Milan Martić]], the police chief in Knin. On 17 August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the [[Log Revolution]], where barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia.  This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of [[Dalmatia]] from the rest of the country.  The Croatian government responded to the blockade of roads by sending special police teams in helicopters to the scene, but they were intercepted by [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]] fighter jets and forced to turn back to [[Zagreb]].

The [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian constitution]] was passed in December 1990 categorizing Serbs as a minority group along with other ethnic groups. Babić's administration announced the creation of a [[SAO Krajina|Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina]] (or ''SAO Krajina'') on 21 December 1990. Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the [[Zagreb]] government.
 
On [[Easter Sunday]], 31 March 1991, the first fatal clashes occurred when Croatian police from the Croatian Ministry of the Interior (MUP) entered the [[Plitvice Lakes incident|Plitvice Lakes]] national park to expel rebel Serb forces. Serb paramilitaries ambushed a bus carrying Croatian police into the national park on the road north of [[Korenica]], sparking a day-long gun battle between the two sides. During the fighting, two people, one Croat and one Serb policeman, were killed. Twenty other people were injured and twenty-nine Krajina Serb paramilitaries and policemen were taken prisoner by Croatian forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldstein&quot;&gt;Ivo Goldstein, ''Croatia: A History'', p. 220. (C. Hurst &amp; Co, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihailo Crnobrnja, ''The Yugoslav Drama'', p. 157; (McGill-Queens University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prisoners was [[Goran Hadžić]], later to become the President of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Judah |title=The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia |pages=175–76, 244|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1991 the [[Parliament of Croatia|Croatian parliament]] voted to hold a referendum on independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeno/1991/0646.htm |title= Odluka Predsjednika RH o raspisu referenduma |publisher=[[Narodne novine]] |language=Croatian| accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 1991, on an almost 80% turnout, 93.24% voted for independence. [[Krajina]] boycotted the referendum. They held their own referendum a week earlier on 12 May 1991 in the territories they controlled and voted to remain in Yugoslavia which the Croatian government did not recognize as valid.

On 25 June 1991 the [[Parliament of Croatia]] declared independence from Yugoslavia. Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/nation/cat/croatia/fcroatia1991.htm |title=Yugoslavia Serbia Croatia War 1991 |publisher=Onwar.com |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of Independence (1991–1995)===

{{Main|Croatian War of Independence}}
The civilian population fled the areas of armed conflict ''en masse'': generally speaking, hundreds of thousands of Croats moved away from the Bosnian and Serbian border areas, while thousands of Serbs moved towards it. In many places, masses of civilians were forced out by the [[Yugoslav National Army]] (JNA), who consisted mostly of conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and irregulars from Serbia, in what became known as [[ethnic cleansing]].

The border city of [[Vukovar]] underwent a three month siege – the [[Battle of Vukovar]] — during which most of the city was destroyed and a majority of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to the Serbian forces on 18 November 1991 and the [[Vukovar massacre]] occurred.

Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] where a new cycle of tensions were escalating: the [[Bosnian War]] was to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled an estimated 700,000 refugees from Bosnia, mainly [[Bosnian Muslims]].

Armed conflict in Croatia remained intermittent and mostly on a small scale until 1995. In early August, Croatia embarked on [[Operation Storm]]. The Croatian attack quickly reconquered most of the territories from the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] authorities, leading to a mass exodus of the Serbian population. An estimated 90,000–350,000 Serbs fled shortly before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/d0cd11bdf1350357802566d60046e3b7?Opendocument |title=Croatian report from 1995 |publisher=Unhchr.ch |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/report/info/EUR64/002/2005 Amnesty International report]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the operation. As a result of this operation, a few months later the [[Bosnian war]] ended with the negotiation of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. A peaceful integration of the remaining [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia|Serbian-controlled territories in eastern Slavonia]] was completed in 1998 under UN supervision. The majority of the Serbs who fled from the former [[Krajina]] have not returned due to fears of ethnic violence, discrimination and property repossession problems, and the Croatian government has yet to achieve the conditions for full reintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/croatia |title=World Report 2011: Croatia &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, around 125,000 ethnic Serbs who fled the 1991–1995 conflict are registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom around 55,000 remain permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/79189 |title=Croatia &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since the end of the war===
{{main|History of Croatia since 1995}}

Croatia became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1996. 1996 and 1997 were a period of post-war recovery and improving economic conditions. However, in 1998 and 1999 Croatia experienced an economic depression, causing the unemployment of thousands of citizens.

The remaining part of former &quot;Krajina&quot;, areas adjacent to [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]], negotiated a peaceful reintegration process with the Croatian Government. The so-called [[Erdut Agreement]] made the area a temporary protectorate of the [[UN Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]]. The area was formally re-integrated into Croatia by 1998.

[[Franjo Tuđman]]'s government started to lose popularity as it was criticized (among other things) for its involvement in [[Croatian privatization controversy|suspicious privatization deals of the early 1990s]] as well as a partial international isolation. The country experienced a mild [[recession]] in 1998 and 1999.

Tuđman died in 1999 and in the early [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]], the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) government was replaced by a center-left coalition under the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], with [[Ivica Račan]] as prime minister. At the same time, [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]] were held which were won by a moderate, [[Stjepan Mesić]]. The new Račan government amended the Constitution, changing the political system from a [[presidential system]] to a [[parliamentary system]], transferring most executive presidential powers from the president onto the institutions of the Parliament and the Prime Minister.

The new government also started several large building projects, including state-sponsored [[house|housing]], more rebuilding efforts to enable refugee return, and the building of the [[A1 (Croatia)|A1 highway]]. The country achieved notable economic growth during these years, while the unemployment rate would continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started falling. Croatia became a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) member in 2000 and started the [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union]] in 2003.

In late 2003, [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|new parliamentary elections]] were held and a reformed HDZ party won under leadership of [[Ivo Sanader]], who became prime minister. European accession was delayed by controversies over the extradition of army generals to the [[ICTY]], including the runaway [[Ante Gotovina]]. 
Sanader was reelected in the closely contested [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]]. Other complications continued to stall the EU negotiating process, most notably [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] in 2008&amp;ndash;2009.

In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, and named [[Jadranka Kosor]] in his place. Kosor introduced [[austerity]] measures to counter the economic crisis and launched an anti-corruption campaign aimed at public officials. In late 2009, Kosor signed an agreement with [[Borut Pahor]], the premier of [[Slovenia]], that allowed the EU accession to proceed.

In the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010]], [[Ivo Josipović]], the candidate of the SDP won a landslide victory.
Sanader tried to come back into HDZ in 2010, but was then ejected, and [[USKOK]] soon had him arrested on several corruption charges. {{As of|2012}}, his trial is ongoing.

In 2011, the accession agreement was concluded, giving Croatia the all-clear to join, with a projected accession date of 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/824&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA – Press Releases – EU closes accession negotiations with Croatia |work=Europa (web portal) |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]] was held on 4 December 2011, and the [[Kukuriku coalition]] won.
