[[File:Trojan1.jpg|thumb|An early [[nuclear power plant]] that used atomic energy to generate electricity.]]
The '''Atomic Age''', also known as the ''Atomic Era'', is a phrase typically used to delineate the period of history following the detonation of the first [[nuclear bomb|atomic bomb]], [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]], on July 16, 1945. Although nuclear science existed before this event, the following bombing of [[Hiroshima|Hiroshima, Japan]] represented the first large-scale, use of [[nuclear technology]] and ushered in profound changes in [[politics|socio-political]] thinking and the course of technology development. [[Nuclear power|Atomic power]] was seen to be the epitome of progress and modernity.&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt;

However, the Atomic Age fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology has produced a range of social problems, from the arms race, to the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and [[Three Mile Island accident]], and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
In 1901, [[Frederick Soddy]] and [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that [[radioactivity]] was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another, involving the release of energy. Soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially “inexhaustible” source of energy, and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to “transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen poles, and make the whole earth one smiling Garden of Eden.” The promise of an “atomic age,” with nuclear energy as the global, utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs, has been a recurring theme ever since. But &quot;Soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~aglaser/2006aglaser_nuclearcrowd.pdf |title=Life in a Nuclear Powered Crowd |author=Zia Mian and Alexander Glaser |date=June 2006  |work=INESAP Information Bulletin No.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atomic vs. nuclear==
The two words atomic and nuclear are synonymous in the context of atomic power and weapons. The atom consists of a nucleus and one or more electrons. All atomic reactions involve changing one atom into another by changing the nucleus. Historically atomic power is an older term, and nuclear power is newer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Deterrence/Atomsforpeace.shtml President Eisenhower's &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
The phrase &quot;''Atomic Age''&quot; was coined by [[William L. Laurence]], a [[New York Times]] [[journalist]] who became the official journalist for the U.S. [[Manhattan Project]] which developed the first nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;laurence19450926&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2fpLSlthuEMC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;ots=vv5mTfKJUM&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Drama of the Atomic Bomb Found Climax in July 16 Test | work=The New York Times | date=1945-09-26 | accessdate=October 01, 2012 | author=Laurence, William L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ATOMIC TRUTHS PLAGUE PRIZE COVERUP|last=Gonzalez|first=Juan|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2005/08/09/2005-08-09_atomic_truths_plague_prize_c.html|date=9 August 2005|quote=Laurence, the only journalist the U.S. government permitted to witness the bombing of Nagasaki, is also the reporter who first coined the term &quot;Atomic Age.&quot; ... Soon after the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Laurence launched his Times series, where he extolled the bomb and sought to discredit other accounts about effects of the bomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed both the [[Trinity test]] and the bombing of [[Nagasaki]] and went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;On this incident, see David Holloway, ''Stalin and the Bomb: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939-1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994): 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union would go on to test [[RDS-1|its first nuclear weapon]] in 1949.

In 1949, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, [[David Lilienthal]] stated that &quot;atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy, but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man's whole life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1950s ==
{{further|Atomic Age (design)}}
The phrase gained popularity as a feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] would render all conventional explosives obsolete and [[nuclear power]] plants would do the same for power sources such as [[coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from [[Food irradiation|irradiating food]] to preserve it, to the development of [[nuclear medicine]]. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would &quot;provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thristy, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space&quot;.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in [[technological progress]] as the first smelting of [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], of [[Iron Age|Iron]], or the commencement of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

This included even [[automobile|car]]s, leading [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] to display the [[Ford Nucleon]] [[concept car]] to the public in 1958. There was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and nuclear-powered airplanes, which the US federal government even spent US $1.5 billion researching.&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; Nuclear policymaking became almost a collective technocratic fantasy, or at least was driven by fantasy:&lt;ref name=sh96&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The very idea of splitting the atom had an almost magical grip on the imaginations of inventors and policymakers. As soon as someone said – in an even mildly credible way – that these things ''could'' be done, then people quickly convinced themselves ... that they ''would'' be done.&lt;ref name=sh96/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the USA, military planners &quot;believed that demonstrating the civilian applications of the atom would also affirm the American system of private enterprise, showcase the expertise of scientists, increase personal living standards, and defend the democratic lifestyle against communism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media reports predicted that thanks to the giant nuclear power stations of the near future [[electricity]] would soon become much cheaper and that [[electricity meter]]s would be removed, because power would be &quot;[[too cheap to meter]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html |title=Too Cheap to Meter? |accessdate=2007-06-17 |date=2007-03-30 |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Society]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070204122504/http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality was that the Shippingport reactor went online in 1957 producing electricity at a cost roughly ten times that of coal-fired generation. Scientists at the AEC's own Brookhaven Laboratory &quot;wrote a 1958 report describing accident scenarios in which 3,000 people would die immediately, with another 40,000 injured&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear of possible atomic attack from the Soviet Union caused U.S. school children to participate in &quot;duck and cover&quot; civil defense drills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-kelly/remember-duck-and-cover-w_b_774134.html Remember Duck and Cover? What Safety Experts May Have Been Thinking]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1960s ==
At the peak of the Atomic Age, the US Federal government initiated [[Operation Plowshare|Project Plowshare]], a program for using nuclear weapons for “peaceful nuclear explosions”. The Project “was named directly from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another”.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; Proposed uses included widening the [[Panama Canal]], constructing a new sea-level waterway through [[Nicaragua]] nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems.  Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage.  It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract [[shale oil]] in eastern [[Utah]] and western [[Colorado]].  Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations.  One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground [[aquifer]]s in [[Arizona]].  Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of [[California]]'s [[Sacramento Valley]] for a water transport project.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.&lt;ref name=bks171&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' TV series, a set of vehicles was presented that were imagined to be completely nuclear, as shown in cutaways presented in their comic-books.

The term &quot;atomic age&quot; was initially used in a positive, futuristic sense, but by the 1960s the threats posed by [[nuclear weapon]]s had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom.

== 1970 to 2000 ==
[[File:View of Chernobyl taken from Pripyat.JPG|thumb|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]] with Chernobyl plant in the distance]]
French advocates of nuclear power developed an aesthetic vision of nuclear technology as art to bolster support for the technology. Leclerq compares the nuclear cooling tower to some of the grandest architectural monuments of western culture:&lt;ref name=jbsh/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The age in which we live has, for the public, been marked by the nuclear engineer and the gigantic edifices he has created. For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.&lt;ref name=jbsh&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century, one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the USA.  But after 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose.  Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Cooke]] (2009). ''[[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]'', Black Inc., p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1970s, nuclear power was faced with economic difficulties and widespread [[anti-nuclear movement|public unease]], coming to a head in the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, both of which affected the nuclear power industry for decades thereafter. A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' commented on the overall management of the nuclear power program in the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale … only the blind, or the biased, can now think that the money has been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nuclear Follies&quot;, a February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== After 2000 ==
[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe crop.jpg|thumb|The 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in Japan, the worst [[nuclear accident]] in 25 years, displaced 50,000 households after [[radiation]] leaked into the air, soil and sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/fukushima-retiree-to-lead-anti-nuclear-motion.html |title=Fukushima Retiree Leads Anti-Nuclear Shareholders at Tepco Annual Meeting |author=Tomoko Yamazaki and Shunichi Ozasa  |date=June 27, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 21st century, the label of the &quot;Atomic Age&quot; connotes either a sense of [[nostalgia]] or naïveté, and is considered by many to have ended with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, though the term continues to be used by some historians to describe the era following the conclusion of the [[Second World War]].  The term is used by some [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] to describe not only the era following the conclusion of the Second World War but also [[contemporary history]] up to the present day.

[[Nuclear technology]] was originally suggested as a solution to the [[peak oil|oil crisis]] that threatens the world's supply of energy, and has been offered as a solution to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.&lt;ref name=globen/&gt; Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Hugh Gusterson  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Paton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says  |author=James Paton |date=April 4, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.&lt;ref name=globen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author=Jacobson, Mark Z. and Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that if nuclear power use tripled from 2005–2055 (from 2%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2008-1994/WEO_2007.pdf World Energy Outlook 2007] pp 74,360&lt;/ref&gt; to 7%), at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/docs/policy-briefs/201101_RSU_PolicyBrief_1-2nd_Thought_Nuclear-Sovacool.pdf |title=Second Thoughts About Nuclear Power |author=Benjamin K.

In September 2012, Japan announced that it would completely phase out nuclear power by 2030, joining with Germany, and other countries in reaction to the accident at Fukushima. It will be many decades before the radioactive legacy of the aborted atomic age will be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countercurrents.org/cc170912A.htm Japan Plans To Abandon Nuclear Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the atomic age began with the explosion of a test bomb, the duck and cover age is long past, but risk of nuclear explosion will continue until the last nuclear weapon is dismantled. Nuclear power, in hindsight, has four unsurmontable problems, radiation, waste, accident, and the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm Energy: Choices for Environment and Development] November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
