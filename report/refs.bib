  abstract =	"We present a content-driven reputation system for
		 Wikipedia authors. In our system, authors gain
		 reputation when the edits they perform to Wikipedia
		 articles are preserved by subsequent authors, and they
		 lose reputation when their edits are rolled back or
		 undone in short order. Thus, author reputation is
		 computed solely on the basis of content evolution;
		 user-to-user comments or ratings are not used. The
		 author reputation we compute could be used to flag new
		 contributions from low-reputation authors, or it could
		 be used to allow only authors with high reputation to
		 contribute to controversial or critical pages. A
		 reputation system for the Wikipedia could also provide
		 an incentive for high-quality contributions. We have
		 implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to
		 analyze the entire Italian and French Wikipedias,
		 consisting of a total of 691,551 pages and 5,587,523
		 revisions. Our results show that our notion of
		 reputation has good predictive value: changes performed
		 by low-reputation authors have a significantly larger
		 than average probability of having poor quality, as
		 judged by human observers, and of being later undone,
		 as measured by our algorithms.",

		 large enough to deal with this. As the number of
		 entries went up for anon users, quality got worse; for
